chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook
that had its source away back in the woods of the old cuthbert place it was reputed to be an intricate headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods with dark secrets of pool and cascade but by the time it reached lyndes hollow it was a quiet well conducted little stream
for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lyndes door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up
and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbors business by dint of neglecting their own
but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle
helped run the sunday school and was the strongest prop of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary yet with all this missus rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window knitting cotton warp quilts she had knitted sixteen of them
as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond
anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of missus rachels all seeing eye she was sitting there one afternoon in early june the sun was coming in at the window warm and bright
the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky white bloom hummed over by a myriad of bees thomas lynde a meek little man whom avonlea people called rachel lyndes husband was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn
missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blairs store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon
peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill
and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there
had it been any other man in avonlea missus rachel deftly putting this and that together might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him
he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk matthew dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy was something that didnt happen often missus rachel ponder as she might could make nothing of it
and her afternoons enjoyment was spoiled ill just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where hes gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesnt generally go to town this time of year and he never visits
if hed run out of turnip seed he wouldnt dress up and take the buggy to go for more
yet something must have happened since last night to start him off im clean puzzled thats what and i wont know a minutes peace of mind or conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea today accordingly after tea missus rachel set out she had not far to go
the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lyndes hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthberts father as shy and silent as his son after him
had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day
barely visible from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so sociably situated missus rachel lynde did not call living in such a place living at all its just staying thats what she said as she stepped along the deep rutted grassy lane
bordered with wild rose bushes its no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees arent much company though dear knows if they were thered be enough of them id ruther look at people to be sure
they seem contented enough but then i suppose theyre used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard
set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim lombardies not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen for missus rachel would have seen it if there had been privately she was of the opinion that marilla cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house
one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment
or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor its windows looked east and west through the west one looking out on the back yard came a flood of mellow june sunlight but the east one
whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry trees in the left orchard and nodding slender birches down in the hollow by the brook was greened over by a tangle of vines here sat marilla cuthbert when she sat at all always slightly distrustful of sunshine
and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door
there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company
yet what of matthews white collar and the sorrel mare missus rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet unmysterious green gables good evening rachel marilla said briskly this is a real fine evening isnt it wont you sit down
how are all your folks something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between marilla cuthbert and missus rachel in spite of or perhaps because of their dissimilarity marilla was a tall
thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was
but there was a saving something about her mouth which if it had been ever so slightly developed might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor were all pretty well said missus rachel i was kind of afraid you werent though when i saw matthew starting off today i thought maybe he was going to the doctors
marillas lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbors curiosity oh no im quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said
matthew went to bright river were getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and hes coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished
she was actually stricken dumb for five seconds it was unsupposable that marilla was making fun of her but missus rachel was almost forced to suppose it are you in earnest marilla she demanded when voice returned to her yes of course
said marilla as if getting boys from orphan asylums in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well regulated avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation missus rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt she thought in exclamation points
marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing
what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well weve been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla
missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring
so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought wed get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know hes sixty and he isnt so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard its got to be to get hired help
theres never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something hes up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that
they may be all right im not saying theyre not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least therell be a risk no matter who we get but ill feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian
so in the end we decided to ask missus spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl we heard last week she was going so we sent her word by richard spencers folks at carmody to bring us a smart likely boy of about ten or eleven we decided that would be the best age
old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight
so matthew went to bright river to meet him missus spencer will drop him off there of course she goes on to white sands station herself missus rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind she proceeded to speak it now having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news
well marilla ill just tell you plain that i think youre doing a mighty foolish thing a risky thing thats what you dont know what youre getting youre bringing a strange child into your house and home and you dont know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had
nor how hes likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds
and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldnt break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didnt do marilla id have said for mercys sake not to think of such a thing thats what
this jobs comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i dont deny theres something in what you say rachel ive had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in
its so seldom matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does i always feel its my duty to give in and as for the risk theres risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world theres risks in peoples having children of their own if it comes to that they dont always turn out well
and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isnt as if we were getting him from england or the states he cant be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts
only dont say i didnt warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well i heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies only it was a girl in that instance well were not getting a girl said marilla
as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy id never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldnt shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head
missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bells and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none
and missus rachel dearly loved to make a sensation so she took herself away somewhat to marillas relief for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of missus rachels pessimism well of all things that ever were or will be ejaculated missus rachel when she was safely out in the lane
it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well im sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla dont know anything about children and theyll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather
it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow theres never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldnt be in that orphans shoes for anything
my but i pity him thats what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart
chapter two matthew cuthbert is surprised matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to bright river it was a pretty road running along between snug farmsteads with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through
or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom the air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple while the little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year
matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them for in prince edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not matthew dreaded all women except marilla and missus rachel
he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders
and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train
he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end
matthew barely noting that it was a girl sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression she was sitting there waiting for something or somebody
and since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then she sat and waited with all her might and main matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper and asked him if the five thirty train would soon be along
the five thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago answered that brisk official but there was a passenger dropped off for you a little girl shes sitting out there on the shingles i asked her to go into the ladies waiting room but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside
shes a case i should say im not expecting a girl said matthew blankly its a boy ive come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled
guess theres some mistake he said missus spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently thats all i know about it and i havent got any more orphans concealed hereabouts
i dont understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well youd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say shell be able to explain shes got a tongue of her own thats certain
maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl
and demand of her why she wasnt a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her
a child of about eleven garbed in a very short very tight very ugly dress of yellowish gray wincey she wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat extending down her back were two braids of very thick decidedly red hair
her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer
might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded
was so ludicrously afraid matthew however was spared the ordeal of speaking first for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby old fashioned carpet bag the other she held out to him
i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice im very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you werent coming for me
i had made up my mind that if you didnt come for me to night
i wouldnt be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine dont you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldnt you
matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his then and there he decided what to do he could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake he would take her home and let marilla do that she couldnt be left at bright river anyhow
no matter what mistake had been made so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at green gables im sorry i was late he said shyly come along the horse is over in the yard give me your bag oh i can carry it the child responded cheerfully
it isnt heavy ive got all my worldly goods in it but it isnt heavy and if it isnt carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out so id better keep it because i know the exact knack of it its an extremely old carpet bag oh im very glad youve come even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry tree
weve got to drive a long piece havent we missus spencer said it was eight miles im glad because i love driving oh it seems so wonderful that im going to live with you and belong to you ive never belonged to anybody not really but the asylum was the worst ive only been in it four months but that was enough
its worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that
they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them
who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didnt have time in the day i guess thats why im so thin i am dreadful thin aint i there isnt a pick on my bones
i do love to imagine im nice and plump with dimples in my elbows with this matthews companion stopped talking partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill
the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks fringed with blooming wild cherry trees and slim white birches were several feet above their heads the child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy
isnt that beautiful what did that tree leaning out from the bank all white and lacy make you think of she asked well now i dunno said matthew why a bride of course a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil
ive never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i dont ever expect to be a bride myself im so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightnt be very particular
but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and ive never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course its all the more to look forward to isnt it and then
i can imagine that im dressed gorgeously this morning when i left the asylum i felt so ashamed because i had to wear this horrid old wincey dress all the orphans had to wear them you know a merchant in hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum some people said it was because he couldnt sell it
but id rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart wouldnt you when we got on the train i felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me but i just went to work and imagined that i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while
and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes and a gold watch and kid gloves and boots i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island with all my might i wasnt a bit sick coming over in the boat neither was missus spencer although she generally is
she said she hadnt time to get sick watching to see that i didnt fall overboard she said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about but if it kept her from being seasick its a mercy i did prowl isnt it and i wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat because i didnt know whether id ever have another opportunity
oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and im so glad im going to live here ive always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world
and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would its delightful when your imaginations come true isnt it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red
and she said she didnt know and for pitys sake not to ask her any more questions she said i must have asked her a thousand already i suppose i had too but how you going to find out about things if you dont ask questions and what does make the roads red well now i dunno said matthew
thered be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didnt talk if you say so ill stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although its difficult matthew
was enjoying himself like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it but he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl women were bad enough in all conscience but little girls were worse
he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different
and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes
chapter ninety nine the law we have seen how quietly
the fact being that every one was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness
who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugenies character
for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection now
an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover
not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugenie had not taken place
not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it
had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil
was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments
debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him
still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugenie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play
and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs
awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed
with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman at twenty minutes of twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock
the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugenie used in leaving it she ran lightly up stairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugenie she was fearful of exciting any remark
and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at eugenies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening
and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugenie said the maid
after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer
madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult
who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugenie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame
for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound
and her glance was turned towards heaven
and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin
and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one
supported by an honorable name how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her
debray could but give her advice she must apply to some one more powerful than he
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption
it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way
no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues
appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least
obtain all the indulgence he could allow she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days
he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court and after this reasoning she slept easily
at nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running down stairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minutes air showing the scared face of a footman
and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice
madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady
first madame who are you who am i you know me well enough we no longer know any one madame
where do you come from oh this is too much madame these are my orders excuse me your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times
possibly madame and now what do you want
madame this is precaution not impertinence
or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet but enough of this here is my card
take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street she had not long to wait
directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it
you will excuse this poor fellow madame
in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it
raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious
you too then are unhappy she said yes madame replied the magistrate then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sir a fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness alas madame
said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort
your daughter will be married to morrow if not to day in a week if not to morrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity
said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him well then be more affectionate my dear villefort
said the baroness speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed when i hear misfortunes named madame
he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes
but this annoys you let us change the subject you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor
certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others impostor indeed
is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued
i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisoners afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head at least keep him there till my daughter be married
impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest for all even for myself among the rest
replied villefort ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months
have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly yes you were thinking of it and with justice
you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now
the baroness became pale you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you
then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown
villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen
this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin
and who is this wretch who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no one owned him no one his parents are unknown
but who was the man who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hands
for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heavens sake
what am i the law has the law any eyes to witness your grief
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall no madame
and when it commands it strikes you will tell me that i am a living being and not a code a man and not a volume look at me madame
have mankind treated me as a brother have they loved me have they spared me has any one shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands no madame they struck me always struck me
woman siren that you are
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others
i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error
every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness
with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words
this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better
but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us
oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven at least
delay the trial till the next assizes
no madame said villefort instructions have been given
five days are more than i require
i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence
i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute
a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior
madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiegne and all is over
pale and cold adieu sir she said adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door
chapter seventeen when wendy grew up i hope you want to know what became of the other boys they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up
they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression they stood in a row in front of missus darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them
but they forgot about him of course missus darling said at once that she would have them but mister darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number i must say he said to wendy
that you dont do things by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir because if so we can go away
father wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it we could lie doubled up said nibs i always cut their hair myself said wendy
george missus darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light then he burst into tears and the truth came out he was as glad to have them as she was he said
but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers
i dont think he is a cypher tootles cried instantly do you think he is a cypher curly no i dont do you think he is a cypher slightly rather not twin what do you think
it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they fitted in well fit in sir they assured him then follow the leader he cried gaily
mind you i am not sure that we have a drawing room but we pretend we have and its all the same hoop la he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la and danced after him searching for the drawing room and i forget whether they found it
but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
that is what she did hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes you dont feel peter she said falteringly
that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject no about me peter no missus darling came to the window
would you send me to school he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so
very soon i dont want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately i dont want to be a man o wendys mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard
and missus darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her keep back lady
but where are you going to live with tink in the house we built for wendy the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights how lovely cried wendy so longingly that missus darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairies were dead missus darling said
because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
i shall have tink tink cant go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly
tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesnt matter peter said o peter you know it matters
may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he does so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely
long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again
i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you wont forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes of course peter promised and then he flew away he took missus darlings kiss with him
the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily funny but she seemed satisfied of course all the boys went to school
but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed michael believed longer than the other boys
though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself
she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind who is captain hook
when she spoke of the arch enemy dont you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said
who is tinker bell o peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairies dont live long
but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter
but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops next year he did not come for her she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
perhaps he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying
peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains
and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter was no more to her
than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door that used to be tootles the bearded man who doesnt know any story to tell his children
and always had an odd inquiring look
when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
who was no longer fond of stairs missus darling was now dead and forgotten there were only two beds in the nursery now janes and her nurses and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself once a week janes nurse had her evening off
and then it was wendys part to put jane to bed that was the time for stories it was janes invention to raise the sheet over her mothers head and her own thus making a tent
i dont think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation yes you do says jane
that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
why cant you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless
or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane go on
they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow
you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying
yes that was it says jane with a big breath and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids lagoon
yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing yes but alas he forgot all about me
wendy said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said
trying to imitate peters crow no it wasnt jane said gravely
jane said ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy it was the spring of the year
wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old
he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty
a big woman hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first hullo peter
she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me hullo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed
john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane
that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her peter looked hullo is it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass i cant come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly ill soon teach you again o peter dont waste the fairy dust on me
what is it he cried shrinking
for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid dont turn up the light he cried she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy she was not a little girl heart broken about him
she was a grown woman smiling at it all
then she turned up the light and peter saw he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply what is it he cried again she had to tell him
i am old peter i am ever so much more than twenty i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldnt help it
no youre not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no shes not
of course he did not strike
and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
boy she said why are you crying peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter pan he told her
yes i know i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously
while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy she is my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him
he does so need a mother jane said yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him
it was already her easiest way of moving about wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you cant fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
our last glimpse of her shows her at the window
as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him stories about himself to which he listens eagerly when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peters mother in turn
he took a resolve after this not to misinterpret her words even when miss stackpole appeared to strike the personal note most strongly he bethought himself that persons in her view were simple and homogeneous organisms
to deal with her in strict reciprocity he carried out his resolve with a great deal of tact and the young lady found in renewed contact with him no obstacle to the exercise of her genius for unshrinking enquiry
the general application of her confidence her situation at gardencourt therefore appreciated as we have seen her to be by isabel and full of appreciation herself of that free play of intelligence
she presently discovered in truth that this obligation was of the lightest and that missus touchett cared very little how miss stackpole behaved missus touchett had defined her to isabel
as both an adventuress and a bore adventuresses usually giving one more of a thrill she had expressed some surprise at her nieces having selected such a friend
yet had immediately added that she knew isabels friends were her own affair and that she had never undertaken to like them all or to restrict the girl to those she liked
my dear youd have a very small society missus touchett frankly admitted and i dont think i like any man or woman well enough to recommend them to you when it comes to recommending its a serious affair
i dont like miss stackpole everything about her displeases me she talks so much too loud and looks at one as if one wanted to look at her which one doesnt
im sure she has lived all her life in a boarding house and i detest the manners and the liberties of such places if you ask me if i prefer my own manners which you doubtless think very bad ill tell you that i prefer them immensely
and she detests me for detesting it
missus touchett was right in guessing that henrietta disapproved of her but she had not quite put her finger on the reason a day or two after miss stackpoles arrival
which excited a vein of counter argument on the part of the correspondent of the interviewer who in the exercise of her profession had acquainted herself in the western world with every form of caravansary
ralph with his experimental geniality suggested by way of healing the breach that the truth lay between the two extremes and that the establishments in question ought to be described as fair middling
this contribution to the discussion however miss stackpole rejected with scorn middling indeed if they were not the best in the world they were the worst but there was nothing middling about an american hotel
i like to be treated as an american lady poor american ladies cried missus touchett with a laugh theyre the slaves of slaves theyre the companions of freemen henrietta retorted
theyre the companions of their servants the irish chambermaid and the negro waiter they share their work do you call the domestics in an american household slaves miss stackpole enquired
if thats the way you desire to treat them no wonder you dont like america if youve not good servants youre miserable missus touchett serenely said theyre very bad in america but ive five perfect ones in florence
i dont see what you want with five henrietta couldnt help observing i dont think i should like to see five persons surrounding me in that menial position
should you like me better if i were your butler dear her husband asked i dont think i should you wouldnt at all have the tenue the companions of freemen i like that miss stackpole said ralph
its a beautiful description when i said freemen i didnt mean you sir and this was the only reward that ralph got for his compliment miss stackpole was baffled
which she privately judged to be a mysterious survival of feudalism it was perhaps because her mind was oppressed with this image that she suffered some days to elapse before she took occasion to say to isabel
my dear friend i wonder if youre growing faithless faithless faithless to you henrietta no that would be a great pain but its not that faithless to my country then
that i hope will never be when i wrote to you from liverpool i said i had something particular to tell you youve never asked me what it is is it because youve suspected suspected what
you dont ask that right as if you thought it important youre changed youre thinking of other things tell me what you mean and ill think of that will you really think of it thats what i wish to be sure of
ive not much control of my thoughts but ill do my best said isabel henrietta gazed at her in silence for a period which tried isabels patience so that our heroine added at last
isabel responded you say that right i had a good deal of talk with him he has come after you did he tell you so no he told me nothing thats how i knew it said henrietta cleverly
he said very little about you but i spoke of you a good deal isabel waited at the mention of mister goodwoods name she had turned a little pale im very sorry you did that she observed at last
i could have talked a long time to such a listener he was so quiet so intense he drank it all in what did you say about me isabel asked i said you were on the whole the finest creature i know
while i talked i never saw an ugly man look so handsome hes very simple minded said isabel and hes not so ugly theres nothing so simplifying as a grand passion
its not a grand passion im very sure its not that you dont say that as if you were sure isabel gave rather a cold smile i shall say it better to mister goodwood himself
isabel offered no answer to this assertion which her companion made with an air of great confidence hell find you changed the latter pursued youve been affected by your new surroundings very likely im affected by everything
by everything but mister goodwood miss stackpole exclaimed with a slightly harsh hilarity isabel failed even to smile back and in a moment she said did he ask you to speak to me not in so many words
but his eyes asked it and his handshake when he bade me good bye thank you for doing so and isabel turned away yes youre changed youve got new ideas over here her friend continued i hope so said isabel
one should get as many new ideas as possible yes but they shouldnt interfere with the old ones when the old ones have been the right ones isabel turned about again if you mean that i had any idea with regard to mister goodwood
but she faltered before her friends implacable glitter my dear child you certainly encouraged him isabel made for the moment as if to deny this charge instead of which however she presently answered
its very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mister goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject
and found henrietta wanting in delicacy i asked him and he said he meant to do nothing miss stackpole answered but i dont believe that hes not a man to do nothing he is a man of high bold action
and whatever he does will always be right i quite believe that henrietta might be wanting in delicacy but it touched the girl all the same to hear this declaration ah you do care for him her visitor rang out
whatever he does will always be right isabel repeated when a mans of that infallible mould what does it matter to him what one feels it may not matter to him but it matters to ones self ah
i hope hell hate me then said isabel i believe you hope it about as much as i believe him capable of it to this observation our heroine made no return
she was absorbed in the alarm given her by henriettas intimation that caspar goodwood would present himself at gardencourt she pretended to herself however that she thought the event impossible and later
she communicated her disbelief to her friend for the next forty eight hours nevertheless she stood prepared to hear the young mans name announced the feeling pressed upon her it made the air sultry
and after strolling about for some time in a manner at once listless and restless had seated herself on a garden bench within sight of the house beneath a spreading beech where in a white dress ornamented with black ribbons
she formed among the flickering shadows a graceful and harmonious image
as to whom the proposal of an ownership divided with her cousin had been applied as impartially as possible as impartially as bunchies own somewhat fickle and inconstant sympathies would allow
but she was notified for the first time on this occasion of the finite character of bunchies intellect hitherto she had been mainly struck with its extent
it seemed to her at last that she would do well to take a book formerly when heavy hearted she had been able with the help of some well chosen volume to transfer the seat of consciousness to the organ of pure reason
of late it was not to be denied literature had seemed a fading light and even after she had reminded herself that her uncles library was provided with a complete set of those authors which no gentlemans collection should be without
she sat motionless and empty handed her eyes bent on the cool green turf of the lawn her meditations were presently interrupted by the arrival of a servant who handed her a letter the letter bore the london postmark
you will remember that when you gave me my dismissal at albany three months ago i did not accept it i protested against it you in fact appeared to accept my protest and to admit that i had the right on my side
i had come to see you with the hope that you would let me bring you over to my conviction my reasons for entertaining this hope had been of the best but you disappointed it i found you changed
arbitrary or capricious therefore it is that i believe you will let me see you again you told me that im not disagreeable to you and i believe it for i dont see why that should be i shall always think of you
i shall never think of any one else i came to england simply because you are here i couldnt stay at home after you had gone i hated the country because you were not in it if i like this country at present
it is only because it holds you i have been to england before but have never enjoyed it much may i not come and see you for half an hour this at present is the dearest wish of yours faithfully
caspar goodwood isabel read this missive with such deep attention that she had not perceived an approaching tread on the soft grass
had laid before her a pair of alternatives now of course youre completely your own mistress and are as free as the bird on the bough i dont mean you were not so before but youre at present on a different footing
property erects a kind of barrier you can do a great many things if youre rich which would be severely criticised if you were poor you can go and come you can travel alone you can have your own establishment
i mean of course if youll take a companion some decayed gentlewoman with a darned cashmere and dyed hair who paints on velvet you dont think youd like that of course you can do as you please
shed keep people off very well i think
that its a great deal better you should remain with me in spite of there being no obligation its better for several reasons quite apart from your liking it i shouldnt think youd like it but i recommend you to make the sacrifice
she had a great regard for what was usually deemed decent and a young gentlewoman without visible relations had always struck her as a flower without foliage
when she sat in her damp waterproof and sketched the opportunities that europe would offer to a young person of taste this however was in a great measure the girls own fault she had got a glimpse of her aunts experience
and her imagination constantly anticipated the judgements and emotions of a woman who had very little of the same faculty apart from this missus touchett had a great merit she was as honest as a pair of compasses
but was never over inquisitive as regards the territory of her neighbour isabel came at last to have a kind of undemonstrable pity for her there seemed something so dreary in the condition of a person whose nature had as it were
so little surface offered so limited a face to the accretions of human contact nothing tender nothing sympathetic had ever had a chance to fasten upon it
no wind sown blossom no familiar softening moss her offered her passive extent in other words was about that of a knife edge isabel had reason to believe none the less
she was learning to sacrifice consistency to considerations of that inferior order for which the excuse must be found in the particular case it was not to the credit of her absolute rectitude
that she should have gone the longest way round to florence in order to spend a few weeks with her invalid son
that when ralph wished to see her he was at liberty to remember that palazzo crescentini contained a large apartment known as the quarter of the signorino i want to ask you something
isabel said to this young man the day after her arrival at san remo something ive thought more than once of asking you by letter but that ive hesitated on the whole to write about face to face nevertheless
what does it matter my dear isabel whether i knew my father was very obstinate so said the girl you did know yes he told me we even talked it over a little
asked isabel abruptly why as a kind of compliment a compliment on what on your so beautifully existing he liked me too much she presently declared thats a way we all have
if i believed that i should be very unhappy fortunately i dont believe it i want to be treated with justice i want nothing but that very good but you must remember that justice to a lovely being
is after all a florid sort of sentiment im not a lovely being how can you say that at the very moment when im asking such odious questions i must seem to you delicate
you seem to me troubled said ralph i am troubled about what for a moment she answered nothing then she broke out do you think it good for me suddenly to be made so rich
henrietta doesnt oh hang henrietta said ralph coarsely if you ask me im delighted at it is that why your father did it for your amusement i differ with miss stackpole
ralph went on more gravely i think it very good for you to have means isabel looked at him with serious eyes i wonder whether you know whats good for me or whether you care if i know depend upon it i care
dont question your conscience so much it will get out of tune like a strummed piano keep it for great occasions dont try so much to form your character its like trying to pull open a tight tender young rose
live as you like best and your character will take care of itself most things are good for you the exceptions are very rare and a comfortable incomes not one of them ralph paused smiling
isabel had listened quickly youve too much power of thought above all too much conscience ralph added its out of all reason the number of things you think wrong put back your watch diet your fever
its never wrong to do that she had listened eagerly as i say and it was her nature to understand quickly i wonder if you appreciate what you say if you do you take a great responsibility you frighten me a little
but i think im right said ralph persisting in cheer all the same what you say is very true isabel pursued you could say nothing more true im absorbed in myself i look at life too much as a doctors prescription
why indeed should we perpetually be thinking whether things are good for us as if we were patients lying in a hospital why should i be so afraid of not doing right as if it mattered to the world whether i do right or wrong
youre a capital person to advise said ralph you take the wind out of my sails she looked at him as if she had not heard him though she was following out the train of reflexion which he himself had kindled
a large fortune means freedom and im afraid of that its such a fine thing and one should make such a good use of it if one shouldnt one would be ashamed and one must keep thinking its a constant effort
im not sure its not a greater happiness to be powerless for weak people ive no doubt its a greater happiness for weak people the effort not to be contemptible must be great and how do you know im not weak isabel asked
the gate of admirations italy as yet imperfectly seen and felt stretched before her as a land of promise a land in which a love of the beautiful might be comforted by endless knowledge
whenever she strolled upon the shore with her cousin and she was the companion of his daily walk she looked across the sea with longing eyes to where she knew that genoa lay
she was glad to pause however on the edge of this larger adventure there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering it affected her moreover as a peaceful interlude as a hush of the drum and fife in a career which she had little warrant
as yet for regarding as agitated but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by the light of her hopes her fears her fancies her ambitions her predilections
madame merle had predicted to missus touchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been filled by a munificent uncle
grown used to feeling rich the consciousness in question found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about herself and often it was by no means the least agreeable
it took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions she lost herself in a maze of visions the fine things to be done by a rich independent generous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations
were sublime in the mass her fortune therefore became to her mind a part of her better self it gave her importance gave her even to her own imagination a certain ideal beauty
which in spite of increasing distance were still sufficiently salient they were recognisable without difficulty
she could summon back her faith in case of need with an effort but the effort was often painful even when the reality had been pleasant the past was apt to look dead and its revival rather to show the
livid light of a judgement day the girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that she herself lived in the mind of others
she was capable of being wounded by the discovery that she had been forgotten but of all liberties the one she herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget she had not given her last shilling sentimentally speaking
either to caspar goodwood or to lord warburton and yet couldnt but feel them appreciably in debt to her she had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from mister goodwood again but this was not to be for another year and a half
and in that time a great many things might happen she had indeed failed to say to herself that her american suitor might find some other girl more comfortable to woo because though it was certain many other girls would prove so
she had not the smallest belief that this merit would attract him but she reflected that she herself might know the humiliation of change might really for that matter come to the end of the things that were not caspar
a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite breakwater but that day could only come in its order and she couldnt wait for it with folded hands that lord warburton should continue to cherish her image
seemed to her more than a noble humility or an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with she had so definitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a corresponding effort on his own part
would be eminently just this was not as it may seem merely a theory tinged with sarcasm isabel candidly believed that his lordship would in the usual phrase get over his disappointment
he had been deeply affected this she believed and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with
should cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable said isabel and there could be little comfort for lord warburton in the long run in brooding over a self sufficient american girl
who had been but a casual acquaintance she flattered herself that should she hear from one day to another that he had married some young woman of his own country who had done more to deserve him
she should receive the news without a pang even of surprise it would have proved that he believed she was firm which was what she wished to seem to him
before the sittings of the great assembly had come to an end a young statesman destined to play the leading part in the government of the dutch republic during two decades had already made his mark
his readiness and persuasiveness of speech his industry and his gifts at once of swift insight and orderly thoroughness
but the old sores remained open moreover the refusal of the states general to receive the parliamentary envoys the murder of doreslaer and the protection afforded to royalist refugees had been additional causes of resentment
but the english council had not felt strong enough to take action the death of the prince of orange
appeared at first to open out a prospect of friendlier relations between the two neighbouring republics in january sixteen fifty one the great assembly formally recognised the commonwealth
and determined to send back to his old post in london the veteran ambassador joachimi who had been recalled the english government on their part anticipated his return by despatching in march oliver saint john and walter strickland
and saint john and strickland greeted with loud cries of regicides and many abusive epithets remembering the fate of doreslaer were in fear of their lives
on april fourth a conference was opened between the envoys and six commissioners appointed by the states to consider the proposals of the english government for a more strict and intimate alliance and union between the two states the dutch quickly perceived
that what the english really wanted was nothing less than such a binding alliance or rather coalition as would practically merge the lesser state in the greater but the very idea of such a loss of the independence that they had only just won was to the netherlanders unthinkable
the negotiations came to a deadlock
foremost amongst them prince edward son of the queen of bohemia the parliament threatened to recall the envoys but consented that they should remain on the undertaking of the estates of holland to protect them from further attacks and to punish the offenders
new proposals were accordingly made for an offensive and defensive alliance without any suggestion of a union coupled with the condition that both states should bind themselves not to allow the presence within their boundaries of avowed enemies of the other in other words
the expulsion of the members and adherents of the house of stewart including the princess royal and the queen of bohemia with their children
even the estates of holland dared not consider such terms and the states general would have angrily rejected them after some further parleying therefore about fisheries and trade restrictions it was felt that no agreement could be reached
and saint john and strickland returned to england on july thirty first sixteen fifty one their failure created a very bad impression upon the parliament all the old complaints against the dutch were revived and
as they had refused the offer of friendship that had been made to them it was resolved that strong measures should be taken to obtain redress for past grievances and for the protection of english trade interests at the instance of saint john
the famous navigation act was passed by the parliament october ninth sixteen fifty one this act struck a mortal blow at the dutch carrying trade by forbidding the importation of foreign goods into english ports except in english bottoms or in those of the countries which had produced the goods
scarcely less injurious was the prohibition to aliens to fish in british waters and the withdrawal of the rights based on the magnus intercursus for the maintenance of which dutch statesmen had so long and strenuously fought
there was consternation in holland and the states general determined to send a special embassy to london
a man in whose ripe judgment they had confidence to the office of council pensionary
who having been given letters of marque to prey upon french commerce
the english government however met the dutch complaints by raking up the long list of grievances that had stirred up a bitter feeling of popular hatred against the united provinces in england and by demanding reparation
they further demanded that dutch commanders should acknowledge englands sovereignty by striking flag and sail and by firing a salute whenever any of their squadrons met english ships in the narrow seas it was these last two questions
the right of search and the striking of the flag that were to be the real causes of the outbreak of a war that was desired by neither of the two governments but popular feeling and the course of events was too strong for them the news of the seizure of their vessels
not merely by privateers but by an english squadron under ayscue in the west indies had caused intense indignation and alarm in holland and especially in amsterdam pressure was brought to bear on the states general and the admiralties
who in pursuance of economy had reduced the fleet to seventy five ships it was resolved therefore on february twenty second
the council of state on hearing of this began also to make ready for eventualities negotiations were still proceeding between the two countries when martin tromp the victor of the battle of the downs
now lieutenant admiral of holland was sent to sea with fifty ships and instructions to protect dutch merchantmen from interference and to see that the states suffered no affront nothing was actually said about the striking of the flag
it came suddenly through a misunderstanding the dutch admiral while cruising past dover met on may twenty ninth fifteen english ships under blake
tromp declared that he had given orders to strike the flag but that blake again fired before there was time to carry them out be this as it may the two fleets were soon engaged in a regular fight and the english being reinforced tromp withdrew at nightfall
to the french coast having lost two ships great was the anger aroused in england where the dutch were universally regarded as the aggressors in the netherlands where the peace party was strong many were disposed to blame tromp despite his protests
adrian pauw himself left hastily for london john de witt being appointed to act as his deputy during his absence pauws strenuous efforts however to maintain peace were all in vain despite the strong leanings of cromwell towards a peaceful solution
but popular feeling on both sides was now aroused
if humiliating terms were submitted to stiffened their attitude the result was that the envoys left london on june thirtieth sixteen fifty two and war was declared the dutch statesmen who sought to avoid hostilities were right
all the advantages were on the side of their enemies the dutch merchant fleets covered the seas and the welfare of the land depended on commerce the english had little to lose commercially
was superior in almost all other respects the stuarts had devoted great attention to the fleet and would have done more but for lack of means charles much abused ship money was employed by him for the creation of the first english professional navy
it had been largely increased by the parliament after sixteen forty eight and its generals blake penn and ayscue had already acquired much valuable experience in their encounters with the royalist squadron under prince rupert
and in long cruises to the west indies for the purpose of forcing the english colonies to acknowledge parliamentary rule the crews therefore were well trained and the ships were larger stronger and better armed than those of the dutch
the position of england lying as it did athwart the routes by which the dutch merchant fleets must sail was a great advantage even more important was the advantage of having a central control
whereas in the netherlands there were five distinct boards of admiralty to some extent jealous of each other and now lacking the supreme direction of an admiral general the war began by a series of english successes and of dutch misfortunes
early in july sixteen fifty two blake at the head of sixty ships set sail for the north to intercept the dutch baltic commerce and to destroy their fishing fleet off the north of scotland
he left ayscue with a small squadron to guard the mouth of the thames tromp meanwhile had put to sea at the head of nearly a hundred ships ayscue succeeded in intercepting a fleet of dutch merchantmen near calais
all of them being captured or burnt while blake with the main force off the north coast of scotland destroyed the dutch fishing fleet and their convoy after these first blows against the enemys commerce good fortune continued to attend the english
tromp was prevented from following blake by strong northerly winds he then turned upon ayscue whose small force he must have overwhelmed but for a sudden change to a southerly gale the dutch admiral now sailed northwards and july twenty fifth
found the english fleet off the shetlands a violent storm arose from the force of which blake was protected while the dutch vessels were scattered far and wide on the following day out of ninety nine ships tromp could only collect thirty five
and to meet and convoy back the home coming ships
ayscue had previously sailed up channel with forty men of war and five fireships for a similar purpose the two fleets met on august sixteenth and despite his inferiority of force de ruyter forced ayscue to withdraw into plymouth and was able to bring his convoy home to safety
the ill success of tromp though he was in no way to blame for it caused considerable alarm and discontent in holland his enemies of the states party in that province took advantage of it to suspend the gallant old seaman from his command he was an orangist
and as the orange partisans were everywhere clamorously active the admiral was suspect in his place cornelisz witte de with was appointed a capable sailor but disliked in the fleet as much as tromp was beloved de with effected a junction with de ruyter
and with joint forces they attacked blake on october eighth near the shoal known as the kentish knock the english fleet was considerably more powerful than the dutch and the desertion of de with by some twenty ships decided the issue the dutch had to return home with some loss
but they were deceived in thinking that the struggle in the channel was over for the winter the deserters at the kentish knock were punished
full of resentment though he was at the bad treatment he had received tromp was too good a patriot to refuse at the end of november the old admiral at the head of one hundred warships put to sea for the purpose of convoying some four hundred fifty merchantmen through the straits
stormy weather compelled him to send the convoy with an escort into shelter but he himself with sixty ships set out to seek the english fleet which lay in the downs after some manoeuvring the two fleets met on december tenth off dungeness
while many english prizes were captured this state of things was however not to last long towards the end of february sixteen fifty three blake put to sea with nearly eighty ships and on the twenty fifth off portland met tromp at the head of a force nearly equal to his own in number
and he had moreover been at sea without replenishment of stores ever since the fight at dungeness while the english had come straight from port the fight
had lasted for two whole days when tromp found that his powder had run out and that on the third day more than half his fleet were unable to continue the struggle but inspiring his subordinates de ruyter evertsen and floriszoon with his own indomitable courage
tromp succeeded by expert seamanship in holding off the enemy and conducting his convoy with small loss into safety
meanwhile both nations had been getting sick of the war the dutch were suffering terribly from the serious interference with their commerce and carrying trade and from the destruction of the important fisheries industry
while the english on their side were shut out from the baltic where the king of denmark as the ally of the united provinces had closed the sound and from the mediterranean where admiral van galen
destroyed a british squadron off leghorn march twenty third in both countries there was a peace party
and was averse to war in the dutch republic the states party especially in holland the chief sufferer by the war was anxious for a cessation of hostilities and it found its leader in the youthful john de witt
had been appointed council pensionary cromwell took pains to let the estates of holland know his favourable feelings towards them by sending over in february a private emissary
thus early did the new council pensionary initiate a form of diplomacy in which he was to prove himself an adept this first effort was not a success the parliament published the letter with the title humble supplication of the states of holland
he induced the states general by a bare majority four provinces to three to send a conciliatory letter the date of which april thirtieth sixteen fifty three coincided with cromwells forcible dissolution of the rump parliament and the assumption by him
with the support of the army of dictatorial powers
and their insistence now on the full satisfaction of all the english demands made a continuation of hostilities inevitable tromp after successfully bringing in two large convoys of merchantmen encountered june twelfth
near the gabbard the english fleet under monk and deane each fleet numbered about one hundred sail but the dutch ships were inferior in size solidity and weight of metal for two days the fight was obstinately and fiercely contested
tromp was obliged to retreat having lost twenty ships he complained bitterly as did his vice admirals de ruyter and de with to the board of admiralty of the inferiority of the vessels of his fleet as compared with those of the adversary
the english now instituted a blockade of the dutch coast which had the effect of reducing to desperate straits a land whose welfare and prosperity depended wholly on commerce amsterdam was ruined in these circumstances direct negotiation was perforce attempted
four envoys were sent representing the three maritime provinces at first it seemed impossible that any common ground of agreement could be found cromwell was obsessed with the idea of a politico religious union between the two republics which would have meant the extinction of dutch independence
una respublica which nothing but sheer conquest and dire necessity would ever induce the dutch people to accept accordingly the war went on though the envoys did not leave london hoping still that some better terms might be offered
but in order to gain breathing space for the efforts of the negotiators one thing was essential the breaking of the blockade the admiralties made a supreme effort to refit and reinforce their fleet but it lay in two portions eighty five sail under tromp in the maas
monk with about one hundred ships lay between them to prevent their junction on august fourth tromp sailed out and after a rearguard action off katwijk out manoeuvred the english commander and joined de with he now turned and with superior numbers attacked monk off scheveningen
the old hero fell mortally wounded at the very beginning of what proved to be an unequal fight
the states though much perplexed to find a successor to martin tromp were so far from being discouraged that great energy was shown in reorganising the fleet
meanwhile negotiations had been slowly dragging on the accession of cromwell to supreme power in december sixteen fifty three with the title of lord protector
for the new ruler of england had always professed himself an opponent of the war which had shattered his fantastic dream of a union between the two republics many conferences took place but the protectors attitude and intentions were ambiguous and difficult to divine
at last cromwell formulated his proposals in twenty seven articles the demands were those of the victor and were severe all the old disputes were to be settled in favour of england an annual sum was to be paid for the right of fishing
compensation to be made for the massacre of amboina and the officials responsible for it punished the number of warships in english waters was to be limited the flag had to be struck when english ships were met and the right of search to be permitted these demands
article twelve stipulated that the prince of orange should not at any time hold any of the offices or dignities which had been held by his ancestors or be appointed to any military command
was perfectly aware that it would be useless to present such proposals to the states general not only would they indignantly reject them but he had not the slightest hope of getting any single province even holland to allow a foreign power to interfere with their internal affairs
and to bid them to treat with harsh ingratitude the infant heir of a family to which the dutch people owed so deep a debt there was nothing for it but to prepare for a vigorous resumption of the war strong efforts were therefore made at de witts instigation
to increase the fleet and secure the active co operation of denmark and france both friendly to the states but cromwell really wanted peace and showed himself ready to yield on certain minor points but he continued to insist on the exclusion of the prince of orange
not till the dutch envoys had demanded their passports did the protector give way so far as to say he would be content to have the exclusion guaranteed by a secret article what followed forms one of the strangest chapters in the history of diplomacy
he was able to reach the private ear of cromwell and to enter into clandestine negotiations with him the council pensionary knew well the hopelessness of any attempt to get the assent of the states general to the proposed exclusion even in a secret article
of the state of public feeling on this point with the result that the protector gave the envoy to understand that he would be satisfied if the estates of holland alone would affirm a declaration that the prince should never be appointed stadholder or captain general whether this concession was offered by cromwell proprio motu
in any case the council pensionary being convinced of the necessity of peace resolved to secure it by playing a very deep and dangerous game not only must the whole affair be kept absolutely from the cognisance of the states general
but also de witt was fully aware that the assent of the estates of holland to the proposed exclusion article could only be obtained with the greatest difficulty he was to prove himself a very past master in the art of diplomatic chicanery and intrigue
the council pensionary first set to work to have the treaty from which the exclusion article had been cut out ratified rapidly by the states general
the estates adjourned for a recess on april twenty first sixteen fifty four on the following day he presented the treaty to the states general
and such was his persuasive skill that he accomplished the unprecedented feat of getting this dilatory body to accept the conditions of peace almost without discussion
the treaty ratified and signed was sent back to london only one article aroused opposition
the so called temperament clause but cromwell had insisted upon it by this article
or commander of military or naval forces
addressed to the estates of holland not at the moment in session
the cleverness and skill now shown by the council pensionary were truly extraordinary a summons was sent out to the estates to meet on april twenty eighth without any reason being assigned the members on assembly were sworn to secrecy
and then the official letter from london was read to them
to the act of exclusion came upon the estates like a thunder bolt the sudden demand caused something like consternation and the members asked to be allowed to consider the matter with their principals before taking so momentous a decision three days were granted
but as it was essential to prevent publicity it was settled that only the burgomasters should be consulted again under oath of secrecy at the meeting on may first
that the act should be placed in his hands within two days after the ratification of the treaty was peremptory and threatening unless he received the act he would consider the treaty as not binding upon him using all his powers of advocacy
de witt succeeded after an angry debate in securing a majority for the act five towns however obstinately refused their assent and claimed that it could not be passed without it but de witt had made up his mind to risk illegality
and overruled their protest the act was declared to have been passed and was on may fifth sent to van beverningh and nieuwpoort with instructions not to deliver it until circumstances compelled them to do so
but for some five weeks the existence of the act was unknown to the states general and during that period
early in june a bribe induced one of de witts clerks to betray the secret to count william frederick the news soon spread and loud was the outcry of the orange partisans and of the two princesses who at once addressed a remonstrance to the states general
all the other provinces strongly protested against the action of the estates of holland and of the council pensionary de witt attempted to defend himself and the estates by vague statements avoiding the main issue but insisting that nothing illegal had been done his efforts were in vain
all the secret instructions they had received from holland and the act of exclusion meanwhile the estates of holland themselves frightened at the clamour which had been aroused began to show signs of defection
they went so far as to pass a vote of thanks to the envoys for not having delivered the act to cromwell de witts position appeared hopeless
his efforts to prevent the resolution of the states general from taking immediate effect proving unavailing he put forward the suggestion that on account of its importance the despatch should be sent to the envoys in cipher
this was agreed to and on june seventh the document was duly forwarded to london by the council pensionary
informing them that the estates of holland assented to the request made by the states general and that they were to send back the secret correspondence and also the act if it were still undelivered the result answered to his expectations
while the clerk was laboriously deciphering the despatch the envoys read between the lines of de witts letter and without a moments delay went to whitehall and placed the act in cromwells hands the states general had thus no alternative between acceptance of the fait accompli
and the risk of a renewal of the war no further action was taken and the protector professed himself satisfied with a guarantee of such doubtful validity it is impossible to withhold admiration from de witts marvellous diplomatic dexterity
and from the skill and courage with which he achieved his end in the face of obstacles and difficulties that seemed insurmountable but for the course of double dealing and chicanery by which he triumphed the only defence that can be offered is that the council pensionary
really believed that peace was an absolute necessity for his country and that peace could only be maintained at the cost of the act of exclusion
there is however every reason to believe that de witt was prompted to take the risks he did by purely patriotic motives and not through spite against the house of orange
not merely by the orange partisans but by popular opinion generally in the united provinces

every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments each of its joys ripens into a new want nature uncontainable flowing forelooking

establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society the natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience
one must not be too old the delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom
and therefore i know i incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the court and parliament of love but from these formidable censors i shall appeal to my seniors
for it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak though it begin with the young yet forsakes not the old or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old
glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women upon the universal heart of all and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames
only it is to be hoped that by patience and the muses aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden
and the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history for each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured
which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment he will shrink and moan alas i know not why but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name
dwell care and canker and fear with thought with the ideal is immortal hilarity the rose of joy round it all the muses sing but grief cleaves to names and persons and the partial interests of to day and yesterday
the strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society what do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment
and what fastens attention in the intercourse of life like any passage betraying affection between two parties perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again but we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion and we are no longer strangers
it is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic the rude village boy teases the girls about the school house door but to day he comes running into the entry and meets one fair child disposing her satchel
he holds her books to help her and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely and was a sacred precinct among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough but one alone distances him
for persons are loves world and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love without being tempted to unsay as treasonable to nature aught derogatory to the social instincts
yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows but here is a strange fact it may seem to many men in revising their experience
that they have no fairer page in their lifes book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances
no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain which created all things anew which was the dawn in him of music poetry and art which made the face of nature radiant with purple light
the morning and the night varied enchantments when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory
when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends though best and purest can give him for the figures the motions
the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water but as plutarch said enamelled in fire and make the study of midnight thou art not gone being gone whereer thou art
thy loving heart in the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love
all other pleasures are not worth its pains and when the day was not long enough but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on
the clouds have faces as he looks on them the trees of the forest the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite yet nature soothes and sympathizes
a midnight bell a passing groan these are the sounds we feed upon behold there in the wood the fine madman he is a palace of sweet sounds and sights he dilates he is twice a man
he walks with arms akimbo he soliloquizes he accosts the grass and the trees he feels the blood of the violet the clover and the lily in his veins and he talks with the brook that wets his foot
the heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse it is a fact often observed that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion who cannot write well under any other circumstances
the like force has the passion over all his nature it expands the sentiment it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart
into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world so only it have the countenance of the beloved object in giving him to another it still more gives him to himself
as you know and as i have given you proof i have the greatest admiration in the world for one whose work for humanity has won such universal recognition i hope that we shall both forget this unhappy morning and that you will give me an opportunity of rendering to you in person
the apologies which are due to you i feel that anything less will neither rehabilitate me in your esteem nor secure for me the remnants of my shattered self respect i am hoping you will dine with me next week and meet a most interesting man george gathercole
to disturb a relationship which i have always hoped would be mutually pleasant if you will allow gathercole who will be unconscious of the part he is playing to act as peacemaker between yourself and myself
i shall feel that his trip which has cost me a large sum of money will not have been wasted i am dear mister meredith yours very sincerely remington kara
kara folded the letter and inserted it in its envelope he rang a bell on his table and the girl who had so filled t x with a sense of awe came from an adjoining room you will see that this is delivered miss holland
a man against whom my favourite weapon would fail she looked at him with interest in her eyes what is your favourite weapon mister kara she asked fear he said
if he expected her to give him any encouragement to proceed he was disappointed probably he required no such encouragement for in the presence of his social inferiors he was somewhat monopolizing cut a mans flesh and it heals he said
whip a man and the memory of it passes frighten him fill him with a sense of foreboding and apprehension and let him believe that something dreadful is going to happen either to himself or to someone he loves better the latter
and you will hurt him beyond forgetfulness fear is a tyrant and a despot more terrible than the rack more potent than the stake fear is many eyed and sees horrors where normal vision only sees the ridiculous
is that your creed she asked quietly part of it miss holland he smiled she played idly with the letter she held in her hand balancing it on the edge of the desk her eyes downcast
what would justify the use of such an awful weapon she asked it is amply justified to secure an end he said blandly for example i want something i cannot obtain that something through the ordinary channel or by the employment of ordinary means
if i can buy it well and good if i can buy those who can use their influence to secure this thing for me so much the better if i can obtain it by any merit i possess i utilize that merit
providing always that i can secure my object in the time otherwise he shrugged his shoulders i see she said nodding her head quickly i suppose that is how blackmailers feel he frowned
that is a word i never use nor do i like to hear it employed he said blackmail suggests to me a vulgar attempt to obtain money
and according to your argument they are also justified it is a matter of plane he said airily viewed from my standpoint they are sordid criminals the sort of person that t x meets i presume in the course of his daily work
t x he went on somewhat oracularly is a man for whom i have a great deal of respect you will probably meet him again for he will find an opportunity of asking you a few questions about myself i need hardly tell you
he lifted his shoulders with a deprecating smile i shall certainly not discuss your business with any person said the girl coldly i am paying you three pounds a week i think he said
i intend increasing that to five pounds because you suit me most admirably thank you said the girl quietly but i am already being paid quite sufficient she left him a little astonished and not a little ruffled
to refuse the favours of remington kara was by him regarded as something of an affront
he rang the bell this time for his valet fisher he said i am expecting a visit from a gentleman named gathercole a one armed gentleman whom you must look after if he comes
detain him on some pretext or other because he is rather difficult to get hold of and i want to see him
he will probably be interested if you take him into the library very good sir said the urbane fisher will you change before you go out kara shook his head i think i will go as i am he said get me my fur coat this beastly cold kills me
he shivered as he glanced into the bleak street keep my fire going put all my private letters in my bedroom and see that miss holland has her lunch fisher followed him to his car wrapped the fur rug about his legs
closed the door carefully and returned to the house
that he should return to karas study and set the papers in order was natural and proper that he should conduct a rapid examination of all the drawers in karas desk might be excused on the score of diligence since he was to some extent in the confidence of his employer
kara was given to making friends of his servants up to a point in his more generous moments he would address his bodyguard as fred and on more occasions than one and for no apparent reason had tipped his servant over and above his salary
mister fred fisher found little to reward him for his search until he came upon karas cheque book which told him that on the previous day the greek had drawn six thousand pounds in cash from the bank
this interested him mightily and he replaced the cheque book with the tightened lips and the fixed gaze of a man who was thinking rapidly he paid a visit to the library where the secretary was engaged in making copies of karas correspondence
answering letters appealing for charitable donations and in the hack words which fall to the secretaries of the great he replenished the fire asked deferentially for any instructions and returned again to his quest
this time he made the bedroom the scene of his investigations the safe he did not attempt to touch but there was a small bureau in which kara would have placed his private correspondence of the morning this however yielded no result
rum cove said fisher he paused for a moment before the closed door of the room and smilingly surveyed the great steel latch which spanned the door and fitted into an iron socket securely screwed to the framework he lifted it gingerly
there was a little knob for the purpose and let it fall gently into the socket which had been made to receive it on the door itself rum cove he said again and lifting the latch to the hook which held it up left the room closing the door softly behind him
he walked down the corridor with a meditative frown and began to descend the stairs to the hall he was less than half way down when the one maid of karas household came up to meet him theres a gentleman who wants to see mister kara she said here is his card
fisher took the card from the salver and read mister george gathercole junior travellers club ill see this gentleman he said with a sudden brisk interest he found the visitor standing in the hall
he was a man who would have attracted attention if only from the somewhat eccentric nature of his dress and his unkempt appearance he was dressed in a well worn overcoat of a somewhat pronounced check he had a top hat glossy and obviously new at the back of his head
a pair of pince nez sat crookedly on his nose and two fat volumes under his arm completed the picture fisher who was an observer of some discernment noticed under the overcoat a creased blue suit large black boots
and a pair of pearl studs the newcomer glared round at the valet take these he ordered peremptorily pointing to the books under his arm fisher hastened to obey and noted with some wonder that the visitor did not attempt to assist him
either by loosening his hold of the volumes or raising his hand accidentally the valets hand pressed against the others sleeve and he received a shock for the forearm was clearly an artificial one it was against a wooden surface beneath the sleeve that his knuckles struck
and this view of the strangers infirmity was confirmed when the other reached round with his right hand took hold of the gloved left hand and thrust it into the pocket of his overcoat where is kara growled the stranger
he told me he would be in at six oclock at the latest six oclock ye gods stormed the man impatiently what dog am i that i should wait till six
six oclock eh you will tell mister kara that i called give me those books but i assure you sir stammered fisher give me those books roared the other
deftly he lifted his left hand from the pocket crooked the elbow by some quick manipulation and thrust the books which the valet most reluctantly handed to him back to the place from whence he had taken them tell mister kara i will call at my own time
good morning to you if you would only wait sir pleaded the agonized fisher wait be hanged snarled the other ive waited three years i tell you tell mister kara to expect me when he sees me he went out and most unnecessarily banged the door behind him
fisher went back to the library the girl was sealing up some letters as he entered and looked up i am afraid miss holland ive got myself into very serious trouble what is that fisher asked the girl
mister gathercole said the girl quickly fisher nodded yes miss i couldnt get him to stay though she pursed her lips thoughtfully mister kara will be very cross but i dont see how you can help it i wish you had called me
at six oclock miss the man replied there is rather an important letter here which has to be delivered shall i ring up for a messenger no i dont think that would be advisable you had better take it yourself
she handed him the letter and he read without a droop of eyelid the superscription
special service department scotland yard whitehall he put it carefully in his pocket and went from the room to change large as the house was kara did not employ a regular staff of servants a maid and a valet comprised the whole of the indoor staff
the only other person in the house beside the girl was the middle aged domestic who was parlour maid serving maid and housekeeper in one miss holland sat at her desk to all appearance reading over the letters she had typed that afternoon
but her mind was very far from the correspondence before her she heard the soft thud of the front door closing and rising she crossed the room rapidly and looked down through the window to the street she watched fisher until he was out of sight
the maid who was also cook arose up as the girl entered its a sight for sore eyes to see you in my kitchen miss she smiled im afraid youre rather lonely missus beale said the girl sympathetically lonely miss cried the maid
i fairly get the creeps sitting here hour after hour its that door that gives me the hump she pointed to the far end of the kitchen to a soiled looking door of unpainted wood thats mister karas wine cellar nobodys been in it but him
i know he goes in sometimes because i tried a dodge that my brother whos a policeman taught me i stretched a bit of white cotton across it an it was broke the next morning mister kara keeps some of his private papers in there said the girl quietly he has told me so himself
said the woman doubtfully i wish hed brick it up the same as he has the lower cellar i get the horrors sittin here at night expectin the door to open an the ghost of the mad lord to come out him that was killed in africa miss holland laughed i want you to go out now she said
the girl ascended to the upper floor again she watched from the window the disappearing figure once out of sight miss holland went to work with a remarkable deliberation and thoroughness from her bag she produced a small purse and opened it
in that case was a new steel key
in two seconds it was open and she was examining its contents it was a large safe of the usual type there were four steel drawers fitted at the back and at the bottom of the strong box
an examination of the first drawer did not produce all that she had expected she returned the papers to the drawer pushed it to and locked it she gave her attention to the second drawer her hand shook a little as she pulled it open
it was a square case covered in red morocco leather she inserted her shaking hand and took it out with a triumphant little cry at last she said aloud and then a hand grasped her wrist and in a panic she turned to meet the smiling face
chapter twelve kara lay back on his down pillows with a sneer on his face and his brain very busy what started the train of thought he did not know but at that moment his mind was very far away
it carried him back a dozen years to a dirty little peasants cabin on the hillside outside durazzo to the livid face of a young albanian chief who had lost at karas whim all that life held for a man
to the hateful eyes of the girls father who stood with folded arms glaring down at the bound and manacled figure on the floor to the smoke stained rafters of this peasant cottage and the dancing shadows on the roof
to that terrible hour of waiting when he sat bound to a post with a candle flickering and spluttering lower and lower to the little heap of gunpowder that would start the trail toward the clumsy infernal machine under his chair
he remembered the day well because it was candlemas day and this was the anniversary he remembered other things more pleasant
he remembered with a savage joy the spectacle of his would be assassins twitching and struggling on the gallows at pezara and
had t x returned he slipped from the bed and went to the door opened it slightly and listened t x with a search warrant might be a source of panic especially if he shrugged his shoulders he had satisfied t x and allayed his suspicions
kara breathed a sigh of relief and his face was wreathed in smiles why of course tell him to come up ask him if he minds seeing me in my room i told him you were in bed sir and he used shocking language said fisher kara laughed send him up he said
yes sir said the servant such an instruction was remarkably pleasing to him there was much that he had to do and that nights freedom would assist him materially perhaps kara hesitated perhaps you had better wait until eleven oclock
bring me up some sandwiches and a large glass of milk or better still place them on a plate in the hall very good sir said the man and withdrew down below that grotesque figure with his shiny hat and his ragged beard was walking up and down the tesselated hallway
muttering to himself and staring at the various objects in the hall with a certain amused antagonism mister kara will see you sir said fisher oh said the other glaring at the unoffending fisher thats very good of him
yes sir said fisher look here the man thrust out his face do you see those grey hairs in my beard the embarrassed fisher grinned is it grey challenged the visitor with a roar
yes sir said the valet hastily is it real grey insisted the visitor pull one out and see the startled fisher drew back with an apologetic smile i couldnt think of doing a thing like that sir oh you couldnt sneered the visitor
then lead on fisher showed the way up the stairs this time the traveller carried no books his left arm hung limply by his side and fisher privately gathered that the hand had got loose from the detaining pocket without its owner being aware of the fact
he pushed open the door and announced mister gathercole and kara came forward with a smile to meet his agent who with top hat still on the top of his head and his overcoat dangling about his heels must have made a remarkable picture
fisher closed the door behind them and returned to his duties in the hall below ten minutes later he heard the door opened and the booming voice of the stranger came down to him fisher went up the stairs to meet him and found him addressing the occupant of the room in his own eccentric fashion
no more patagonia he roared no more tierra del fuego he paused certainly he replied to some question but not patagonia he paused again
and fisher standing at the foot of the stairs wondered what had occurred to make the visitor so genial i suppose your cheque will be honoured all right asked the visitor sardonically and then burst into a little chuckle of laughter as he carefully closed the door
damn all greeks he said jovially and fisher could do no more than smile reproachfully the smile being his very own the reproach being on behalf of the master who paid him the traveller touched the other on the chest with his right hand never trust a greek he said
always get your money in advance is that clear to you yes sir said fisher but i think you will always find that mister kara is always most generous about money dont you believe it dont you believe it my poor man said the other you
at that moment there came from karas room a faint clang whats that asked the visitor a little startled mister karas put down his steel latch said fisher with a smile which means that he is not to be disturbed until he looked at his watch
until eleven oclock at any rate hes a funk snapped the other a beastly funk he stamped down the stairs as though testing the weight of every tread opened the front door without assistance slammed it behind him and disappeared into the night
as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it but in fact the british public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to miss isabel archer whose fortune had dropped her as her cousin said into the dullest house in england
her gouty uncle received very little company and missus touchett not having cultivated relations with her husbands neighbours was not warranted in expecting visits from them she had however a peculiar taste she liked to receive cards
for what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard she flattered herself that she was a very just woman
and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing she had played no social part as mistress of gardencourt and it was not to be supposed that in the surrounding country a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings
but it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure really very gratuitous to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husbands adopted country
isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the british constitution against her aunt
isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness
she was very critical herself it was incidental to her age her sex and her nationality but she was very sentimental as well and there was something in missus touchetts dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing now whats your point of view
she asked of her aunt when you criticise everything here you should have a point of view yours doesnt seem to be american you thought everything over there so disagreeable when i criticise i have mine its thoroughly american
there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them you may say that doesnt make them very numerous american never in the world thats shockingly narrow my point of view thank god is personal
isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging but it would not have sounded well for her to say so
would savour of immodesty even of arrogance
with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance her cousin used as the phrase is to chaff her
he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred
of laughing at all things beginning with himself such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father for the rest he exercised his wit indifferently upon his fathers son this gentlemans weak lungs
his useless life his fantastic mother
his adopted and his native country his charming new found cousin i keep a band of music in my ante room he said once to her it has orders to play without stopping it renders me two excellent services
it keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments and it makes the world think that dancings going on within
the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling
and enter the private apartments it mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order it was but half hospitality to let her remain outside
it must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self defence for her cousin amused himself with calling her columbia and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched he drew a caricature of her
in the folds of the national banner isabels chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow minded what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so but she nevertheless
she would be as american as it pleased him to regard her and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation she defended england against his mother but when ralph sang its praises on purpose as she said to work her up
she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points in fact the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an october pear
and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousins chaff
if her good humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill used but because she suddenly felt sorry for ralph it seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said
i dont know whats the matter with you she observed to him once but i suspect youre a great humbug thats your privilege ralph answered who had not been used to being so crudely addressed i dont know what you care for
i dont think you care for anything you dont really care for england when you praise it you dont care for america even when you pretend to abuse it i care for nothing but you dear cousin said ralph if i could believe
even that i should be very glad ah well i should hope so the young man exclaimed isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth he thought a great deal about her she was constantly present to his mind
at a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival which promised nothing and was an open handed gift of fate had refreshed and quickened them given them wings and something to fly for
poor ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy his outlook habitually sombre lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud
the old man had been gravely ill in the spring and the doctors had whispered to ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with just now he appeared disburdened of pain but ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy
who was waiting to take him off his guard if the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him that his own name would be the first grimly called
the father and son had been close companions and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man who had always and tacitly counted upon his elders help in making the best of a poor business
at the prospect of losing his great motive ralph lost indeed his one inspiration
but without the encouragement of his fathers society he should barely have patience to await his own turn he had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets
he bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that of the two the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy
which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first but of the two triumphs that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which with all abatements he enjoyed
he wondered whether he were harbouring love for this spontaneous young woman from albany but he judged that on the whole he was not after he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this and every day he felt a little more sure
lord warburton had been right about her she was a really interesting little figure ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon and then he said it was only another proof of his friends high abilities
which he had always greatly admired if his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order a character like that he said to himself
a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature its finer than the finest work of art than a greek bas relief
than a gothic cathedral its very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it i had never been more blue more bored than for a week before she came i had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen
a greek bas relief to stick over my chimney piece the key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand and im told to walk in and admire my poor boy youve been sadly ungrateful
and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again the sentiment of these reflexions was very just
his cousin was a very brilliant girl
but she needed the knowing and his attitude with regard to her though it was contemplative and critical was not judicial he surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly
isabels originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own whenever she executes them said ralph may i be there to see it devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place
and his wifes position was that of rather a grim visitor so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed he was not a great walker but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin
a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in isabels somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate and in the long afternoons of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness
they took a boat on the river the dear little river as isabel called it where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape or drove over the country in a phaeton a low capacious thick wheeled phaeton
but which he had now ceased to enjoy isabel enjoyed it largely and handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as knowing was never weary of driving her uncles capital horses through winding lanes and byways
full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find past cottages thatched and timbered past ale houses latticed and sanded past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks
between hedgerows made thick by midsummer when they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn
but the two for the most part sat silent the old man with his head back and his eyes closed his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles
one day however a visitor had arrived the two young persons after spending an hour on the river strolled back to the house and perceived lord warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation
of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable with
he had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked as the father and son often invited him to do for a dinner and a lodging isabel seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival had discovered in this brief space that she liked him
he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times she had hoped she should see him again hoped too that she should see a few others gardencourt was not dull
the place itself was sovereign her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather and ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered her idea of cousins having tended to gloom then
her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view but isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad
had been that she should see a great many people when ralph said to her as he had done several times i wonder you find this endurable you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends
though you would never suppose it when he offered to invite what he called a lot of people and make her acquainted with english society she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray
little however for the present had come of his offers and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help
isabel had spoken to him very often about specimens it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary she had given him to understand that she wished to see english society illustrated by eminent cases
well now theres a specimen he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised lord warburton a specimen of what asked the girl a specimen of an english gentleman do you mean theyre all like him
oh no theyre not all like him
said isabel because im sure hes nice
the fortunate lord warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well but i neednt ask that he said since youve been handling the oars ive been rowing a little isabel answered but how should you know it
oh i know he doesnt row hes too lazy said his lordship indicating ralph touchett with a laugh he has a good excuse for his laziness isabel rejoined lowering her voice a little ah he has a good excuse for everything
cried lord warburton still with his sonorous mirth my excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well said ralph she does everything well she touches nothing that she doesnt adorn
it makes one want to be touched miss archer lord warburton declared
who if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled
had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof lord warburton not only spent the night at gardencourt but he was persuaded to remain over the second day and when the second day was ended
he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow during this period he addressed many of his remarks to isabel who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace she found herself liking him extremely
the first impression he had made on her had had weight but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him though quite without luridity as a hero of romance
with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities its very nice to know two such charming people as those she said meaning by those her cousin and her cousins friend it must be added moreover
that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good humour to the test
but his wife remained in the drawing room with the other members of the party she prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour and then rising observed to isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good night isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed
the occasion wore to her sense a festive character and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early so without further thought she replied very simply need i go dear aunt ill come up in half an hour
its impossible i should wait for you missus touchett answered
ralph will light my candle isabel gaily engaged ill light your candle do let me light your candle miss archer
only i beg it shall not be before midnight
and transferred them coldly to her niece
youre not youre not at your blest albany my dear isabel rose blushing i wish i were she said oh i say mother ralph broke out
i must take it as i find it cant i stay with my own cousin isabel enquired im not aware that lord warburton is your cousin perhaps i had better go to bed the visitor suggested that will arrange it
missus touchett gave a little look of despair and sat down again
ralph meanwhile handed isabel her candlestick he had been watching her it had seemed to him her temper was involved an accident that might be interesting but if he had expected anything of a flare he was disappointed for the girl simply laughed a little
nodded good night and withdrew accompanied by her aunt for himself he was annoyed at his mother though he thought she was right above stairs the two ladies separated at missus touchetts door isabel had said nothing on her way up
isabel considered im not vexed but im surprised and a good deal mystified wasnt it proper i should remain in the drawing room not in the least young girls here in decent houses
dont sit alone with the gentlemen late at night you were very right to tell me then said isabel i dont understand it but im very glad to know it i shall always tell you her aunt answered whenever i see you taking what seems to me too much liberty
yes i think im very fond of them but i always want to know the things one shouldnt do so as to do them asked her aunt
and a girl called bellah postik they were cousins and as their mothers were great friends and constantly in and out of each others houses they had often been laid in the same cradle and had played and fought over their games when they are grown up they will marry said the mothers
and soon they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their lots
i would rent a bit of ground from the master and then we could be married yes answered bellah with a deep sigh but we live in such hard times and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again we shall have long to wait
that is quite clear replied houarn turning away to his work whenever they met they repeated their grievances and at length houarns patience was exhausted and one morning he came to bellah and told her that he was going away to seek his fortune
the girl was very unhappy as she listened to this and felt sorry that she had not tried to make the best of things she implored houarn not to leave her but he would listen to nothing the birds he said continue flying until they reach a field of corn and
like them i shall seek till i get what i want that is money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten and if you love me bellah you wont attempt to hinder a plan which will hasten our marriage the girl saw it was useless to say more so she answered sadly
well go then since you must but first i will divide with you all that my parents left me and going to her room she opened a small chest and took from it a bell a knife and a little stick this bell she said can be heard at any distance however far
but it only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger the knife frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them while the stick will carry you wherever you want to go i will give you the knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards
and the bell to tell me of your perils the stick i shall keep for myself so that i can fly to you if ever you have need of me then they cried for a little on each others necks and houarn started for the mountains but in those days as in these beggars abounded
and through every village he passed they followed houarn in crowds mistaking him for a gentleman because there were no holes in his clothes there is no fortune to be made here he thought to himself it is a place for spending and not earning i see i must go further
and he walked on to pont aven a pretty little town built on the bank of a river he was sitting on a bench outside an inn
and the men answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake
and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his life in such a foolish manner but he only laughed
but the men did not know how this was to be done and shaking their heads over his obstinacy left him to his fate
the island was large and lying almost across it was a lake with a narrow opening to the sea houarn paid the boatman and sent him away and then proceeded to walk round the lake
as soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise he prepared to jump into the lake and swim to shore but the bird had guessed his intentions and plunged beneath the water
the pink and white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace while her long black hair was intertwined with strings of coral and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea at the sight of her houarn stopped dazzled by her beauty
my name is houarn he answered
and she beckoned him to follow her into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls while down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds
came from shipwrecked vessels and were brought to her palace by a magic current of water i do not wonder exclaimed houarn who now felt quite at home do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you the rich are always envied
the young man gazed at her in surprise could any one so rich and so beautiful really wish to be his wife he looked at her again and bellah was forgotten as he answered a man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer i can only accept it with joy
when it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all into a golden pot
but it did not sound the least like that to houarn there it is again he said after a short pause
jump she replied but soon the noise grew louder and like cries what is it asked houarn beginning to feel uncomfortable just the crickets on the hearth said she and broke into a song which drowned the cries from the pot
but though houarn held his peace he was not as happy as before something seemed to have gone wrong and then he suddenly remembered bellah is it possible i can have forgotten her so soon
and four men stood before him houarn save us we entreat you and save yourself too murmured they not daring to raise their voices
and no sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes as she had done to all our forerunners who are in the fish pond still where you will shortly join them
it was at this very moment that bellah who was skimming the milk in the farm dairy heard the fairy bell tinkle violently at the sound she grew pale for she knew it meant that houarn was in danger
little staff of apple tree over the earth and over the sea up in the air be guide to me everywhere to wander free and immediately the stick became a smart little horse with a rosette at each ear and a feather on his forehead he stood quite still
the swallow is less swift than the wind the wind is less swift than the lightning but you my horse if you love me must be swifter than them all for there is a part of my heart that suffers the best part of my heart that is in danger and the horse heard her
and galloped like a straw carried along by a tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the leap of the deer
to save you repeated bellah but who are you my little friend
and it is owing to her that i am here but what are you doing in this nest i am sitting on six eggs of stone and i shall not be set free till they are hatched
when you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the net of steel that hangs from her waist and shut her up in it for ever but where am i to find a young mans clothes asked she i will show you he replied
and the fourth an iron without waiting for orders they sat down in the nest and crossing their legs comfortably began to prepare the suit of clothes for bellah with one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat
and with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat which conducted her to the palace of shells the groach seemed overjoyed to see her and told her that never before had she beheld such a handsome young man
very soon she led her visitor into the great hall where wine and fruit were always waiting and on the table lay the magic knife left there by houarn
and to the pond which contained the fish their sides shining with a thousand different colours
and turning rapidly flung it over the witchs head become in body what you are in soul cried she and in an instant the lovely fairy of the sea was a toad horrible to look upon she struggled hard to tear the net asunder but it was no use
her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her his little paws crossed over his little heart bellah felt as if fingers were tightening round her throat but she managed to cry is this you my houarn is this you it is i croaked the little frog
in a car drawn by six cockchafers which once had been the six stone eggs here i am he exclaimed you have broken the spell that held me and now come and get your reward and dismounting from his chariot he led them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels
and shoes with silver buckles the women were all filled with envy but little cared barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone elses and that she had more partners than any other girl
and what was worse often made fun of him with the rest
one evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields and stopped at a little lake on the way home to let them drink he was tired with a long days work and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the animals waiting till they had done and thinking all the while of barbaik
when a voice came out of the gorse close by
it is i the brownie of the lake replied the voice but where are you inquired jegu look close and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog i can take he added proudly any shape i choose
and even which is much harder be invisible if i want to then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear replied jegu certainly if you wish and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses and changed into a little dwarf all dressed in green
at first under different animal shapes since that time partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves we have continued to transform ourselves and it was in this way that i got to know you how exclaimed jegu filled with astonishment
but how are you going to do it exclaimed jegu wonderingly that is my affair perhaps i may tell you later meanwhile you just eat and sleep and dont worry yourself about anything
jegu declared that nothing could be easier and then taking off his hat he thanked the dwarf heartily and led his horses back to the farm next morning was a holiday and barbaik was awake earlier than usual
as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off she went first to the cow house which it was her duty to keep clean but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down
the racks filled with hay the cows milked and the pails standing neatly in a row
and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help to be sure jegu only replied roughly that he didnt know what she was talking about but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else
indeed barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied if the wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her complexion should be spoilt she need only to run down to the spring close by and say softly i should like my churns to be full
and my wet linen to be stretched on the hedge to dry and she need never give another thought to the matter if she found the rye bread too hard to bake or the oven taking too long to heat she just murmured i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box
why am i not already back from morlaix with my milk pot empty my butter bowl inside it a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate and the money i have gained in my apron pocket and in the morning when she got up lo and behold
and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron and she believed that all this was owing to jegu and she could no longer do without him even in her thoughts when things had reached this pass the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him
and this time the girl did not turn rudely away but listened patiently to the end
and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time just like a young lady and as for the rest of the day
she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them
barbaik was furious
her heart was filled with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease and pleasure but when she looked at jegu and beheld his red face squinting eyes and untidy hair her anger was doubled
while now i can receive no presents except from my husband i can never dance except with my husband oh you wretched dwarf i will never never forgive you in spite of her fierce words no one knew better than barbaik how to put her pride in her pocket when it suited her
and after receiving an invitation to a wedding she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride there to her great joy he consented bidding her set out for the city of the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted
she had hardly spoken when the horse appeared and mounting on his back she started for the village where the wedding was to be held at first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work which she hated that she noticed nothing
but very soon it struck her as odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as they looked at her horse at length she caught some words uttered by one man to another why the farmers wife has sold her horses tail and turned in her saddle
but it was of no use he declined to move out of a walk
so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn and whether he would allow them to dance there of course jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie and he ordered barbaik to spread her best table cloths in the barn
when all was ready the dwarfs in new green suits came bustling in very happy and merry and took their seats at the table but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry and ran away screaming for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet and all their poor little toes were burnt
you wont forget that in a hurry she said smiling grimly to herself but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water which they poured on the fire then they joined hands and danced round it singing wicked traitress
the wedding shuts one gate and opens another the longings and dreamings of courtship are at an end the supreme intimacy of life begins as john and mary move away from the altar pronounced man and wife they know they are starting a great adventure
his beaming face masks a stiff determination to keep his bride happy in spite of any worldly obstacles her radiance hides a solemn inward vow to do everything humanly possible to make smooth the way of their life together they are right
unless they are very different from most people this new joint enterprise is going to mean more to each of them than anything else ever can before them is a clear road not to happiness as they may believe but to the opportunity for gaining happiness
when one has received the promise of something greatly desired but must wait awhile before its delivery the happiness of the waiting period is characterized by the absence of a critical spirit and therefore is apt to be thought of as an experience of pure delight
but the first days of marriage bring out a different set of feelings those that come when one has definitely obtained possession of anything that before was only promised at first the emotions seem to stand still this is the long coveted moment then one begins to appraise
is the object of ones wishes as desirable as one had expected because reality rarely measures up to imagination the first answer is almost bound to be no this is not what i expected and the first emotion tends to be disappointment
regardless of hazy but optimistic expectations and the object possessed will more than likely turn out to be better than although different from what the imagination pictured knowing that a fleeting sense of disappointment is not peculiar to ones own marriage but likely to occur in all
roughly both the helps and the hindrances to married happiness can be lumped under one word personalities temperament mannerisms tastes all that is implied in the distinct individuality of each person make up the chief source of the advantages
and disadvantages with which the couple enter marriage these traits cannot be changed overnight nor is it necessary or at all wise that they should be john attracts mary and she appeals to him because the personality of each one is what it is
love has grown up between the two as a result of this personality attraction and love is the motive that will make both try to keep open the pathway to marriage success but love is not a finished product that once it comes can forever after be trusted to keep its strength
like everything else that is alive it must be kept growing through exercise or it wastes away love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving but it does not give the direction that comes from understanding and cooperation
this is what they must guard against while love is still the moving force of their lives they must study the problems that are due to come to wait until they are beset by them is to beg for trouble
in order to cope with their problems they must realize first that they cannot stumble upon married happiness that they must possess and cultivate a positive will to succeed
here are nine guideposts to help john and mary along their road one the first requirement is the building of a union that is just to both the smaller issues on which this rests are the lively clashes of opposite desires
inevitable in the coming together of any two persons intensified when those two persons are as different as a man and a woman and unavoidable for two committed to a lifetime together in the close quarters of marriage two
compromise will lift these essentially petty decisions of precedence above the level of selfishness decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both not the selfish or narrow wish of either
the choice that brings the larger advantage to the two persons in their common role of marriage partners is the one to be made human judgment being as faulty as it is
in either situation the particular couple involved have to weigh delicately the effect on their joint enterprise of the conflicting courses of action much as mary may crave a child or a car
if each one is hurt at the others inability to join instantly in his or her plans they will need to take pains not to get sidetracked into making a personal contest of the affair trying to win over your partner with a single eye to getting what you want
regardless of its effect on the mate is short sighted in the extreme even if you could care only for personal pleasure that cannot long outlast your spouses displeasure staging a contest or a succession of small contests for the sake of finding out who is boss
builds up a habit of fighting that may lead to a bitter end it is useless to discover who can win in any particular skirmish what is important is to learn whether one of you is set on being head of the house if your spouse craves that distinction by all means hand it over without delay
it is an empty honor for the one who bends but does not break will readily develop the fine art of influencing the headstrong one because it is part of the traditional feminine character to enjoy giving in to the man this tendency must be scrutinized when it appears
no man can afford to be crippled for life by letting his wife swaddle him with solicitude as some mothers spoil their children for their own glorification a womans feeling that she will be emotionally gratified by making a sacrifice does not prove that aside from her momentary pleasure
any individual woman may waver between a craving for self sacrifice and a repugnance to the very thought of it this changeableness can make her feel resentful after she has given in to her husband all this must be taken into account in making decisions
compromise not submission should be the rule if john forges ahead on one count mary must find an acceptable outlet for herself on some other front three
and the effort to do so to please the partner is liable to result in a topheavy hypocrisy a superstructure calculated to impress the observer but built on a shaky foundation of chaos
a chameleon changes color easily to match its environment or temper of the moment but a human beings more lasting change is not so readily made each marriage partner must be proud of the other and let the other continue to be proud of him or her
therefore you have to respect yourself and act as if you did even at home too many couples exploit the sense of let down that marriage brings with it after so long a time husband and wife cease to feel that they must exert themselves for each other in little matters
knowing themselves accepted they lounge mentally mannerly and physically when at home or elsewhere alone together some of this relaxation is a good thing but it is a mistake to let home and spouse degenerate into nothing more than an invitation to be lazy
using the mate for relief as in nagging whining crying or grumbling is taboo if you are tired or irritable you can rest or exercise for restoration as in the days before marriage
and dry up the source of refreshment you are trying to tap fatigue and nervousness expressed breed fatigue and nervousness in a sympathetic audience four too great concentration is to be avoided
even the greatest love stagnates if it is kept out of the main current of life to care only for each other is selfishness for two only one step removed from self centered engrossment
this is why the unique value of children is their service as an entering wedge in the close grown love of husband and wife a wedge that widens and holds forever wider the unity of love it has penetrated other responsibilities other interests may serve a similar purpose
though more easily dislodged and seldom striking so deep friends old and new have a function in relieving the overclose concern of one marriage partner with the other if they are to play their full part in preventing overconcentration
common friends are fine but for this purpose there is special need of friends for either spouse who can call forth those sides of his or her nature that are not aroused by the mate
the factor that underlies all the perplexities and most of the contentment of marriage is its unique degree of concentrated intimacy here the supreme testing always comes each means so much to the other
the wife may be alone part of the day and profit by it when john comes home at night he has not had that privilege
or by going out without his wife or by having his friends in when she is not around five the general level of emotion is what counts not the spectacular scaling of peaks staking all on high moments is melodrama with no comic relief
some husbands some wives are artists at achieving and momentarily living up to romantic settings but quickly flop down to the lower levels of decent fairness between the high spots of their sentimental flare ups others cannot utter a poetic phrase
make a romantic gesture or let their eyes show the quick intensity of their tender emotions if they must die for it this difference is one of make up and training not of marriage capacity the couple who are sure of each others steady affection regardless of its expression in romantic interludes
another terrible moment that is due to come may seem even more frightening because it is you who are slipping soon or late you find that some familiar mannerism of your spouse displeases you it may be a slight uncouthness at table
now it vexes you and your vexation terrifies you does this mean that you no longer love your mate as you did you cannot help your change of feeling how then can you hope to keep your affection from disappearing altogether if it has already begun to wane
you remember other people you once thought you loved and wonder panic stricken how you can keep this love from dying as those other loves did this is probably an almost universal experience marking not the beginning of the end of love
maturity brings recognition of human imperfections in the most heroic but also develops the ability to weigh big and little things and to
always it is the unturned page the holds the answer to the question how goes it with this marriage the present is useful only as a foundation stone for the future which is being built up out of many fleeting present moments each quickly lost in the past
seven there can be no narrowing of marriage to mere sex adjustment
and the two persons have to work out a common life that means something to them over and above the pleasure they may take in each others company as a continuing part of this life adjustment sex adjustment can develop into a permanent factor of married happiness
but without the larger adjustment the partial adjustment cannot be made in any fundamental and enduring form in the sex life in marriage as in other parts of the association each partner wins by considering the other before the self
but instead a complete trust in each other one who prides himself or herself on having to be handled with gloves has a great deal of growing up to do in order to be able to be an active partner in the marriage cry babying is no more helpful in marriage than in business or social life
in the healthy marriage this sympathetic response will soon give way to anger which in turn may have the effect of a dash of cold water in the face of the oversensitive one helping him or her to buck up and behave like an adult in the unhealthy marriage sympathy will grow into pity
the marriage partner who is mature will maintain trust in the others good intentions in the face of what might seem to be occasions for hurt feelings a chief advantage of the married estate is its opportunity for frankness why doesnt his wife tell him of that unpleasant mannerism so he can correct it
mary may soon lose courage and relinquish her wifely job of husband improvement or the combination may be reversed frankness must go clothed in tact stiff minded people who are frank only when angry lose their case before they present it
if the expression of anger is to have its proper stimulative effect it has to be administered but rarely and then in small doses more has a paralyzing effect on the recipient
producing a response in kind that takes away the ability to think of anything except retaliation nine willingness to grow is the most necessary factor for success marriage is a life program of going on together that requires maturity
as this is an impossibility they are aware of increasing dissatisfaction that does not mean they are unadapted to each other they are afraid to leave the known pleasures of their first youth for the unguessed satisfactions of maturity so they try to stand still
hoping to keep their marriage unchanged in its first stage of promise if both husband and wife accept maturing responsibilities as they come their marriage relationship will keep pace with their own development and will therefore become increasingly satisfying to them

by stander one who is injured in a street fight
missus savareen sat up waiting for her lord until long past midnight but her vigil was in vain lapierre after closing up his inn for the night dropped in according to his promise to see if any news of the absentee had arrived
nothing further could be done in the way of searching for the latter personage until daylight it was getting on pretty well towards morning when missus savareen sought her couch and when she got there her slumber was broken and disturbed she knew not what to think
but she was haunted by a dread that she would never again see her husband alive next morning soon after daylight the whole neighborhood was astir and the country round was carefully searched for any trace of the missing man
squire harrington went down to town and made inquiries at the bank where he ascertained that the story told by savareen to old jonathan perry
was substantially correct this effectually disposed of any possible theory as to jonathan and his wife having mistaken somebody else for savareen squire harrington likewise learned all about the mans doings on the previous afternoon
and was able to fix the time at which he had started for home he had ridden from the door of the peacock at about a quarter to eight
perry professed to have seen and conversed with him there was no longer any room for doubt that interview and conversation had actually taken place at eight oclock on the previous evening and savareen had ridden northward from the gate within five minutes afterwards he could not have proceeded more than a hundred
or at the very outside two hundred yards further or he must inevitably have been encountered by lapierre
but the horse which had disappeared in this unaccountable manner it seemed improbable that two living substances of such bulk should pass out of being and leave no trace behind them they must literally have melted into thin air no they hadnt at least the black mare hadnt
for she was discovered by several members of the searching party a little before noon when found she was quietly cropping the damp herbage at the edge of the cranberry swamp at the rear of squire harringtons farm she was wholly uninjured and had evidently spent the night there
the bit had been removed from her mouth but the bridle hung intact round her neck the saddle however like its owner had disappeared from her back then the men began a systematic search in the interior of the swamp they soon came upon the saddle which had apparently been deliberately unbuckled
and deposited on a dry patch of ground near the edge of the morass a little further in the interior they came upon a mans coat made of dark brown stuff
as belong to savareen it was wet and besmirched with mud and in fact was lying half in and half out of a little puddle of water when it was found then the searchers made sure of finding the body but in this they were disappointed
but found nothing further to reward their search the ground was too soft and marshy to retain any traces of footsteps and the mare and saddle furnished the only evidence that the object of their quest had been in the neighborhood of the swamp and of course this evidence was of the most vague and inconclusive character
then the party proceeded in a body to the missing mans house here another surprise awaited them the coat was at once recognised by missus savareen as belonging to her husband but it was not the coat worn by him at the time of his disappearance of this there was no doubt whatever
in fact he had not worn it for more than a week previously his wife distinctly remembered having folded and laid it away in the top of a large trunk on the saturday of the week before last since which time she had never set eyes on it here was a deepening of the mystery
the search was kept up without intermission for several days nearly all of the farmers in the vicinity taking part in it even to the neglect of the harvest work which demanded their attention squire harrington was especially active and left no stone unturned to unravel the mystery
lapierre gave up all his time to the search and left the royal oak to the care of its landlady the local constabulary bestirred themselves as they had never done before
where a mans body might possibly lie concealed every tract of bush and woodland every barn and out building every hollow and ditch every field and fence corner was explored with careful minuteness even the wells of the district were peered into
from off the face of the earth doctor scott the local coroner held himself in readiness to summon a coroners jury at the shortest notice when all these measures proved unavailing a public meeting of the inhabitants was convened and funds were subscribed to still further prosecute the search
dead or alive or which should throw any light upon his fate hand bills proclaiming this reward and describing the mans personal appearance were exhibited in every bar room and other conspicuous place throughout westchester and the adjacent townships
advertisements setting forth the main facts were inserted in the principal newspapers of toronto hamilton and london
chapter seven the amazing meeting in the shadows of the old courtyard bobby returned to his bed he lay there still shivering beneath the heavy blankets i dont dare he echoed grahams words theres nothing else any one can say
i must decide what to do i must think it over but as always thought brought no release it merely insisted that the case against him was proved at last he had been seen slipping unconsciously from his room and at the same hour
all that remained was to learn how he had accomplished the apparent miracles
the woman at the lake and in the courtyard the movement of the body and the vanishing of the evidence under his hand paredess odd behaviour all became in his mind puzzling details that failed to obscure the chief fact
after this something must be done about paredess detention he hadnt dreamed that his weariness could placate even momentarily such reflections but at last he slept again
he was aroused by the tramping of men around the house and strange harsh voices he raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window it had long been daylight two burly fellows in overalls carrying pick and spade across their shoulders
pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing he turned graham fully dressed stood at the side of the bed those men bobby asked wearily the grave diggers graham answered they are going to work in the old cemetery to prepare a place for silas blackburn
thats why ive come to wake you up the ministers telephoned katherine he will be here before noon do you know its after ten oclock for some time bobby stared through the window at the desolate ragged landscape it was abnormally cold even for the late fall
dull clouds obscured the sun and furnished an illusion of crowding earthward a funereal day the words slipped into his mind he repeated them when your grandfathers buried graham answered softly well all feel happier why bobby asked
it wont lessen the fact of his murder time graham said lessens such facts even for the police bobby glanced at him flushing you mean youve decided to stand by me after what happened last night graham smiled
i slept like a top last night i heard nothing i saw nothing ought i to want you to stand by me bobby said oughtnt i to make a clean breast of it
graham frowned its hard to believe he had any connection with your sleep walking last night yet its as clear as ever that maria and he are up to some game in which you figure he shouldnt be in jail bobby persisted get up graham advised
bathe and have some breakfast then we can decide theres no use talking of the other thing ive forgotten it as far as possible you must bobby sprang upright how can i forget it
have i any right dont graham said ill be with you again to night
when bobby had bathed and dressed he found in spite of his mental turmoil that his sleep had done him good while he breakfasted graham urged him to eat tried to drive from his brain the morbid aftermath of last nights revealing moment
the manager took my advice but marias still missing
he strolled over and handed bobby a number of newspapers wheres robinson bobby asked i saw him in the court a while ago i daresay hes wandering around perhaps watching the men at the grave he learned nothing new last night i was with him at breakfast i gather not
bobby looked up isnt that an automobile coming through the woods he asked maybe rawlins back from smithtown or the minister the car stopped at the entrance of the court they heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell jenkins passed through
his sharp exclamation recalled howellss report which at their direction he had failed to mail had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser bobby started to rise graham moved toward the door then jenkins entered and stood to one side
the former easy mannered uncommunicative foreigner he appeared moreover to have slept pleasantly his eyes showed no weariness his clothing no disarrangement he spoke at once
overcoat ive nearly frozen driving from smithtown before either man could grope for a suitable greeting he faced bobby
fact is bobby i left new york too suddenly
you see i spent a good deal in smithtown yesterday
graham interrupted with a flat demand for an explanation how did you get away
later mister graham there is a hack driver outside who is even more suspicious than you he wants to be paid i asked rawlins to drive me back but he rushed from the courthouse probably to telephone his rotund superior
bobby handed him a banknote he didnt miss grahams meaning glance
pay him will you jenkins thanks
why he should fail to refer to bobbys questions at the moment of his arrest or to the openly expressed enmity of graham only one theory promised to fit at all it was necessary for the panamanian to return to the cedars
compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful tragic house therefore he would crush his justifiable anger
and he had asked for money only a trifling sum yet graham would grasp at the fact to support his earlier suspicion paredess arrival possessed one virtue it diverted bobbys thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma from his inability to chart a course
graham on the other hand was ill at ease
for him yesterdays incident was not so lightly to be passed over eventually his curiosity conquered the words came nevertheless with some difficulty
we took it for granted you would find it necessary to stay in smithtown for a while
simple enough mister graham i telephoned as soon as rawlins got me to the bastille i communicated with the lawyer who represents the company for which i once worked hes a prominent and brilliant man he planned it with some local fellow when i was arraigned at the opening of court this morning
the judge could hold me only as a material witness he fixed a pretty stiff bail but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman and i came back my clothes are here you dont mind bobby that moment in the hall when graham had awakened him urged bobby to reply with a genuine warmth
i dont mind im glad youre out of it
your presence in the private staircase was the last straw you will forgive us carlos
he smoked with a vast contentment thats better nothing to forgive bobby let us call it a misunderstanding graham moved closer
his eyes still smiled but his voice was harder bygones are bygones isnt that so bobby since you wish it bobby said but more important than the knowledge graham desired loomed the old question what was the mans game what held him here
robinson entered the flesh around his eyes was puffier than it had been yesterday worry had increased the incongruous discontent of his round face clearly he had slept little i saw you arrive he said rawlins warned me
but i must say i didnt think youd use your freedom to come to us
since the law wont hold me at your convenience in smithtown i keep myself at your service here if bobby permits it could you ask more bobby shrank from the man with whom he had idled away so much time and money
that fleeting satanic impression of yesterday came back sharper more alarming paredess clear challenge to the district attorney was the measure of his strength his mind was subtler than theirs
his reserve and easy daring mastered them all and always as now he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes to limit his freedom of action bobby didnt care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore
that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain the district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others
and glancing at bobby he asked with a hollow scorn youve no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present if he wishes bobby answered
robinson jerked his head toward the window ive been watching the preparations out there
no hurry bobby answered with a quick intake of breath i suppose not robinson sneered since everybody knows well enough whats in it bobby arose robinson still sneered youll be at the grave as chief mourner
bobby walked from the room he hadnt cared to reply he feared as it was that he had let slip his increased self doubt he put on his coat and hat and left the house the raw cold the years first omen of winter made his blood run quicker
forced into his mind a cleansing stimulation but almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him with his direction a matter of indifference chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house he had walked some distance
the underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained melancholy walls
for once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off of bushes bent and torn of the uncovering through these careless means of an old path
the dull thud of earth falling regularly he paused listening the labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence
in itself beast like and unnatural at last a harsh voice came to bobby its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker deep enough and bobby turned and hurried back along the roughly restored path
as if fleeing from an immaterial thing suddenly quickened with the power of accusation he could picture the fresh oblong excavation in the soil of the family burial ground
there was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery it had received no interment since the death of katherines father like everything about the cedars silas blackburn had delivered it to the swift obliterating fingers of time
if the old man in his selfishness had paused to gaze beyond the inevitable fact of death
he would have guarded with a more precious interest the drapings of his final sleep this necessary task on which bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house as he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal
could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for robinson
a strange man appeared walking from the direction of the house his black clothing relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and bobbys mood
such a figure was appropriate to the cedars
he emerged from the forest and saw again the leisurely weaving of the smoke shroud above the house then his eyes were drawn by the restless movements of a pair of horses
no likely path yet whose crossing is the price of salvation he was glad to see graham leave the court and hurry toward him i was coming to hunt you up bobby the ministers arrived so has doctor groom everythings about ready doctor groom
its natural enough he should be here bobby agreed indifferently they walked slowly back to the house graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead
he asked he ignores what happened yesterday he settles himself in the cedars again i dont know what to think of it bobby answered this morning carlos gave me the creeps
he spoke with pronounced deliberation startling bobby
gave me the creeps too makes me surer than ever that he has an abominably deep purpose in using his wits to hang on here he suggests resources as hard to understand as anything that has happened in the old room youll confess bobby hes had a good deal of influence over you an influence for evil
i wont blame carlos for that bobby muttered he influenced you against your better judgment graham persisted to refuse to leave with me the night of your grandfathers death maria did her share bobby said he broke off looking at graham what are you driving at
ive been asking myself since he came back graham answered if theres any queer power behind his quiet manner maybe he is psychic maybe he can do things we dont understand ive wondered if he had without your knowing it
acquired sufficient influence to direct your body when your mind no longer controlled it its a nasty thought but ive heard of such things you mean carlos may have made me go to the hall last night perhaps sent me to the old room those other times
no i wont believe it ive been weak hartley but not that weak and i tell you i did feel howellss body move under my hand dont misunderstand me graham said gently i must consider every possibility you were excited and imaginative when you went to the old room to take the evidence
might have moved spasmodically i mean
and the disappearance of the evidence bobby defended himself if it had been stolen earlier the coat pocket might have retained its bulging shape
but i was there and you werent
if its so far fetched graham asked quietly why do you revolt from the idea bobby turned on him and why do you fill my mind with such thoughts if you think im guilty say so go tell robinson so
he glanced away while the angry colour left his face he was a little dazed by the realization that he had spoken to graham as he might have done to an enemy as he had spoken to howells in the old bedroom he felt the touch of grahams hand on his shoulder im only working in your service graham said kindly
for groom has brought the ghosts back with him dont make any mistake about that you want the truth dont you yes bobby said even if it does for me
yet that flash of temper had given him courage to face the ordeal a lingering resentment at grahams suggestion lessened the difficulty of his position entering the court he scarcely glanced at the black wagon there were more dark clothed men in the hall rawlins had returned
the panamanian had changed his clothing he too was sombrely dressed and instead of the vivid necktie he had worn from the courthouse a jet black scarf was perfectly arranged beneath his collar he lounged opposite the district attorney
his eyes studying the fire his fingers on the chair arm were restless doctor groom stood at the foot of the stairs talking with the clergyman a stout and unctuous figure
from his thickly bearded face his reddish eyes gleamed forth with a fresh instability the clergyman shook hands with bobby we need not delay your cousin is upstairs he included the company in his circling turn of the head any one who cares to go
bobby forced himself to walk up the staircase facing the first phase of his ordeal he saw that the district attorney realized that too for he sprang from his chair and followed by rawlins started upward the entire company crowded the stairs
graham summoned katherine one of the black clothed men opened the door of silas blackburns room he stepped aside beckoning
bobby went in with the others automatically through the dim light he catalogued remembered objects all intimate to his grandfather each oddly entangled in his mind with his dislike of the old man the iron bed the chest of drawers
scratched and with broken handles the closed colonial desk the miserly rag carpet all seemed mutely asking as bobby did
from the chest of drawers two candles the only light

that you may be able to see this matter of perfumes from our standpoint
he was obliged from time to time to visit his correspondents on business and one day being under the necessity of going a long journey on an affair of importance he took horse and carried with him a wallet containing biscuits and dates
because he had a great desert to pass over where he could procure no sort of provisions he arrived without any accident at the end of his journey and having dispatched his affairs took horse again in order to return home
the fourth day of his journey he was so much incommoded by the heat of the sun and the reflection of that heat from the earth
having alighted he tied his horse to a branch and sitting down by the fountain took some biscuits and dates out of his wallet as he ate his dates he threw the shells carelessly in different directions when he had finished his repast
being a good moosulmaun he washed his hands face and feet and said his prayers before he had finished and while he was yet on his knees he saw a genie white with age
the genie spoke to him in a terrible voice rise that i may kill thee with this cimeter as thou hast killed my son and accompanied these words with a frightful cry
the merchant being as much alarmed at the hideous shape of the monster as at his threatening language answered him trembling alas my good lord of what crime can i be guilty towards you that you should take away my life
demanded the genie did you not take dates out of your wallet
i did all that you say answered the merchant i cannot deny it if it be so resumed the genie i tell thee that thou hast killed my son and in this manner when thou wert throwing the shells about my son was passing by
and thou didst throw one into his eye which killed him therefore i must kill thee
pardon me cried the merchant no pardon exclaimed the genie no mercy is it not just to kill him that has killed another
replied the merchant but certainly i never killed your son and if i have it was unknown to me and i did it innocently i beg you therefore to pardon me and suffer me to live no no returned the genie
persisting in his resolution i must kill thee since thou hast killed my son then taking the merchant by the arm he threw him with his face on the ground and lifted up his cimeter to cut off his head the merchant with tears
protested he was innocent bewailed his wife and children and supplicated the genie in the most moving expressions the genie with his cimeter still lifted up had the patience to hear his unfortunate victims to the end of his lamentations
all this whining said the monster is to no purpose
what exclaimed the merchant can nothing prevail with you will you absolutely take away the life of a poor innocent yes replied the genie i am resolved
as soon as she had spoken these words perceiving it was day and knowing that the sultan rose early in the morning to say his prayers and hold his council scheherazade discontinued her story dear sister said dinarzade
the remainder of it replied scheherazade is more surprising and you will be of this opinion if the sultan will but permit me to live over this day
i will wait till to morrow for i can at any time put her to death when she has concluded her story having thus resolved not to put scheherazade to death that day he rose and went to his prayers and to attend his council
instead of sleeping he spent the night in sighs and groans bewailing the lot of his daughter of whom he believed he should himself shortly be the executioner as with this melancholy prospect before him he dreaded to meet the sultan
he was agreeably surprised when he found the prince entered the council chamber without giving him the fatal orders he expected the sultan according to his custom spent the day in regulating his affairs and when the night had closed in retired with scheherazade
the next morning before day dinarzade failed not to call to her sister my dear sister if you be not asleep i pray you till day break which is very near to go on with the story you began last night
the sultan without waiting for scheherazade to ask his permission bade her proceed with the story of the genie and the merchant upon which scheherazade continued her relation as follows f n
in the original work scheherazade continually breaks off to ask the sultan to spare her life for another day that she may finish the story she is relating as these interruptions considerably interfere with the continued interest of the stories it has been deemed advisable to omit them
for heavens sake hold your hand allow me one word
to bid my wife and children adieu and
that they may not go to law after my death when i have done this i will come back and submit to whatever you shall please to command but said the genie if i grant you the time you ask i doubt you will never return
if you will believe my oath answered the merchant i swear by all that is sacred that i will come and meet you here without fail what time do you require then demanded the genie
i ask a year said the merchant i cannot in less settle my affairs and prepare myself to die without regret but i promise you that this day twelve months i will return under these trees
to put myself into your hands do you take heaven to be witness to this promise said the genie i do answered the merchant and you may rely on my oath upon this the genie left him near the fountain and disappeared
the merchant being recovered from his terror mounted his horse and proceeded on his journey
but grieved on the other when he reflected on his fatal oath when he reached home his wife and children received him with all the demonstrations of perfect joy but he instead of returning their caresses wept so bitterly
that his family apprehended something calamitous had befallen him
we are all overjoyed said she at your return but you alarm us by your lamentations pray tell us the cause of your sorrow alas replied the husband i have but a year to live
he then related what had passed betwixt him and the genie and informed her that he had given him his oath to return at the end of the year to receive death from his hands when they heard this afflicting intelligence they all began to lament in the most distressing manner
the children all in tears made the house resound with their groans and the father not being able to resist the impulse of nature mingled his tears with theirs so that in a word they exhibited the most affecting spectacle possible
on the following morning the merchant applied himself to put his affairs in order and first of all to pay his debts he made presents to his friends gave liberal alms to the poor
he gave her in addition as much as the law would allow him at last the year expired and he was obliged to depart he put his burial clothes in his wallet but when he came to bid his wife and children adieu their grief surpassed description
when however it became necessary for him to tear himself from these dear objects he addressed them in the following terms my dear wife and children i obey the will of heaven in quitting you follow my example
submit with fortitude to this necessity and consider that it is the destiny of man to die having thus spoken he went out of the hearing of the cries of his family and pursuing his journey arrived on the day appointed
an old man leading a hind appeared and drew near him
brother may i ask why you are come into this desert place which is possessed solely by evil spirits and where consequently you cannot be safe from the beautiful trees which are seen here one might indeed suppose the place inhabited
he then seated himself by the merchant and they entered into conversation but i see day said scheherazade and must leave off yet the best of the story is to come the sultan resolving to hear the end of it
suffered her to live that day also the next morning dinarzade made the same request to her sister as before my dear sister said she
but the sultan wishing to learn what followed betwixt the merchant and the genie bade her proceed with that which she did as follows sir while the merchant and the old man who led the hind were conversing
they saw another old man coming towards them followed by two black dogs
the old man with the hind told him the adventure of the merchant and genie with all that had passed between them particularly the merchants oath
they had scarcely begun to converse together when there arrived a third old man leading a mule he addressed himself to the two former and asked why the merchant who sat with them looked so melancholy they told him the reason
which appeared to him so extraordinary
the merchant and the three old men began to lament and fill the air with their cries when the old man who led the hind saw the genie lay hold of the merchant and about to kill him
i will tell you the history of my life and of the hind you see and if you think it more wonderful and surprising than the adventure of the merchant i hope you will pardon the unfortunate man a third of his offence
what is more my wife she was only twelve years of age when i married her so that i may justly say she ought to regard me equally as her father her kinsman and her husband
we lived together twenty years without any children her barrenness did not effect any change in my love i still treated her with much kindness and affection
my desire of having children only induced me to purchase a slave by whom i had a son who was extremely promising my wife being jealous cherished a hatred for both mother and child
but concealed her aversion so well that i knew nothing of it till it was too late mean time my son grew up and was ten years old when i was obliged to undertake a long journey
before i went i recommended to my wife of whom i had no mistrust the slave and her son and prayed her to take care of them during my absence which was to be for a whole year
she however employed that time to satisfy her hatred she applied herself to magic
the wretch carried my son to a desolate place where by her enchantments she changed him into a calf and gave him to my farmer to fatten pretending she had bought him
her enmity did not stop at this abominable action but she likewise changed the slave into a cow and gave her also to my farmer at my return i enquired for the mother and child
your slave said she is dead and as for your son i know not what is become of him i have not seen him this two months i was afflicted at the death of the slave
but as she informed me my son had only disappeared i was in hopes he would shortly return however eight months passed and i heard nothing of him when the festival of the great bairam was to be celebrated
the unfortunate mother of my son i bound her but as i was going to sacrifice her she bellowed piteously and i could perceive tears streaming from her eyes this seemed to me very extraordinary
and finding myself moved with compassion i could not find in my heart to give her a blow but ordered my farmer to get me another my wife who was present was enraged at my tenderness
and resisting an order which disappointed her malice she cried out what are you doing husband sacrifice that cow your farmer has not a finer nor one fitter for the festival out of deference to my wife i came again to the cow
and combating my compassion which suspended the sacrifice was going to give her the fatal blow when the victim redoubling her tears and bellowing disarmed me a second time
i then put the mallet into the farmers hands and desired him to take it and sacrifice her himself for her tears and bellowing pierced my heart the farmer less compassionate than myself sacrificed her
though to she seemed very fat take her yourself said i to him
i did not enquire what he did with the cow but soon after he had taken her away he returned with a fat calf though i knew not the calf was my son yet i could not forbear being moved at the sight of him on his part
as soon as he beheld me he made so great an effort to come near me that he broke his cord
with his head against the ground as if he meant to excite my compassion conjuring me not to be so cruel as to take his life and did as much as was possible for him to signify that he was my son
i was more surprised and affected with this action than with the tears of the cow i felt a tender pity which interested me on his behalf or rather nature did its duty
go said i to the farmer carry home that calf take great care of him and bring me another in his stead immediately as soon as my wife heard me give this order she exclaimed what are you about husband
take my advice sacrifice no other calf but that wife i replied i will not sacrifice him i will spare him and pray do not you oppose me
the wicked woman had no regard to my wishes she hated my son too much to consent that i should save him i tied the poor creature and taking up the fatal knife was going to plunge it into my sons throat
when turning his eyes bathed with tears in a languishing manner towards me he affected me so much that i had not strength to kill him i let the knife fall and told my wife positively
that i would have another calf to sacrifice and not that she used all her endeavours to persuade me to change my resolution but i continued firm
i come said he to communicate to you a piece of intelligence for which i hope you will return me thanks i have a daughter that has some skill in magic yesterday
these two metamorphoses were made by the enchantments of our masters wife who hated both the mother
this is what my daughter told me said the farmer and i come to acquaint you with it i leave you to judge how much i was surprised i went immediately to my farmer to speak to his daughter myself
as soon as i arrived i went forthwith to the stall where my son was kept he could not return my embraces but received them in such a manner as fully satisfied me he was my son
my good maid said i can you restore my son to his former shape yes she replied i can
except on two conditions the first is that you give him to me for my husband and the second that you allow me to punish the person who changed him into a calf as to the first i replied
as to what relates to my wife i also agree a person who has been capable of committing such a criminal action justly deserves to be punished
only i must pray you not to take her life i am going then answered she to treat her as she treated your son to this i consent said i
provided you first of all restore to me my son
pronounced over it words that i did not understand and addressing herself to the calf o calf if thou west created by the almighty and sovereign master of the world such as thou appearest at this time continue in that form
but if thou be a man and art changed into a calf by enchantment return to thy natural shape by the permission of the sovereign creator as she spoke she threw water upon him
and in an instant he recovered his natural form my son
with such a transport of joy that i knew not what i was doing it is heaven that hath sent us this young maid to remove the horrible charm by which you were enchanted and to avenge the injury done to you and your mother i doubt not
but in acknowledgment you will make your deliverer your wife as i have promised he joyfully consented but before they married she changed my wife into a hind and this is she whom you see here
i desired she might have this shape rather than another less agreeable that we might see her in the family without horror since that time my son is become a widower and gone to travel
it being now several years since i heard of him i am come abroad to inquire after him and not being willing to trust anybody with my wife till i should return home i thought fit to take her everywhere with me
this is the history of myself and this hind is it not one of the most wonderful and surprising i admit it is said the genie and on that account forgive the merchant one third of his crime
the story of the grecian king
there was in the country of yunaun or greece a king who was leprous and his physicians had in vain endeavoured his cure
arrived at his court this physician had learnt the theory of his profession in greek persian turkish arabic latin syriac and hebrew books he was an experienced natural philosopher
i know said he after the usual ceremonials that your majestys physicians have not been able to heal you of the leprosy but if you will accept my service i will engage to cure you without potions
or external applications the king listened to what he said and answered if you be able to perform what you promise i will enrich you and your posterity
do you assure me that you will cure my leprosy without potion or applying any external medicine yes sire replied the physician i promise myself success through gods assistance
and to morrow with your majestys permission i will make the trial the physician returned to his quarters made a hollow mace and at the handle he put in his drugs
with which next morning he presented himself before the king and falling down at his feet kissed the ground
and after a profound reverence said to the king he judged it meet that his majesty should take horse
the king did so and when he arrived there the physician came to him with the mace and said exercise yourself with this mace and strike the ball until you find your hands and body perspire
when the medicine i have put up in the handle of the mace is heated with your hand it will penetrate your whole body and as soon as you perspire you may leave off the exercise
immediately on your return to your palace go into the bath and cause yourself to be well washed and rubbed then retire to bed and when you rise to morrow you will find yourself cured
the king took the mace and struck the ball which was returned by his officers who played with him he played so long that his hands and his whole body were in a sweat and then the medicine shut up in the handle of the mace had its operation
as the physician had said upon this the king left off play returned to his palace entered the bath and observed very exactly his physician had prescribed to him
the next morning when he arose he perceived with equal wonder and joy that his leprosy was cured and his body as clean as if it had never been affected as soon as he was dressed he came into the hall of audience where he ascended his throne
and shewed himself to his courtiers who eager to know the success of the new medicine came thither betimes and when they saw the king perfectly cured expressed great joy
bowed himself before the throne with his face to the ground the king perceiving him made him sit down by his side presented him to the assembly and gave him all the commendation he deserved
but as he treated all his court that day made him eat at his table alone with him
but caused him to be clad in a rich robe
continued every day to load him with new favours but this king had a vizier who was avaricious envious and naturally capable of every kind of mischief
he could not behold without envy the presents that were given to the physician whose other merits had already begun to make him jealous
to effect this he went to the king and told him in private that he had some information of the greatest consequence to communicate the king having asked what it was sire said he
it is highly dangerous for a monarch to confide in a man whose fidelity he has never tried
i am well informed of what i have had the honour to reveal to your majesty therefore do not rest in dangerous security if your majesty be asleep be pleased to awake
and came to settle himself at your court for the sole purpose of executing the horrible design which i have intimated no no vizier interrupted the king
i am certain that this physician whom you suspect to be a villain and a traitor is one of the best and most virtuous of men you know by what medicine or rather by what miracle he cured me of my leprosy
if he had had a design upon my life why did he save me then he needed only to have left me to my disease i could not have escaped it as life was fast decaying forbear then to fill me with unjust suspicions
instead of listening to you i tell you that from this day forward i will give that great man a pension of a thousand pieces of gold per month for his life nay though i were to share with him all my riches and dominions
i should never pay him sufficiently for what he has done i perceive it to be his virtue that raises your envy but do not think i will be unjustly prejudiced against him i remember too well what a vizier said to king sinbad his master
to prevent his putting to death the prince his son what the grecian king said about king sinbad raised the viziers curiosity who said i pray your majesty to pardon me
if i have the boldness to ask what the vizier of king sinbad said to his master to divert him from putting the prince his son to death the grecian king had the condescension to satisfy him that vizier said he
after having represented to king sinbad that he ought to beware lest on the accusation of a mother in law he should commit an action of which he might afterwards repent
chapter thirty five she tried to be content which was a contradiction in terms she fanatically cleaned house all april she knitted a sweater for hugh she was diligent at red cross work
she was silent when vida raved that though america hated war as much as ever we must invade germany and wipe out every man because it was now proven that there was no soldier in the german army who was not crucifying prisoners

champ was broken his rheumatism was worse the rooms over the store were silent he could not do his work as buyer at the elevator farmers coming in with sled loads of wheat complained that champ could not read the scale
that he seemed always to be watching some one back in the darkness of the bins he was seen slipping through alleys talking to himself trying to avoid observation creeping at last to the cemetery once carol followed him
and found the coarse tobacco stained unimaginative old man lying on the snow of the grave his thick arms spread out across the raw mound as if to protect her from the cold her
who was alone there now uncared for the elevator company ezra stowbody president let him go the company ezra explained to carol had no funds for giving pensions she tried to have him appointed to the postmastership
which since all the work was done by assistants was the one sinecure in town the one reward for political purity but it proved that mister bert tybee the former bartender desired the postmastership at her solicitation
lyman cass gave champ a warm berth as night watchman
he was well but still weak from having been gassed he had been discharged and he came home as the first of the war veterans it was rumored that he surprised vida by coming unannounced that vida fainted when she saw him and for a night and day
would not share him with the town when carol saw them vida was hazy about everything except raymie and never went so far from him that she could not slip her hand under his without understanding why carol was troubled by this intensity
and raymie surely this was not raymie but a sterner brother of his this man with the tight blouse the shoulder emblems the trim legs in boots his face seemed different his lips more tight he was not raymie
he was major wutherspoon and kennicott and carol were grateful when he divulged that paris wasnt half as pretty as minneapolis that all of the american soldiers had been distinguished by their morality when on leave kennicott was respectful
to the half dozen branch stores which he was establishing at crossroads hamlets harry would be the towns rich man in the coming generation and major wutherspoon would rise with him and vida was jubilant though she was regretful at having to give up
most of her red cross work ray still needed nursing she explained when carol saw him with his uniform off in a pepper and salt suit and a new gray felt hat she was disappointed he was not major wutherspoon he was raymie
for a month small boys followed him down the street and everybody called him major
the wheat money did not remain in the pockets of the farmers the towns existed to take care of all that iowa farmers were selling their land at four hundred dollars an acre and coming into minnesota but whoever bought or sold or mortgaged
the townsmen invited themselves to the feast millers real estate men lawyers merchants and doctor will kennicott they bought land at a hundred and fifty sold it next day at a hundred and seventy and bought again
in three months kennicott made seven thousand dollars which was rather more than four times as much as society paid him for healing the sick in early summer began a campaign of boosting
but also the perfect site for factories summer cottages and state institutions in charge of the campaign was mister james blausser who had recently come to town to speculate in land mister blausser was known as a hustler
he liked to be called honest jim
nice lil wifey ill say doc and when she answered not warmly thank you very much for the imprimatur he blew on her neck and did not know that he had been insulted
he was a layer on of hands he never came to the house without trying to paw her he touched her arm let his fist brush her side she hated the man and she was afraid of him she wondered if he had heard of erik and was taking advantage
she spoke ill of him at home and in public places but kennicott and the other powers insisted maybe he is kind of a roughneck
chucked him in the ribs and said say boy
wait ll i get time and ill move the mountains here any mountain will be tickled to death to locate here once we get the white way in the town welcomed mister blausser as fully as carol snubbed him
he was the guest of honor at the commercial club banquet at the minniemashie house an occasion for menus printed in gold but injudiciously proof read for free cigars soft damp slabs of lake superior whitefish served as fillet of sole

come on you twin cities our hat is in the ring
a red headed young man who smoked cigarettes in a long amber holder carol read the booklet with a certain wonder
she learned that plover and minniemashie lakes were world famed for their beauteous wooded shores and gamey pike and bass not to be equalled elsewhere in the entire country that the residences of gopher prairie were models
of dignity comfort and culture with lawns and gardens known far and wide that the gopher prairie schools and public library in its neat and commodious building were celebrated throughout the state that the gopher prairie mills made the
best flour in the country that the surrounding farm lands were renowned
and that the stores in gopher prairie compared favorably with minneapolis and chicago in their abundance of luxuries and necessities and the ever courteous attention of the skilled clerks she learned in brief
that this was the one logical location for factories and wholesale houses
kennicott was triumphant when the commercial club did capture one small shy factory which planned to make wooden automobile wheels but when carol saw the promoter
she could not feel that his coming much mattered and a year after when he failed she could not be very sorrowful
but carol could discover no more pictures nor interesting food nor gracious voices nor amusing conversation nor questing minds she could she asserted endure a shabby but modest town
the town shabby and egomaniac she could not endure she could nurse champ perry and warm to the neighborliness of sam clark but she could not sit applauding honest jim blausser
though the armistice with germany was signed a few weeks after her coming to washington the work of the bureau continued she filed correspondence all day then she dictated answers to letters of inquiry it was an endurance of monotonous details
yet she asserted that she had found real work disillusions she did have she discovered that in the afternoon office routine stretches to the grave she discovered that an office is as full of cliques and scandals as a gopher prairie
a free sunday it did not appear that the great world needed her inspiration but she felt that her letters her contact with the anxieties of men and women all over the country were a part of vast affairs
not confined to main street and a kitchen but linked with paris bangkok madrid she perceived that she could do office work without losing any of the putative feminine virtue of domesticity that cooking and cleaning
not to have to report to kennicott at the end of the day all that she had done or might do was a relief which made up for the office weariness she felt that she was no longer one half of a marriage
white columns seen across leafy parks spacious avenues twisty alleys daily she passed a dark square house with a hint of magnolias and a courtyard behind it and a tall curtained second story window through which a woman was always peering
the woman was mystery romance a story which told itself differently every day now she was a murderess now the neglected wife of an ambassador it was mystery which carol had most lacked in gopher prairie
where every house was open to view where every person was but too easy to meet where there were no secret gates opening upon moors over which one might walk by moss deadened paths to strange high adventures in an ancient garden
as she flitted up sixteenth street after a kreisler recital given late in the afternoon for the government clerks as the lamps kindled in spheres of soft fire as the breeze flowed into the street fresh as prairie winds and kindlier
as she glanced up the elm alley of massachusetts avenue as she was rested by the integrity of the scottish rite temple she loved the city as she loved no one save hugh she encountered negro shanties turned into studios
with orange curtains and pots of mignonette marble houses on new hampshire avenue with butlers and limousines and men who looked like fictional explorers and aviators her days were swift and she knew that in her folly of running away
were the members of the tincomb methodist church a vast red brick tabernacle vida sherwin had given her a letter to an earnest woman with eye glasses plaid silk waist and a belief in bible classes who introduced her to the pastor and the
they went to sunday service sunday school christian endeavor missionary lectures church suppers precisely as they had at home they agreed that ambassadors and flippant newspapermen and infidel scientists of the bureaus
were equally wicked and to be avoided and by cleaving to tincomb church they kept their ideals from all contamination they welcomed carol asked about her husband gave her advice regarding colic in babies
passed her the gingerbread and scalloped potatoes at church suppers and in general made her very unhappy and lonely so that she wondered if she might not enlist in the militant suffrage organization and be allowed to go to jail
always she was to perceive in washington as doubtless she would have perceived in new york or london a thick streak of main street the cautious dullness of a gopher prairie appeared in boarding houses where ladylike bureau clerks
about nothing in particular the captain introduced her to the secretary of a congressman a cynical young widow with many acquaintances in the navy through her carol met commanders and majors newspapermen
chemists and geographers and fiscal experts from the bureaus and a teacher who was a familiar of the militant suffrage headquarters the teacher took her to headquarters carol never became a prominent suffragist
indeed her only recognized position was as an able addresser of envelopes but she was casually adopted by this family of friendly women who when they were not being mobbed or arrested took dancing lessons or went picnicking up the chesapeake canal
though it absorbed most of her salary an excellent nurse for hugh she herself put him to bed and played with him on holidays there were walks with him there were motionless evenings of reading but chiefly washington was associated with people
scores of them sitting about the flat talking talking talking not always wisely but always excitedly it was not at all the artists studio of which because of its persistence in fiction she had dreamed
but they played very simply and they saw no reason why anything which exists cannot also be acknowledged she was sometimes shocked quite as she had shocked gopher prairie by these girls with their cigarettes and elfish knowledge
the presence of hugh made her feel temporary some day oh shed have to take him back to open fields and the right to climb about hay lofts but the fact that she could never be eminent among these scoffing enthusiasts
did not keep her from being proud of them from defending them in imaginary conversations with kennicott who grunted she could hear his voice theyre simply a bunch of wild impractical theorists sittin round chewing the rag and
the acceptance of women without embarrassed banter for which she had longed in gopher prairie yet they seemed to be as efficient as the sam clarks she concluded that it was because they were of secure reputation not hemmed in by the fire of provincial jealousies
kennicott had asserted that the villagers lack of courtesy is due to his poverty were no millionaire dudes he boasted yet these army and navy men these bureau experts and organizers of multitudinous leagues
that institution is reserved for men like kennicott who after devoting fifty years to putting aside a stake incontinently invest the stake in spurious oil stocks
she found the same faith not only in girls escaped from domesticity but also in demure old ladies who tragically deprived of esteemed husbands and huge old houses
yet managed to make a very comfortable thing of it by living in small flats and having time to read but she also learned that by comparison gopher prairie was a model of daring color clever planning and frenzied intellectuality
from her teacher housemate she had a sardonic description of a middlewestern railroad division town of the same size as gopher prairie but devoid of lawns and trees a town where the tracks sprawled along the cinder scabbed main street and the railroad shops
dripping soot from eaves and doorway rolled out smoke in greasy coils other towns she came to know by anecdote a prairie village where the wind blew all day long and the mud was two feet thick in spring and in summer
new england mill towns with the hands living in rows of cottages like blocks of lava a rich farming center in new jersey off the railroad furiously pious ruled by old men unbelievably ignorant old men
sitting about the grocery talking of james g blaine a southern town full of the magnolias and white columns which carol had accepted as proof of romance but hating the negroes obsequious to the old families
a western mining settlement like a tumor a booming semi city with parks and clever architects visited by famous pianists and unctuous lecturers but irritable from a struggle between union labor and the manufacturers association
the lines are broken and uncertain of direction often instead of rising they sink in wavering scrawls and the colors are watery blue and pink and the dim gray of rubbed pencil marks a few lines are traceable
unhappy women are given to protecting their sensitiveness by cynical gossip by whining by high church and new thought religions or by a fog of vagueness carol had hidden in none of these refuges from reality
but she who was tender and merry had been made timorous by gopher prairie even her flight had been but the temporary courage of panic the thing she gained in washington was not information about office systems and labor unions but renewed courage
that amiable contempt called poise her glimpse of tasks involving millions of people and a score of nations reduced main street from bloated importance to its actual pettiness she could never again be quite so awed by the power
she caught something of an impersonal attitude saw that she had been as touchily personal as maud dyer and why she began to ask did she rage at individuals not individuals but institutions are the enemies
and they most afflict the disciples who the most generously serve them
chapter seven johnny chuck joins the class
peter rabbit delivered mother natures message to johnny chuck johnny didnt seem at all pleased he grumbled and growled to himself he didnt want to go to school he didnt want to learn anything about his relatives
he was perfectly satisfied with things as they were the truth is johnny chuck was already beginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy as a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home
so he seldom goes far from his own doorstep peter left him grumbling and growling and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear old briar patch he knew that johnny chuck would not dare disobey old mother nature
sure enough the next morning johnny chuck came waddling through the green forest just as old mother nature was about to open school he didnt look at all happy and he didnt reply at all to the greetings of the others
it wasnt for your benefit that i sent word for you to be here this morning it was for the benefit of your friends and neighbors now sit up so that all can get a good look at you
one should call them this is more than i can understand belong to the marmot branch of the squirrel family and wherever found they look much alike as you will notice johnny chucks coat is brownish yellow
his feet are very dark brown almost black his head is dark brown with light gray on his cheeks beneath he is reddish orange including his throat his tail is short for a member of the squirrel family
he has a number of whiskers and they are black some woodchucks are quite gray and occasionally there is one who is almost or wholly black just as there are black gray squirrels
johnny here is not fond of the green forest but loves the old orchard and the green meadows in some parts of the country there are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the green forest you will notice that johnny has stout claws
i can climb if i have to retorted johnny chuck indignantly ive climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times and if i can get a good run first i can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branches if they are not too far above ground
johnny chuck certainly is right at home when it comes to digging you ought to be thankful that he is said old mother nature for the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once by the way peter since you are so well acquainted with those holes
peter was delighted to air his knowledge the last one i was in said he was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and then straightening out the entrance was quite large with a big heap of sand out in front of it
down a little way the tunnel grew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way way down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass in it there were one or two other little rooms
and there were two branch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground making side or back doorways there was no sand around either of these and they were quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them
those back doorways are very handy in time of danger do you always have three doorways asked happy jack
and once in a while only one but that isnt really safe
sometimes however if we cannot find a place that just suits us we go quite a distance are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground asked jumper the hare of course replied johnny chuck
no replied johnny chuck give me green food every time there is nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass unless it be some of those fine vegetables farmer brown grows in his garden
i am as thin as i was fat in the fall this is because i have used up the fat waiting for the first green things to appear do you have many enemies asked peter rabbit who has so many himself that he is constantly thinking of them
i am afraid of shadow the weasel reddy fox has tried to dig me out more than once but i can dig faster than he can if he ever gets me cornered hell find that i can fight
time is up interrupted old mother nature
and on the prairies of the great west he has a smaller cousin named
and to morrow ill tell you about them if you want me to
johnny chuck hung his head for he was a little ashamed that he had been so unwilling to come that morning if you please mother nature said he i think ill come i didnt know i had any close relatives and i want to know about them
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet
which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric
he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night
and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study
grief does not stun me i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows
no said villefort only return again at eleven oclock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned
shall you be present in the reception room no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall work doctor
everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in study
a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat
and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required at twelve oclock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court
equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess gradually the reception room filled
and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army
less owing to his social position than to his personal merit the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves
and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover
one of them was made of debray chateau renaud and beauchamp poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl
so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene chateau renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract indeed no said chateau renaud did you know her
the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us who is he
the gentleman who receives us is he a deputy oh no i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper
it has been mentioned but the article is not mine
he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said chateau renaud
but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man
his banker danglars is his banker is he not asked chateau renaud of debray i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel
still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about to night this funeral is the news of the day but hush here comes our minister of justice
and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile well said he extending his hand to monte cristo
for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of
he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing
but we all have our faults do you know count that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead
and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter
eugenie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do
she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left
no with a relation but still we have quite lost our dear eugenie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo
family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion
that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power
as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich
if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so
there was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling are they spanish haitian
or neapolitan bonds said monte cristo no said danglars smiling
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million
to the governor of the bank please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account baron danglars
one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a croesus you are this is how i transact business said danglars it is really wonderful said the count above all
it is indeed said danglars it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done five millions on five little scraps of paper it must be seen to be believed
no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself i am credited on you for six millions i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs
you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us
and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning oh well then said monte cristo
pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable but here are your bonds pay me differently
that is being wrested from its grasp suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance certainly he said your receipt is money
oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson and french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars
while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair yes keep it keep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time
no decidedly no keep my signatures but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds how absurd
as if one crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket book but
there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously
i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence
i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me
who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left the counts sad face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips good morning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me
the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you
but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt
you did see him i think yes well
how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson and french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank my funds are deposited there and you can understand
that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling come said boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left
and who bowed to me as though he knew me
five millions here is his receipt believe your own eyes
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk and he had five millions in your hands alone why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is
he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of one hundred thousand francs
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to twenty thousand francs a month it is magnificent
i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son what example they gave all their fortune to the hospitals what fortune their own
for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired
upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not much
from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs but to return to our millions
are you then pressed for this money yes for the examination of our cash takes place to morrow to morrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place at two oclock
now i think of it you can do better said danglars how do you mean
take it to rothschilds or lafittes and they will take it off your hands at once
certainly it will only cost you a discount of five thousand or six thousand francs the receiver started back ma foi he said i prefer waiting till to morrow what a proposition
that you had a deficiency to make up indeed said the receiver and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be to morrow yes but without fail
ah you are laughing at me send to morrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands
no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong how were you to blame in that affair
listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive
they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain
after expressing acute sympathy with the father
with an energy of action those can alone understand
fool then enclosing monte cristos receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve oclock i shall then be far away then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes
burned several papers left others exposed to view
a fathom deep in sleep i lie with old desires restrained before to clamor lifeward with a cry as dark flies out the greying door and so in quest of creeds to share i seek assertive day again
but old monotony is there endless avenues of rain oh might i rise again might i throw off the heat of that old wine see the new morning mass the sky with fairy towers line on line
the air became gray and opalescent a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way then another light then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision under his feet a thick iron studded skylight turned yellow
in the street the lamps of the taxi cabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement the unwelcome november rain had perversely stolen the days last hour and pawned it with that ancient fence the night
the silence of the theatre behind him ended with a curious snapping sound followed by the heavy roaring of a rising crowd and the interlaced clatter of many voices the matinee was over
he stood aside edged a little into the rain to let the throng pass a small boy rushed out sniffed in the damp fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat came three or four couples in a great hurry
came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glanced invariably first at the wet street then at the rain filled air finally at the dismal sky last a dense strolling mass
that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of stale powder on women after the thick crowd came another scattering a stray half dozen a man on crutches
finally the rattling bang of folding seats inside announced that the ushers were at work new york seemed not so much awakening as turning over in its bed pallid men rushed by pinching together their coat collars
a great swarm of tired magpie girls from a department store crowded along with shrieks of strident laughter three to an umbrella a squad of marching policemen passed already miraculously protected by oilskin capes the rain gave amory a feeling of detachment
and the numerous unpleasant aspects of city life without money occurred to him in threatening procession there was the ghastly stinking crush of the subway the car cards thrusting themselves at one leering out like dull bores who grab your arm with another story
the querulous worry as to whether some one isnt leaning on you a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman hating her for it the woman hating him for not doing it at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath
at best just people too hot or too cold tired worried he pictured the rooms where these people lived where the patterns of the blistered wall papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds
and always there was the economical stuffiness of indoor winter and the long summers nightmares of perspiration between sticky enveloping walls dirty restaurants where careless tired people helped themselves to sugar with their own used coffee spoons
leaving hard brown deposits in the bowl it was not so bad where there were only men or else only women it was when they were vilely herded that it all seemed so rotten it was some shame that women gave off at having men see them tired and poor
it was some disgust that men had for women who were tired and poor it was dirtier than any battle field he had seen
and danger it was an atmosphere wherein birth and marriage and death were loathsome secret things he remembered one day in the subway when a delivery boy had brought in a great funeral wreath of fresh flowers
how the smell of it had suddenly cleared the air and given every one in the car a momentary glow i detest poor people thought amory suddenly i hate them for being poor poverty may have been beautiful once but its rotten now
and saying something to his companion with a look of utter disgust probably thought amory what he said was my god arent people horrible never before in his life had amory considered poor people
he thought cynically how completely he was lacking in all human sympathy o henry had found in these people romance pathos love hate amory saw only coarseness physical filth and stupidity he made no self accusations
never any more did he reproach himself for feelings that were natural and sincere he accepted all his reactions as a part of him unchangeable unmoral this problem of poverty transformed magnified attached to some grander
more dignified attitude might some day even be his problem at present it roused only his profound distaste he walked over to fifth avenue dodging the blind black menace of umbrellas and standing in front of delmonicos hailed an auto bus
somewhere in his mind a conversation began rather resumed its place in his attention it was composed not of two voices but of one which acted alike as questioner and answerer question well whats the situation answer
that i have about twenty four dollars to my name question
i cant imagine not being able to
really they are the only things i can do question be definite
i dont know what ill do nor have i much curiosity to morrow im going to leave new york for good its a bad town unless youre on top of it question do you want a lot of money a
no i am merely afraid of being poor question very afraid
just passively afraid question
dont ask me question dont you care
rather i dont want to commit moral suicide question have you no interests left
none ive no more virtue to lose just as a cooling pot gives off heat so all through youth and adolescence we give off calories of virtue thats whats called ingenuousness question an interesting idea
thats why a good man going wrong attracts people they stand around and literally warm themselves at the calories of virtue he gives off sarah makes an unsophisticated remark and the faces simper in delight how innocent the poor child is
theyre warming themselves at her virtue but sarah sees the simper and never makes that remark again only she feels a little colder after that question all your calories gone
all of them im beginning to warm myself at other peoples virtue question are you corrupt
i think so im not sure im not sure about good and evil at all any more question is that a bad sign in itself
not necessarily question what would be the test of corruption
becoming really insincere calling myself not such a bad fellow thinking i regretted my lost youth when i only envy the delights of losing it
they dont they just want the fun of eating it all over again the matron doesnt want to repeat her girlhood she wants to repeat her honeymoon
this dialogue merged grotesquely into his minds most familiar state a grotesque blending of desires worries exterior impressions and physical reactions one hundred and twenty seventh street or one hundred and thirty seventh street
two and three look alike no not much seat damp are clothes absorbing wetness from seat or seat absorbing dryness from clothes sitting on wet substance gave appendicitis so froggy parkers mother said well hed had it
ill sue the steamboat company beatrice said and my uncle has a quarter interest did beatrice go to heaven probably not he represented beatrices immortality also love affairs of numerous dead men who surely had never thought of him
if it wasnt appendicitis influenza maybe what one hundred and twentieth street
one o two instead of one two seven rosalind not like beatrice eleanor like beatrice only wilder and brainier apartments along here expensive probably hundred and fifty a month maybe two hundred
uncle had only paid hundred a month for whole great big house in minneapolis question were the stairs on the left or right as you came in anyway in twelve univee they were straight back and to the left what a dirty river

wonder what humbirds body looked like now if he himself hadnt been bayonet instructor hed have gone up to line three months sooner probably been killed wheres the darned bell
and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile there an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum car the tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside
nicholl once introduced with his companions inside the projectile began to close the opening by means of a strong plate held in position by powerful screws other plates closely fitted
covered the lenticular glasses and the travelers hermetically enclosed in their metal prison were plunged in profound darkness and now my dear companions said michel ardan
gas was not invented for moles so saying the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the sole of his boot and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle in which the carbonized hydrogen
stored at high pressure sufficed for the lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty four hours or six days and six nights the gas caught fire
and thus lighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly padded walls furnished with a circular divan and a roof rounded in the shape of a dome michel ardan examined everything
you smile barbicane
do you say to yourself this prison may be our tomb tomb perhaps still i would not change it for mahomets which floats in space but never advances an inch
while michel ardan was speaking barbicane and nicholl were making their last preparations nicholls chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten p m when the three travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile
this chronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of murchison the engineer barbicane consulted it my friends said he it is twenty minutes past ten at forty seven minutes past ten
murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire which communicates with the charge of the columbiad at that precise moment we shall leave our spheroid thus we still have twenty seven minutes to remain on the earth
well exclaimed michel ardan in a good humored tone much may be done in twenty six minutes
well twenty four if you like my noble captain said ardan twenty four minutes in which to investigate michel said barbicane during the passage we shall have plenty of time to investigate the most difficult questions
for the present we must occupy ourselves with our departure are we not ready doubtless but there are still some precautions to be taken to deaden as much as possible the first shock
have we not the water cushions placed between the partition breaks whose elasticity will sufficiently protect us i hope so michel replied barbicane gently but i am not sure
asked barbicane humph said michel ardan it is not easy we are in the train and the guards whistle will sound before twenty four minutes are over twenty said nicholl
for some moments the three travelers looked at each other then they began to examine the objects imprisoned with them everything is in its place said barbicane
we have now to decide how we can best place ourselves to resist the shock position cannot be an indifferent matter and we must as much as possible prevent the rush of blood to the head
no said barbicane let us stretch ourselves on our sides we shall resist the shock better that way remember that when the projectile starts it matters little whether we are in it or before it
replied the captain weve still thirteen minutes and a half that nicholl is not a man exclaimed michel he is a chronometer with seconds an escape and eight holes
we might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these americans made to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added no pulsation
three thick and solidly made couches had been placed in the projectile nicholl and barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the floor
there the three travelers were to stretch themselves some moments before their departure during this time ardan not being able to keep still turned in his narrow prison like a wild beast in a cage
chatting with his friends speaking to the dogs diana and satellite to whom as may be seen he had given significant names ah diana ah satellite
he exclaimed teasing them so you are going to show the moon dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth that will do honor to the canine race if ever we do come down again
i will bring a cross type of moon dogs which will make a stir if there are dogs in the moon said barbicane there are said michel ardan just as there are horses cows
donkeys and chickens i bet that we shall find chickens a hundred dollars we shall find none said nicholl done my captain replied ardan clasping nicholls hand but by the bye
thirty seven minutes six seconds past ten it is understood captain well before another quarter of an hour you will have to count nine thousand dollars to the president
four thousand because the columbiad will not burst and five thousand because the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air
i only ask to be allowed to pay come nicholl i see that you are a man of method which i could never be but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage to yourself allow me to tell you
and why asked nicholl because if you gain the first the columbiad will have burst and the projectile with it and barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse your dollars my stake is deposited at the bank in baltimore
replied barbicane simply and if nicholl is not there it will go to his heirs ah you practical men exclaimed michel ardan i admire you the more for not being able to understand you
at the bottom of a gun nine hundred feet long and under this projectile are rammed four hundred thousand pounds of gun cotton which is equal to one million six hundred thousand pounds of ordinary powder and friend murchison
his eye fixed on the needle his finger on the electric apparatus is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us into interplanetary space enough michel enough
said barbicane in a serious voice let us prepare
one clasp of the hand my friends yes exclaimed michel ardan more moved than he wished to appear and the three bold companions were united in a last embrace god preserve us
barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down by his companions and the profound silence was only broken by the ticking of the chronometer marking the seconds
sustains the shortest lived human beings of our universe it is seldom that any of the creatures reach more than four years of age according to our standards of time
they are nearly as large as we and relatively much lighter in weight all the periods of physical growth are correspondingly decreased children walk four or five weeks after birth
and are capable of receiving regular instruction at the age of five months strange as it may seem this sphere which for convenience we will call brief
revolves very slowly on its axis so that our world makes fifteen times as many revolutions as this planet it requires but little arithmetic to figure out that the people of brief do not see the sun rise very often
on this world of brief all vegetables mature in periods so short that one marvels when he hears it think of cereals reaching maturity in seven or eight of our days or during one day of brief
early in the morning certain crops are planted and are harvested at night two or more days are required for maturing other crops actually the people of brief raise their crops with less labor than is required amongst us
if you were permitted to look upon the public and private life of this incredible world your first sensation would be dizziness not to mention the weirdness of all sights that would confront you at every turn
and if by lease of strength they pass on toward an age of four years it is but an evidence of their exceptional vitality it seems to be true that the experiences of a long life of sixty or eighty years is crowded into a narrow compass of four years
there being no competition no time or space is required for sensational trash thus if nothing of importance occurs nothing need be transmitted the official news censors decide as to the relative importance of occurrences
there need not be a certain amount of news telegraphed each hour the government verifies as much as possible all reports before they are transmitted there are indeed some advantages in the government being in constant touch with each home under its care
the advertising department pays nearly all expenses of this whole system of journalism announcements for private gain are paid at a regular rate it costs more to advertise at certain periods than at other times
they never think of covering the feet under any change of climate if one of the briefites were to step upon the shores of our rugged earth and see the cotton or wool and leather that lies around our feet it would appear to him as the most ridiculous thing imaginable
neither the men women nor children seem to seek this means for self beautifying they seem to think that beauty of character has a radiance more to be desired than the flash of opals or the luster of silks their garments partake of the loose flowing order
for instance a strong fabric of chosen shade is fastened at the neck hip knee and ankle and lies carelessly over the parts between the females never graduated to the corset degree and while they do not cut a scientific figure
transportation the methods of traveling are so contrary to our conceptions and practices that i almost forbear to attempt any description
when an exchange of seats is necessary it is all done so easily and so quickly that you would wonder why we tolerate trolley cars in traveling from city to city a system is in use that i will call the toboggan slide system
although the cars run on wheels the car is raised in a shaft about one hundred feet and then by gravity it dashes two or more miles according to the lay of the land traversed then another rise more or less than one hundred feet is experienced
and then another wild dash i have no words of praise for this system although the briefites can cover considerable territory in an hour they look upon this gravity system as a wonderful achievement for it has not been in operation for more than three hundred years
the power of steam has never been utilized no genius of all this active world of brief ever conceived the idea that almost unlimited power lies wrapped up in thin vapory water but they have discovered what we would call gaseous oil
and have learned to put it to work so that it is the main force employed in hoisting and all other purposes where power is required nothing like a traveling locomotive has ever been made although i learned that a bright wizard was experimenting
and that he prophesied great changes when his gas propelled vehicle was perfected think of how much value an ordinary citizen of our world would be to these briefites if he could step upon their world and communicate with them concerning the magic wonders of steam
and the manner of constructing stationary and movable engines to say nothing of the hidden wonders of electricity quadrupeds that take the place of our horses are used for drayage although nothing except the two wheeled class of vehicles was ever used until some eighty seven years ago
public highways these interesting people excel us in their style and manner of home building fencing and making public highways we are heathenish in our progress along the line of road making especially
in all my vast journey among the worlds i found only a few comparatively whereon the roads were inferior to ours in the world of brief the state prescribes the manner of public highways and each citizen must contribute his share to their creation and maintenance
very intricate and elaborate problems are solved by these people of a few years they are inferior to us in a hundred ways in the broad fields of manufacture and invention they lag a long distance in the rear this is principally due to their lack of time
religious life the religious life of the people of brief is on an average of a higher type than is found in our world their belief in immortality has run parallel with their existence as a people
the most faithful translation of this word into our language would be god affluence kerm cher or god breath appeared upon brief full grown
similar to christ he confirmed his identity by unanswerable miracles many however disbelieved in kerm cher and held to the old axiomatic truths thus creeds were prevalent and they remain until now
only there is much less variety than is found amongst us kerm cher set up a new reign and accepted a temporal throne for a season he finally announced that his ambassadorship would soon cease
and that his followers would lose the throne of civil power that they would be tested for a season in the valley of humiliation and by the fires of terrible persecution and that they who would endure unto the end would be glorified
moisture from the nights rain hung on the tree leaves clung in globules to rynchs sweating body he lay on a wide branch trying to control the heavy panting which supplied his laboring lungs
and he could still hear the echoes of the startled cries which had come from the men who had threaded through the woods to the up pointed tail fins of the l b now he tried to reason why he had run they were his own kind
they would take him out of the loneliness of a world heretofore empty of his species but that tall man the one who had led the party into the irregular clearing about the life boat rynch shivered
dug his nails into the wood on which he lay at the sight of that man dream and reality had crashed together sending him into panic stricken flight that was the man from the room
the man with the cup as his heart quieted he began to think more coherently first he had not been able to find the strong jawss den
then the marks on the ground at the point from which he had fallen and the l b were here just as he remembered but not far from the small ship he had discovered something more a campsite with a shelter fashioned out of spalls and vines
to go back to the ship clearing was to risk capture but he had to know rynch looked with more attention at his present surroundings deep mold under the trees here would hold tracks there might just be another way to move
though it was balled in upon itself he was sure the creature was fully as large as he and the menacing claws suggested it was a formidable opponent when it made no move to follow him
rynch began to hope it had only been defending its own hiding place for its present attitude suggested concealment still facing that featureless blob in the tree the man retreated alert for the first sign of advance on the part of the creature above
none came and he dared to slip around the bole of the tree under which he stood listening intently for any corresponding movement overhead now he was facing that survivors camp
another object crouched in the dark of the lean to shelter just as its fellow was on sentry duty in the tree only this one did not have the self color of the foliage to disguise it four limbed its long forearms curved about its bent knees
and the sense organs of eyes and nose squeezed together on the lower quarter of the rounded portion with a line of wide mouth to split the blunt round of the muzzle dark pits for eyes showed no pupil iris or cornea
the nose was a black perfectly rounded tube jutting an inch or so beyond the cheek surface grotesque alien and terrifying it made no hostile move and since it had not turned its head he could not be sure it had even sighted him
but it knew he was there he was certain of that and was waiting for what as the long seconds crawled by rynch began to believe that it was not waiting for him heartened he pulled at the vine loop
climbed back into the tree minutes later he discovered that there were more than two of the beasts waiting quietly about the camp and that their sentry line ran between him and the clearing of the l b he withdrew farther into the wood
intent upon finding a detour which would bring him out into the open lands now he wanted to join forces with his own kind whether those men were potential enemies or not as time passed the beasts closed about the clearing of the camp
afternoon was fading into evening when he reached a point several miles downstream near the river since he had come into the open he had not sighted any of the watchers he hoped they did not willingly venture out of the trees where the leaves were their protection
rynch went flat on the stream bank made a worms progress up the slope to crouch behind a bush and survey the land immediately ahead there stood an off world spacer fins down nose skyward
and grouped not too far from its landing ramp a collection of bubble tents a fire burned in their midst and men were moving about it now that he was free from the wood and its watchers and had come so near to his goal
rynch was curiously reluctant to do the sensible thing to rise out of concealment and walk up to that fire to claim rescue by his own kind the man he sought stood by the fire
shrugging his arms into a webbing harness which brought a box against his chest having made that fast he picked up a needler by its sling by their gestures the others were arguing with him but he shook his head came on
that idea made sense and in the meantime he would let the other past him follow along behind until he was far enough from the camp so that his friends could not interfere then they would have a meeting
in spite of his caution rynch was close to betrayal as he edged around a clump of vegetation growing half in half out of the stream only a timely rustle told him that the other had sat down on a drift log waiting for him rynch froze
so startled that he could not think clearly for a second then he noted that the outline of the others body was visible growing brighter by the moment minute particles of pale greenish radiance were gathering about the other the dark shadow of an arm flapped the radiance swirled
but they no longer gathered in strength enough to light his presence now he could see they drifted about the vegetation about the log where the man sat about rocks and reeds only they were thicker about the stranger as if his body were a magnet
he continued to keep them whirling by means of waving hand and arm but there was enough light to show rynch the fingers of his other hand busy on the front panel of the box he wore that fingering stopped then rynchs head came up as he heard a very faint sound
not a beasts cry or was it again those fingers moved on the panel was the other sending a message by that means rynch watched him check the webbing count the equipment at his belt settle the needler in the crook of his arm
however the other was as wary of that dark as if he suspected what might lie in wait there he angled along northward avoiding clumps of scattered brush keeping in the open where rynch dared not tail him too closely
their course parallel to the woods brought them at last to a second stream the size of a river into which the first creek emptied here the other settled down between two rocks with every indication of remaining there for a period
thankfully rynch found his own lurking place from which he could keep the other in sight the light points gathered hung in a small luminous cloud over the rocks but rynch had prudently withdrawn under a bush
and the scent of its aromatic leaves must have discouraged the sparks for no such crown came to his sentry post drugged with fatigue the younger man slept awaking to full day a fog of bewilderment
what was the purpose of the others expedition was he going to use the open cut through which the river ran as a way of penetrating the wooded country now rynch considered the problem from his own angle the man from the spacer had made no effort to conceal his trail
in fact it would almost seem that he had deliberately gone out of his way to leave boot prints on favorable stretches of ground did he guess that rynch lurked behind was now leading him on for some purpose of his own
or were those traces left to guide another party from the camp to advance openly up the stream bed was to invite discovery rynch surveyed the nearer bank clumps of small trees and high growing bushes dotted that expanse an ideal cover
that sound of snarling spitting hate ended in mid cry as rynch crawled to the river bank the man from the spacer camp had been the focus of a three prong attack from a female and her cubs
three red bodies were flat and still on the gravel as the off worlder leaned back against a rock breathing heavily as rynch sighted him he stooped to recover the needler he had dropped lurched away from the rock towards the water
clawed at the ground about him already he was buried to his knees then his mid thighs in the artificial quicksand but he had not lost his head and was jerking from side to side in an effort to pull free rynch got to his feet
walked with slow deliberation down to the rivers brink the trapped prisoner had shied halfway around stretching out his arms to find a firmer grip on some rock large and heavy enough to anchor him after his first startled cry he had made no sound
but now as he sighted rynch his eyes widened and his lips parted the box on his chest caught on a stone he had dragged to him in a desperate try for support
there was a spitting of sparks and the stranger worked frantically at the buckle of the webbing harness to loosen it and toss the whole thing from him the box struck one of the dead water cats flashed as fur and flesh were singed
rynch watched dispassionately before he caught the needler jerking it away from the prisoner the man eyed him steadily and his expression did not alter even when rynch swung the off world weapon to center its sights on the late owner
suppose rynchs voice was rusty sounding in his own ears we talk now the man nodded
chapter twenty seven but we must follow edward for a time on his arrival at paris he was kindly received by king charles who promised to assist his views in joining the army
you have to choose between two generals both great in the art of war
and turenne i have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon that will be the better for you as you will learn tactics from such great players which would your majesty recommend me to follow inquired edward
and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the english throne
i will give you letters to conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong that is not your affair
conde is just now released from vincennes but depend upon it he will be in arms very soon as soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of conde
you are here highly spoken of said the prince for so young a man so you were at the affair of worcester we will retain you for your services will be wanted by and by
can you procure any of your countrymen i know but of two that i can recommend from personal knowledge but these two officers i can venture to pledge myself for any more
bring me the officers to morrow at this hour monsieur beverley au revoir
edward went to chaloner and grenville who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them the next day they were at the princes levee and introduced by edward i am fortunate gentlemen
said the prince in securing the services of such fine young men you will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service and then follow me to guienne to which province i am now about to depart
and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required a month after this interview conde who had been joined by a great number of nobles
and had been re enforced by troops from spain set up the standard of revolt edward and his friends joined them with about three hundred english and scotchmen which they had enlisted and very soon afterward
conde obtained the victory at blenan and in april sixteen fifty two advanced to paris turenne who had taken the command of the french army followed him
and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb of saint antoine in which neither party had the advantage
and not receiving the assistance he expected from the spaniards he fell back to the frontiers of champagne previous to his departure from paris edward had received humphreys letter explaining away the intendants conduct
and the contents removed a heavy load from edwards mind but he now thought of nothing but war and although he cherished the idea of patience heatherstone he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could
he wrote a letter to the intendant thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions toward him and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again he did not however think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter
except in inquiring after her health and sending his respects it may be years before i see her again thought edward and who knows what may happen
and edward with his friends followed his fortunes and gained his good will they were rapidly promoted time flew on and in the year sixteen fifty four the court of france concluded an alliance with cromwell
and expelled king charles from the french frontiers the war was still carried on in the netherlands turenne bore down conde who had gained every campaign and the court of spain wearied with reverses
made overtures of peace which was gladly accepted by the french during these wars cromwell had been named protector and had shortly afterward died
edward who but rarely heard from humphrey was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king who was in spain but to leave his colors while things were adverse was impossible
after the peace and the pardon of conde by the french king the armies were disbanded and the three adventurers were free they took their leave of the prince who thanked them for their long and meritorious services
and they then hastened to king charles who had left spain and come to the low countries at the time of their joining the king richard the son of cromwell who had been nominated protector had resigned and every thing was ready for the restoration
on the fifteenth of may sixteen sixty the news arrived that charles had been proclaimed king on the eighth and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over the king sailed from scheveling
was met at dover by general monk and conducted to london which he entered amid the acclamations of the people on the twenty ninth of the same month we may leave the reader to suppose that edward
were among the most favored of those in his train as the procession moved slowly along the strand through a countless multitude the windows of all the houses were filled with well dressed ladies who waved their white kerchiefs to the king
and his attendant suit chaloner edward and grenville who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting were certainly the most distinguished among the kings retinue look edward
at those lovely girls at yon window do you recognize them indeed i do not are they any of our paris beauties
they are thy sisters alice and edith
it is so i believe replied edward yes now that edith smiles im sure it is them yes replied grenville
will they think you recognize us we shall see replied edward
for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped is it possible thought edward that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that i left at the cottage and yet it must be
well chaloner to all appearance your good aunts have done justice to their charge nature has done more edward i never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have
although i always thought that they were handsome as they passed edward caught the eye of edith and smiled alice thats edward said edith so loud as to be heard by the king and all near him
alice and edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs but they were soon obliged to cease and put them to their eyes are those your sisters edward said the king they are your majesty
the king rose in his stirrups and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing we shall have some court beauties beverley said the king looking at him over his shoulder as soon as the ceremonies were over
and they could escape from their personal attentions edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the ladies conynghame and his sisters we pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years absence and the pleasure
which it gave to edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women that his two friends who were as the reader will recollect old acquaintances of alice and edith were warmly received we hardly need say
now edward who do you think was here to day the reigning belle and the toast of all the gentlemen indeed i must be careful of my heart dear edith who is she
no less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted edward patience heatherstone patience heatherstone cried edward the toast of all london yes and deservedly so
i can assure you but she is as good as she is handsome and moreover treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference she is staying with her uncle sir ashley cooper and her father is also in town
with her to day when did you hear from humphrey edith a few days back he has left the cottage now altogether indeed where does he reside then at arnwood the house has been rebuilt
and i understand is a very princely mansion humphrey has charge of it until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong it belongs to mister heatherstone does it not replied edward
how can you say so edward you received humphreys letters a long while ago yes i did but let us not talk about it any more my dear edith i am in great perplexity
what is your perplexity well replied edward since it is to be so let us sit down and talk over the matter i acknowledge the kindness of mister heatherstone
and feel that all he asserted to humphrey is true still i do not like that i should be indebted to him for a property which is mine and that he has no right to give i acknowledge his generosity
but i do not acknowledge his right of possession nay much as i admire and i may say fond as i am for time has not effaced the feeling of his daughter it still appears to me that
although not said it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer and i will accept no wife on such conditions that is to say because all you wish for your property and a woman you love are offered you in one lot
you will not accept them they must be divided and handed over to you in two said alice smiling you mistake dearest i am not so foolish but i have a certain pride which you can not blame accepting the property from mister heatherstone
is receiving a favor were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter now why should i accept as a favor what i can claim as a right it is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property
he can not refuse it put not your trust in princes brother replied alice i doubt if the king or his council will consider it advisable to make so many discontented
which has been so long held by others
recollect also that mister heatherstone and his brother in law sir ashley cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have or can do they have been most important agents in his restoration
and the kings obligations to them are much greater than they are to you besides merely for what may be called a point of honor for it is no more in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty
at all events edward recollect you do not know what are the intentions of mister heatherstone wait and see what he proffers first but my dear sister it appears to me that his intentions are evident
why has he rebuilt arnwood he is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house
you were at the wars it was possible that you might or might not return he said this to humphrey who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business and recollect at the time that mister heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion
what prospect was there of the restoration of the king or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property i believe however that humphrey knows more of mister heatherstones intentions than he has made known to us
and i therefore say again my dear edward make no application till you ascertain what mister heatherstones intentions may be your advice is good my dear alice and i will be guided by it replied edward
and now let me give you some advice for your friends masters chaloner and grenville that much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands i know and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king
those who hold the property think so too and so far it is fortunate now from wiser heads than mine
but at the same time if they were to meet the parties and close with them at once before the kings intentions are known they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value now is their time
even a few days delay may make a difference they can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys impress that upon them my dear edward
and make the arrangements that is advice which must be followed replied edward we must go now and i will not fail to communicate it to them this very night we may as well here inform the reader
that the advice was immediately acted upon and that chaloner and grenville recovered all their estates at about five years purchase edward remained at court several days he had written to humphrey and had dispatched a messenger with the letter
but the messenger had not yet returned
on the following day a drawing room was to be held and edwards sisters were to be presented edward was standing with many others of the suit behind the chair of the king amusing himself with the presentations as they took place
and waiting for the arrival of his sisters chaloner and grenville were not with him they had obtained leave to go into the country for the object we have before referred to when his eyes caught advancing toward the king
mister heatherstone who led his daughter patience that they had not perceived him was evident indeed her eyes were not raised once from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty
edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions that he might gaze upon her without reserve
but little altered except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure and her court dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the new forest had concealed or which time had not matured
there was the same pensive sweet expression in her face which had altered little but the beautiful rounded arms
and the proportion of the whole figure was a surprise to him and edward in his own mind agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day mister heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance
and then his daughter was led forward and introduced by a lady unknown to edward after he had saluted her the king said loud enough for edward to hear
i trust that the daughter will often grace our court patience made no reply but passed on and soon afterward edward lost sight of her in the crowd
and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over and he was enabled to go to his sisters
when he entered the room he found himself in the arms of humphrey who had arrived with the messenger after the greetings were over edward said alice and i have seen patience and i fear i must surrender at discretion
mister heatherstone may make his own terms i must wave all pride rather than lose her i thought that i had more control over myself but i have seen her and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife
let her father but give me her and arnwood will be but a trifle in addition with respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess arnwood said humphrey i can inform you what they are
they are wholly unshackled further than that you are to repay by installments the money expended in the building of the house this i am empowered to state to you and i think you will allow that mister heatherstone
has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property he has indeed replied edward as for his daughter edward you have yet to win her and wear her
as the saying is her father will resign the property to you as yours by right but you have no property in his daughter and i suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you
but why should you say so humphrey have we not been attached from our youth yes it was a youthful passion i grant but recollect nothing came of it and years have passed away
it is now seven years since you quitted the forest and in your letters to mister heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and patience since that you have never corresponded or sent any messages
and you can hardly expect that a girl from the age of seventeen to twenty four will cherish the image of one who to say the least had treated her with indifference that is my view of the matter edward it may be wrong
and it may be true replied edward mournfully well
you know humphrey how many offers patience heatherstone has had and has every day i may say
to a proud brother of mine who does not deserve her it may be so edith replied humphrey women are riddles i only argued upon the common sense of the thing much you know about women
replied edith to be sure you do not meet many in the new forest where you have lived all your life very true my dear sister perhaps that is the reason that the new forest has had such charms for me
after that speech sir the sooner you get back again the better retorted edith but edward made a sign to humphrey and they beat a retreat have you seen the intendant humphrey no
i was about to call upon him but i wanted to see you first i will go with you i have not done him justice replied edward and yet i hardly know how to explain to him say nothing but meet him cordially
that will be explanation sufficient i shall meet him as one whom i shall always revere
what must he think of my not having called upon him nothing you hold a place at court you may not have known that he was in london as you have never met him your coming with me will make it appear so
tell him that i have just made known to you his noble and disinterested conduct you are right i will i fear however humphrey that you are right and edith wrong as regards his daughter
nay edward recollect that i have as edith observed passed my life in the woods edward was most kindly received by mister heatherstone edward
on mister heatherstone repeating to him his intentions relative to arnwood expressed his sense of that gentlemans conduct simply adding you may think me impetuous sir but i trust you will believe me grateful
patience colored up and trembled when edward first saw her edward did not refer to the past for some time after they had renewed their acquaintance he wooed her again and won her
then all was explained about a year after the restoration there was a fete at hampton court given in honor of three marriages taking place edward beverley to patience heatherstone chaloner
to alice and grenville to edith and as his majesty himself said as he gave away the brides could loyalty be better rewarded but our young readers will not be content if they do not hear
some particulars about the other personages who have appeared in our little history humphrey must take the first place his love of farming continued edward gave him a large farm rent free
and in a few years humphrey saved up sufficient to purchase a property for himself he then married clara ratcliffe who has not appeared lately on the scene owing to her having been about two years before the restoration
claimed by an elderly relation who lived in the country and whose infirm state of health did not permit him to quit the house he left his property to clara about a year after her marriage to humphrey
the cottage in the new forest was held by and eventually made over to pablo who became a very steady character and in the course of time married a young girl from arnwood and had a houseful of young gipsies
oswald so soon as edward came down to arnwood gave up his place in the new forest and lived entirely with edward as his steward and phoebe also went to arnwood and lived to a good old age
in the capacity of housekeeper her temper becoming rather worse than better as she advanced in years this is all that we have been able to collect relative to the several parties
psychotherapy and the community both the physician and the patient find their place in the community the life interests of which are superior to the interests of the individual
it is an unavoidable question how far from the higher point of view of the social mind the psychotherapeutic efforts should be encouraged or suppressed are there any conditions which suggest suspicion of or direct opposition to such curative work
of course society has to be sure that no possible misuse and damage are to result from such practice fears in that direction have been uttered repeatedly but from very different standpoints
one which is perhaps most often heard in popular circles results from an entire misunderstanding and deserves hardly any discussion after our detailed study of the processes involved it is claimed that suggestive power especially in the form of
hypnotization may be secretly misused to make anyone without his knowledge and against his will a passive instrument of the hypnotists intent often this is coupled with telepathic fancies
the hypnotist is believed to have mystic power to bring any person in a distant region under his mental control and thus to be able to carry out any sinister plans by the help of his innocent victim all hypnotizing therefore ought to be interdicted by the state
the presuppositions of such a view are as we know now entirely absurd we know that hypnotism is not based on any special power of the hypnotizer there is no magnetic fluid in the sense of the old mesmerism
the imagination of the hypnotized person is the only hypnotizing agency thus no one can be hypnotized without his knowledge or against his will the story of telepathic mysteries which is often brought before the public
is probably always the outcome of a diseased brain it is indeed a frequent symptom in paranoia and other insanities that the patient who feels abnormal organic sensations and abnormal unaccountable impulses interprets them as influences of a distant enemy
whole pamphlets have been written with elaboration of such insane misinterpretations and requests to legislatures have been made in that spirit but the physician recognizes easily throughout the whole argumentation the well known phenomena of the mental disease
to be sure while no one can be hypnotized against his will many a person is liable to accept suggestions from others and thus to carry out the wishes of others almost without knowing and certainly without willing that the other mind interfere with the interplay of the own motives
but if we were to strike out all suggestive influences from social life we should give up social life itself suggestion is given wherever men come in contact in itself it is neither good nor bad the good resolution and the bad one can be suggested
the good example and the bad can be effective both encouragement of the noble and imitation of the evil may work with the same mental technique certainly there are some persons who have a stronger influence than others on the imagination of those with whom they come in contact
their expression awakens confidence their voice and their words reach deeper layers of the mind their calmness and firmness overwhelm more easily the antagonistic ideas
but the chief difference lies after all in the different degrees of suggestibility among those who receive such impressions the easily suggestible person cannot be protected by any interdict he may catch suggestions everywhere
any advertisement in the newspaper and any display in the shop window may overrun his own intentions what he needs is training in firmness the application of reenforced suggestion or even of hypnotism in the doctors office is even for him
no possible source of danger on a higher level are objections which come from serious quarters and which are not without sympathy with true science in recent times this opposition has repeatedly found eloquent expression it is an objection from the standpoint of morality
belonging therefore entirely to the purposive view of the mind but we have now reached a point where it is our duty to do justice to this purposive view too as long as we discussed the problem entirely from the standpoint of the physician
no other view of mental life except the causal one could be in question as soon as we look at it from the standpoint of the community it becomes our duty to bring the causal and the purposive view into harmony and it would be narrow and short sighted simply to
draw the practical consequences of a naturalistic view of the mind without inquiring whether or not serious interests in the purposive sphere are injured if there is moral criticism against suggestive therapy it is the duty of the community to consider it
this opposition argues as follows hypnotic influence brings the patient under the will control of the hypnotizer and thus destroys his own freedom whatever the patient may reach in the altered states is reached without his own effort while he is the passive receiver
his achievement has therefore no moral value and if he is really cured of his drunkenness or of his perverse habits of his misuse of cocaine or of his criminal tendencies he has lost the right to be counted a moral agent it would be better
if there were more suffering in the world than that the existence of the moral will should be undermined no one ought to take such arguments lightly the spirit which directs them is needed more than anything else in our time of reaching out for superficial goods
no one can insist too earnestly that life is worth living only if it serves moral duties and moral freedom and is not determined by pleasures and absence of pain only those who set forth this argument are entirely willing to acknowledge the
profound effect which suggestive therapeutics may create more than this they have to acknowledge it to gain a basis for their attack just because the hypnotizer can entirely change the desires and passions the habits and perversities of the suffering victim
he seems to them a moral wrongdoer who negates the principle of human freedom a forcible book of recent days calls the suggestive power of the psychotherapist the great psychological crime it says to the hypnotist
by your own testimony you stand convicted of applying a process which deprives your subjects of the inalienable right and power of individual self control in proportion as you deprive him of the power of self control
you deprive him of that upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend in proportion as you deprive him of the free control and exercise of those powers of the soul upon which his individual responsibility and moral status depend
you thereby rob him of those powers upon which he must depend for the achievement of individual immortality but this censure too is entirely mistaken not because it urges the purposive views against the causal
but because it is in error as to the facts such critics are fully under the influence of the startling results which are reached they do not take the trouble to examine the long and difficult way which has had to be traversed with patience and energy
it is quite true that if i hypnotize a man and suggest to him to take up after awaking the book which lies on my table he follows my suggestion without conflict and in a certain sense without freedom he feels a simple impulse to go to the table and lift the book and
as no stronger natural desire and no moral objection stand in the way he carries out that meaningless impulse and perhaps even invents a foolish motive to explain to himself why he wanted to look at that book
but after a long experience i have my doubts as to whether a man was ever cured in such a way by hypnotism of serious disturbances and of those anomalous actions which the critics want to see overcome by the patients own moral efforts on the contrary
every suggestion has to rely on the efforts and struggles of the patient himself and all that the psychotherapists can give him is help in his own moral fight his own will is presupposition for being hypnotized
if again and again i hesitate to undertake new cases it is just because i have to see during the treatment too much of this daily and hourly striving against overpowering impulses the joy of removing some obstacles from the way of the patients
is too much overshadowed by the deep pity and sympathy with their suffering and craving during the whole period of successive treatments to make a man fight where despair is inevitable and where the enemy is necessarily stronger than his own powers can certainly not be the moral demand
morality postulates that everyone find conditions in which he can be victorious if he puts his strongest efforts to the task in our discussion of the mental symptoms i reported as an illustration of the suggestive treatment of the drug passion
the case of a morphinist to make clear this purposive side of the case as against the causal one which alone interested the physician i may add a few features to the short report as a typical example
when that man left my laboratory for the last time to go out to work and happiness you might well have believed from his joyful face that it had been an easy and pleasant time in which hypnotic influence smoothly removed from him the dangerous desire for morphine
in truth it was the result of four months of the most noble and courageous suffering and struggling he had been for years a slave to his passion to quote from his little autobiography when i realized that i was addicted to morphine
that is coming to anyone who is the user of opium or any of its alkaloids for the first few months i found great relief after every injection of morphine but soon i could not get the same easy feeling and could eat but very little and what sleep i got was in the daytime
i finally went to the sanitarium of a doctor
when i first went to see the professor in the harvard psychological laboratory i was using between thirty two and thirty eight grains of morphine daily he put me under his treatment october sixth and that day cut me down by hypnotic treatment to nine grains a day or
three doses of three grains a day i took my hypodermic as directed but on the following day i lay on the bed too exhausted to get up even to get around the room and i could not eat
the desire for the drug was something terrible but in about four days i got used to the loss of so much morphine and stayed on this amount for a week seeing the professor every other day for hypnotic treatment and then returning to my room where i spent twenty two hours of the twenty four on the bed
but did not sleep more than two or three hours a day
i was cut off by hypnotic suggestion half a grain and this put me to fighting the desire again
these reductions of the dose were made a week apart and sometimes only two days the worst time of all was a cut from four injections of a fourth of a grain each to four of one eighth of a grain each which was about january tenth
at this time i had the worst two days of my life i tried whiskey but it gave relief only for about half an hour and then the desire was worse than ever
he was thus at every moment during the day and night in full possession of the deadly poison with which he could have fully satisfied his craving it was a moral victory when he finally reached the point at which he went for several weeks without any desire for morphine
and finally presented the remaining tablets to a hospital and yet there would not have been the least chance for his winning this ethical victory without the outer help of the hypnotist we do not eliminate the moral will but we remove some unfair obstacles from its path
we have no mystic power by which our will simply takes hold of the other mans will but we inhibit and suppress by influence on the imagination those abnormal impulses which resist the sound desires if that were immoral
we should have to make up our minds that all education and training were perverted with such immoral elements every sound respect for authority which makes a child willing to accept the advice and maxims of his elders is just such an influence
if it were really a moral demand that the will be left to its own resources and that no outside influence come to strengthen its power or remove its hindrances or smooth its path then we ought to let the children grow up as nature created them
and ought not to try to suppress from without by discipline and training by love and encouragement the willful impulses and the ugly habits even every good model for imitation is such a suggestive influence from without and every solemn appeal to loyalty and friendship
to patriotism and religion increases the degree of suggestibility that is the glory of life that the suggestive power may belong to moral values instead of mere pleasures but it is not the aim of life to remain untouched by suggestion
and he who by suggestion helps the weak mind to overcome obstacles which the strong mind can overthrow from its inborn resources works for the good of the individual and of the community in the spirit of truest morality much more justified than such
ethical objections are the fears which move entirely in the causal sphere it must be acknowledged that a method which has such powerful influence over the mind that it can secure ideas and emotions and impulses which the own will of the patient cannot produce
ought to be allowed only to those who are prepared for its skillful use to hypnotize or to perform any persistent psychotherapeutic treatment may thus be dangerous if it is done by the unfit
we have discussed before the injuries which might result from the administration of such powerful psychotherapeutic effects through the best meaning minister but we can extend this fear to anyone who has not systematically studied medicine and to a certain degree normal and abnormal psychology
the possibilities of overlooking symptoms which ought to suggest an entirely different treatment or of adjusting the treatment badly to the special physical conditions or of ignoring the desirable physical supplement by drugs or of creating unintentionally by suggestion
injurious effects are always open when medical amateurs undertake such work certainly there is no physician who is not liable to make mistakes and a physician who has never given any attention to psychology and psychiatry
would also be a rather poor agent of psychotherapeutic methods but the probability is that such a physician would simply abstain by principle from all psychotherapeutic methods his mistake only begins if from his lack of acquaintance with the subject
he draws the conclusion that the method itself is undesirable that his real preparation ought to include psychological studies we have pointed out before and the time seems ripe for the community to urge such a reform of the studies
all that involves the conviction that even the experimental psychologist as such is not prepared to enter into medical treatment and a psychological clinic managed by a psychologist who is not a doctor of medicine
is certainly not better than a church clinic i cannot even acknowledge the right of psychologists to make hypnotic experiments merely for the psychological experiments sake nobody ought to be brought into a hypnotic or otherwise abnormal state of mind
if it is not suggested by the interests of the subject himself science has the right to make hypnotic experiments or experiments with abnormal mental states only under the one condition that a physician has hypnotized the subject in the interests of his health
and that the patient has agreed beforehand to allow in the presence of witnesses certain psychological studies needless to say that any hypnotization for mere amusement and as a parlor trick ought to be considered as
criminal on some other objections which interest the community as such we had to touch before and there is no need of returning to them with any fullness of argument we spoke of the danger which the mental cures carry with them when they are based on any particular creed
what is gained if some nervous disorders are helped by belief if the belief itself devastates our intellectual culture and brings the masses down again to a view of the world which has all the earmarks of barbarism
that is indeed one of the central dangers of all non medical suggestive cures that while any belief may cure through the mere emotional power of the act of believing the content of the belief gains an undeserved appearance of truth
any absurd superstition can become accredited because its curative value may be equal to a truly valuable suggestion the intellectual life of the community would have to suffer greatly if the way to be freed from bodily suffering
had to be the belief in the metaphysical doctrines of missus eddys science and health from a cultural viewpoint too suggestive therapeutics must stand the higher the more sharply it is separated from special philosophical or religious doctrines
no theory of the world and of god ought to gain authority over the mind from such an external motive as a belief in its curative effects freest from such implications is certainly the hypnotic method of the physician
who does not need the strong religious reenforcement of the suggestion because he reenforces instead the suggestibility of the patient by slight influences on his senses
even where sound religion without superstition and without pseudophilosophy stands behind the therapeutic work the community will not give up the question whether the church does not necessarily neglect by it the interests which are superior
the community becomes more and more strongly aware that too many factors of our modern society urge the church to undertake non religious work social aid and charity work ought to be filled with religious spirit
still more that is true of the healing of the sick whether or not such expansion of church activity in different directions saps the vital strength of religion itself is indeed a problem for the whole community
the fear suggests itself that the spiritual achievement may become hampered that in the competition of the church with the other agencies of social life the particular church task may be pushed to the background and that thus the church
in imitating that which others can do just as well or better loses the power to do that which the church alone can do the final outcome is therefore practically in every way the same from whatever starting point we may come we are led to the conviction
that the physician alone is called to administer psychotherapeutic work but that he needs a thorough psychological training besides his medical one but the interest of the community is not only a negative one
society does not only ask where psychical treatment can be dangerous but asks with not less right whether the scheme and the method might not be fructified for other social ends besides the mere healing of the sick if psychotherapy demonstrates that for instance
hypnotism makes possible the reshaping of a pathological mind it is a natural thought to use the same power for remodeling perhaps the lazy or the intemperate the careless or the inattentive the dishonest or the criminal mind
both educators and criminologists have indeed often raised such questions and social reformers have not seldom seen there wide perspectives for social movements in future times
there can be no doubt that the possibility of such remodeling activity is given but as far as education is concerned certainly grave misgivings ought to be felt when we spoke of the treatment of the sick
we had always to emphasize that the suggestion cures symptoms but not diseases in the same way hypnotic suggestion might reenforce a single trait but would not reform the personality of the child
yes the artificial reenforcement of such special features would deprive education of that which is the most essential namely the development of the power to overcome difficulties by own energy
wherever a reasonable amount of own will force and attention can be expected to overcome the antagonistic influence there artificial hypnotic influence ought to be avoided everything ought to be left in that case to suggestions within normal limits
in the form of good example and persuasions authority and discipline love and sympathy that holds true even for very slight abnormalities which seem still within the limits where the own energies can bring about the cure for instance
i have steadily refused requests of students and others to use hypnotism for the purpose of overcoming merely bad habits such as the habit of biting the nails a child who finds some difficulty in sticking seriously to his tasks might learn now this
and now that under the influence of hypnotic suggestions but he would remain entirely untrained for mastering the next lesson in the same way some naughty traits might be artificially removed but the child would not gain anything towards the much more important power
of suppressing an ugly tendency by his own effort all that finds its limits where the inhibitions or obstacles in the brain of the child are too strong possibly to be overcome by the own good will but in that case
psychotherapy has its right the feeble minded and the retarded child the perverse child and the emotionally unstable child belong under the care of the physician
which are at his disposal still more complex is the criminological problem it sounds like an easy remedy for the greatest social calamity if it is proposed simply to hypnotize the criminal and to supplant his antisocial will by a moral one
and if the absurdity of such a proposal is recognized it seems to many justified to demand such an intrusion at least in the case of the born criminal even if the occasional criminal cannot be reached
but the conception of the born criminal is also only a label which is superficially used for a great variety of minds that men are born with a brain which necessarily produces criminal actions is not indicated by any facts
the varieties which nature really produces are brains which are more liable than others to produce antisocial actions we recognized from the start that the abnormal mind never introduces any new elements but is characterized only by a change of proportions
there is too much or too little of a certain mental process and just for that reason there must be a steady and continuous transition from the normal to the entirely abnormal
chapter thirty four unc billy and old missus possum
all the way home from school peter rabbit did his best to think who it could be who ate flesh yet wasnt a member of the order of flesh eaters
every few hops he would stop to think but all his stopping and all his thinking were in vain and when he started for school the next morning he was as puzzled as ever
on his way through the green forest he passed a certain tree he was just past and no more when a familiar voice hailed him
whats yo hurry peter stopped abruptly and looked up in that tree there peering down at him from a hole high up in the trunk was a sharp whitish gray face
with a pair of twinkling black eyes hello unc billy cried peter how are you and ol missus possum poly peter poly
we uns havent had breakfast yet so we uns are feeling poly replied unc billy with a grin a sudden thought popped into peters head
unc poked his head a little farther out and put his hand behind his ear as if he were a little hard of hearing
am i a what he demanded
repeated peter ah reckons ah might be if ah knew what it was but as long as ah dont
mister opossum but peter wasnt listening the fact is peter had started lipperty lipperty lip for school without even being polite enough to say good by he arrived at school quite out of breath
what do you know asked old mother nature
yet doesnt belong to the order of flesh eaters
cried peter right you are replied old mother nature however did you find it out i didnt exactly find it out i guessed it replied peter
on my way here i saw unc billy and it popped into my head right away that he was one we havent heard about and must be the one but if he eats flesh
i dont see why he isnt a member of the order of flesh eaters it is because he belongs to a group which has something which makes them entirely different from all other animals and for this reason
they have been given an order of their own explained old mother nature they belong to the order of marsupials which means pouched animals
it is because the mothers have big pockets in which they carry their babies old missus possum has just such a pocket
they look too funny for anything the opossums are the only marsupials in this country continued old mother nature
now have i made it quite clear why although they eat flesh unc billy and ol missus possum are not members of the same big order as buster bear and the other flesh eaters everybody nodded
just then chatterer the red squirrel shouted here comes unc billy ol missus possum and all the little possums sure enough down the lone little path
came the possum family and a funny looking sight they were unc billy was whitish gray his face whiter than the rest of him he looked as if he had just gotten out of bed
and forgotten to brush his hair it pointed every which way his legs were dark his feet black and his toes white his ears were without any hair at all
and were black for the lower half the rest being white he had a long whitish tail without any hair on it altogether with his sharp face and naked tail
he looked a great deal as though he might be a giant rat but if unc billy was a funny looking fellow ol missus possum was even more funny looking
she seemed to have heads and tails all over her you see she had brought along her family and ol missus possum is one of those who believe in large families
there were twelve youngsters and they were exactly like their parents only small they were clinging all over ol missus possum some were on her back some were clinging to her sides
and a couple were in the big pocket where they had spent their babyhood we all done thought wed come to school explained unc billy with a grin
im glad you did replied old mother nature you see the rest of your friends here are a little curious about the possum family meanwhile ol missus possum was climbing a tree
and when she had reached a comfortable crotch the little possums left her and began to play about in the tree it was then that it appeared what handy things those naked little tails were
when the little possums crawled out where the branches were small they simply wrapped their tails around the twigs to keep from falling my exclaimed peter
those certainly are handy tails handiest tails ever was declared unc billy
suppose you climb a tree unc billy and show your friends here how you manage to get the eggs from a nest that you cannot reach by crawling along the branch on which it is placed said old mother nature
unc billy grinned and good naturedly started up a tree he crept out on a branch that overhung another branch way out where the branch was small crept unc billy
then he wrapped the end of his tail around the branch and swung himself off keeping hold of the branch only with his tail and one hind foot then
stretching down full length he could just reach the branch below him you see he explained if there was a nest on this branch down here ah could get those eggs without any trouble
again unc billy grinned and then pulled himself back to the other branch old mother nature shook her head reprovingly unc billy said she
you are a bad old rascal to steal eggs whats more
it is a wonder that between you and chatterer the red squirrel any of the birds succeed in raising families around here have you visited farmer browns hen house lately unc billy shook his head
not lately said he ah done got a dreadful scare the last time ah was up there
where is your home asked johnny chuck i know said peter rabbit its up in a big hollow tree unc billy looked down at peter
said he are possums found anywhere except around here inquired happy jack yes indeed replied old mother nature they are found all down through the sunny south
and in the warmer parts of the middle west unc billy and his relatives are not fond of cold weather they prefer to be where they can be reasonably warm all the year round some folks think unc billy isnt smart
but those folks dont know unc billy he learned a long time ago that he cant run as fast as some others so he has learned to depend on his wits in time of danger what do you think he does i
know cried peter i saw him do it once farmer browns boy surprised unc billy and unc billy just fell right over dead pooh thats a story peter rabbit
how could unc billy have fallen over dead and be alive up in that tree this very minute cried happy jack i didnt mean he was really dead but that he looked as if he were dead explained peter
and he did too he was the deadest looking thing i ever saw i thought he was dead myself i was watching from a bramble tangle where i was hiding and i certainly thought
the life had been scared right out of unc billy i guess farmer browns boy thought so too he picked unc billy up by the tail and looked him all over and said you poor little thing
i didnt mean to hurt you unc billy didnt so much as wink an eye farmer browns boy went off up the path carrying unc billy by the tail by and by he laid unc billy down
on an old stump while he went to look at a nest of blacky the crow when he came back unc billy wasnt there i never did see unc billy hurry as he did the minute farmer browns boys back was turned
he came to life as suddenly as he had dropped dead very good peter said old mother nature some other smart little people try that trick sometimes
but none of them can do it as well as unc billy possum pretending to be dead in order to remain alive is the cleverest thing unc billy does
chapter three the awakening but warming was wrong in that an awakening came what a wonderfully complex thing this simple seeming unity
the self who can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken the flux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving rebuilding the dim first stirrings of the soul
the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to the subconscious the subconscious to dawning consciousness until at last we recognise ourselves again and as it happens to most of us after the nights sleep
so it was with graham at the end of his vast slumber a dim cloud of sensation taking shape a cloudy dreariness and he found himself vaguely somewhere recumbent faint but alive
the pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs to occupy epochs gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time
left vague perplexing memories strange creatures strange scenery as if from another planet there was a distinct impression too of a momentous conversation of a name
he could not tell what name that was subsequently to recur of some queer long forgotten sensation of vein and muscle of a feeling of vast hopeless effort
the effort of a man near drowning in darkness then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes graham became aware that his eyes were open
and regarding some unfamiliar thing it was something white the edge of something a frame of wood he moved his head slightly following the contour of this shape
it went up beyond the top of his eyes he tried to think where he might be did it matter seeing he was so wretched
he felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn he had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding
the movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness he supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley but he could not recall that white edge he must have slept
he remembered now that he had wanted to sleep he recalled the cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something about talking to a passer by how long had he slept
what was that sound of pattering feet and that rise and fall like the murmur of breakers on pebbles he put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it
and touched some smooth hard surface like glass this was so unexpected that it startled him extremely quite suddenly he rolled over stared for a moment and struggled into a sitting position
the effort was unexpectedly difficult and it left him giddy and weak and amazed he rubbed his eyes the riddle of his surroundings was confusing
but his mind was quite clear evidently his sleep had benefited him he was not in a bed at all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress
in a trough of dark glass the mattress was partly transparent a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly
about his arm and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow was bound a curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly
that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below and this bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass as it seemed to him a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention
in the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus for the most part quite strange appliances though a maximum and minimum thermometer was recognisable
the slightly greenish tint of the glass like substance which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of splendid appearance
and with a very large and simple white archway facing him close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture a table covered with a silvery cloth silvery like the side of a fish
a couple of graceful chairs and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them a bottle and two glasses he realised that he was intensely hungry he could see no one
and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apartment he had miscalculated his strength however
and staggered and put his hand against the glass like pane before him to steady himself for a moment it resisted his hand bending outward like a distended bladder then it broke with a slight report
and vanished a pricked bubble he reeled out into the general space of the hall greatly astonished he caught at the table to save himself knocking one of the glasses to the floor
it rang but did not break and sat down in one of the armchairs when he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle and drank a colourless liquid it was but not water
with a pleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus he put down the vessel and looked about him
the apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenish transparency that had intervened was removed the archway he saw led to a flight of steps going downward without the intermediation of a door
to a spacious transverse passage this passage ran between polished pillars of some white veined substance of deep ultramarine and along it came the sound of human movements
and voices and a deep undeviating droning note he sat now fully awake listening alertly forgetting the viands in his attention
then with a shock he remembered that he was naked and casting about him for covering saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him this he wrapped about him and sat down again trembling
his mind was still a surging perplexity clearly he had slept and had been removed in his sleep but where and who were those people the distant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars
boscastle he poured out and partially drank another glass of the colourless fluid what was this place this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive
he looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apartment unstained by ornament and saw that the roof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light
and as he looked a steady sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed and came again and passed beat beat that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air
he would have called out but only a little sound came into his throat then he stood up and with the uncertain steps of a drunkard made his way towards the archway he staggered down the steps
tripped on the corner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself and saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars the passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple
and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze a space like the interior of some gigantic building beyond and remote
were vast and vague architectural forms the tumult of voices rose now loud and clear and on the balcony and with their backs to him gesticulating and apparently in animated conversation
were three figures richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft colourings the noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the balcony and once it seemed
the top of a banner passed and once some brightly coloured object a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the air perhaps flashed athwart the space and fell the shouts sounded like english
there was a reiteration of wake he heard some indistinct shrill cry and abruptly these three men began laughing ha ha ha laughed one
a red haired man in a short purple robe when the sleeper wakes when he turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage his face changed the whole man changed
became rigid the other two turned swiftly at his exclamation and stood motionless their faces assumed an expression of consternation an expression that deepened into awe

chapter nine count ferralti
at dinner it was announced that the famous tarantella would be danced in the lower hall of the hotel at nine oclock and the girls told uncle john that they must not miss this famous sight which is one of the most unique in sorrento or indeed in all italy
as they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance louise gave a start of surprise
a goodly audience had already assembled in the room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her
he was a nice looking young fellow beth thought and had a foreign and quite distinguished air presently louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the gentleman to her party
introducing him to uncle john and her cousins as count ferralti whom she had once met in new york while he was on a visit to america
the count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that patsy thought affected and said in excellent english
new york adopts a good many said uncle john drily it has even been thoughtless enough to adopt me the dancers entered at that moment and the americans were forced to seat themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others
count ferralti found a place beside louise but seemed to have little to say to her during the course of the entertainment the dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troup of laughing peasants dressed in native costume
who seemed very proud of their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists present the tarantella originated in ischia but sorrento and capri have the best dancers
afterward uncle john and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of red hot scoria toward the sky
the count clung to louises side but also tried to make himself agreeable to her cousins
and beth replied that his manners were so like those of their cousin louise that the two ought to get along nicely together uncle john liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men generally to meet them
but there was something in the appearance of this callow italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial and insincere he resolved to find out something about his antecedents before he permitted the young fellow
to establish friendly relations with his girls next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel was a brother of that floriano who managed the hotel du vesuve
that gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good english and was exceedingly courteous to his guests especially when they were american
count ferralti the young man standing by the window yonder i i did not know he said hesitatingly the gentleman arrived last evening and i had not yet learned his name let me see
he turned to his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and continued
he has given his name as ferralti but added no title a count did you say yes replied uncle john the proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only was visible
then he remarked that the eruption of vesuvius was waning and the trouble nearly over for this time
that i cannot tell you signor merrick oh perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country i i know little of the nobility answered floriano indignantly
my dear signor there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all italy yet you say you dont know the ferralti family
observe signor here is our record of nobility it is the same as the blue book or the peerage of england either fortunately or unfortunately i cannot say you have no need of such a book in america
he turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of fs find me if you can a count ferralti in the list uncle john looked he put on his glasses and looked again
and no such noble family signor merrick uncle john whistled softly and walked away to the window the young man greeted him with a smile and a bow i misunderstood your name last evening he said i thought you were count ferralti
and that is right sir was the prompt reply allow me to offer you my card uncle john took the card and read conte leonardi ferralti milano italia
he carefully placed the card in his pocket book thank you said he its a fine morning count charming mister merrick uncle john walked away he was glad that he had not suspected the young man unjustly
when an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous he joined his nieces who were all busily engaged in writing letters home and remarked casually youve been deceived in your italian friend louise
he is neither a count nor of noble family although i suppose when you met him in new york he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat the girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully
has never before heard of him how singular exclaimed louise i wonder why he has tried to deceive us oh the world is full of impostors but when you are on to their game they are quite harmless
uncle john hardly knew what to say further he felt he was in an awkward position for louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian
or to deprive his girls of any passing pleasure they might enjoy moreover louise being in love with that young weldon her mother so strongly objected to
she would not be likely to care much for this italian fellow and missus merrick had enjoined him to keep her daughters mind from dwelling on her entanglement oh well my dear he said to her you must act as you see fit
i do not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event and now that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false colors you will know how to handle him better than i can advise you
said louise slowly as she resumed her writing well then girls what do you say to a stroll around the village asked their uncle im told its a proper place to buy silk stockings and inlaid wood work they come assorted i suppose
the girl who came into the world on that night when jesse ran through the fields crying to god that he be given a son had grown to womanhood on the farm
and when not angry she was often morose and silent in winesburg it was said that she drank her husband the banker
but louise could not be made happy she flew into half insane fits of temper during which she was sometimes silent sometimes noisy and quarrelsome she swore and cried out in her anger she got a knife from the kitchen and threatened her husbands life
sometimes on summer afternoons she came out of the house and got into her carriage dismissing the driver she took the reins in her own hands and drove off at top speed through the streets
to the people of the town it seemed as though she wanted to run them down when she had driven through several streets tearing around corners and beating the horses with the whip she drove off into the country on the country roads
she became thoughtful and muttered words sometimes tears came into her eyes
but for the influence of her husband and the respect he inspired in peoples minds
he was too young then to have opinions of his own about people but at times it was difficult for him not to have very definite opinions about the woman who was his mother david was always a quiet orderly boy
and for a long time was thought by the people of winesburg to be something of a dullard his eyes were brown and as a child he had a habit of looking at things and people a long time without appearing to see what he was looking at
when he heard his mother spoken of harshly or when he overheard her berating his father he was frightened and ran away to hide sometimes he could not find a hiding place and that confused him
he closed his eyes and tried not to think of anything he had a habit of talking aloud to himself and early in life a spirit of quiet sadness often took possession of him on the occasions when david went to visit his grandfather on the bentley farm
something happened to david he could not bear to go into the house where his mother and father lived and on an impulse he decided to run away from home
the boys imagination was excited and he fancied that he could see and hear strange things in the darkness into his mind came the conviction that he was walking and running in some terrible void where no one had ever been before
the darkness about him seemed limitless the sound of the wind blowing in trees was terrifying when a team of horses approached along the road in which he walked he was frightened and climbed a fence through a field he ran until he came
into another road and getting upon his knees felt of the soft ground with his fingers but for the figure of his grandfather whom he was afraid he would never find in the darkness he thought the world must be altogether empty
when his cries were heard by a farmer who was walking home from town and he was brought back to his fathers house he was so tired and excited that he did not know what was happening to him by chance davids father knew that he had disappeared
on the street he had met the farm hand from the bentley place and knew of his sons return to town when the boy did not come home an alarm was set up and john hardy with several men of the town went to search the country
the report that david had been kidnapped ran about through the streets of winesburg when he came home there were no lights in the house but his mother appeared and clutched him eagerly in her arms david thought she had suddenly become another woman
for an hour the woman sat in the darkness and held her boy all the time she kept talking in a low voice david could not understand what had so changed her her habitually dissatisfied face had become he thought
the most peaceful and lovely thing he had ever seen
on and on went her voice it was not
but she made him hide and be silent until she had sent them away he thought it must be a game his mother and the men of the town were playing with him and laughed joyously
into his mind came the thought that his having been lost and frightened in the darkness was an altogether unimportant matter
he thought that he would have been willing to go through the frightful experience a thousand times to be sure of finding at the end of the long black road a thing so lovely as his mother had suddenly become
during the last years of young davids boyhood he saw his mother but seldom and she became for him just a woman with whom he had once lived still he could not get her figure out of his mind and as he grew older it became more definite
when he was twelve years old he went to the bentley farm to live old jesse came into town and fairly demanded that he be given charge of the boy the old man was excited and determined on having his own way he talked to john hardy
it is an atmosphere not corrupted by my presence she said sharply
different with him louise turned and went out of the room leaving the two men to sit in embarrassed silence as very often happened she later stayed in her room for days
even when the boys clothes were packed and he was taken away she did not appear the loss of her son made a sharp break in her life and she seemed less inclined to quarrel with her husband john hardy thought it had all turned out very well indeed
and so young david went to live in the bentley farmhouse with jesse two of the old farmers sisters were alive and still lived in the house they were afraid of jesse and rarely spoke when he was about
one of the women who had been noted for her flaming red hair when she was younger was a born mother and became the boys caretaker every night when he had gone to bed she went into his room and sat on the floor
when he became drowsy she became bold and whispered things that he later thought he must have dreamed her soft low voice called him endearing names
and he dreamed that his mother had come to him and that she had changed so that she was always as she had been that time after he ran away he also grew bold and reaching out his hand stroked the face of the woman on the floor so that she was ecstatically happy
began to think that at last his prayers had been answered although he was at that time only fifty five years old he looked seventy and was worn out with much thinking and scheming
the effort he had made to extend his land holdings had been successful and there were few farms in the valley that did not belong to him but until david came he was a bitterly disappointed man
there were two influences at work in jesse bentley and all his life his mind had been a battleground for these influences first there was the old thing in him he wanted to be a man of god and a leader among men of god
his walking in the fields and through the forests at night had brought him close to nature and there were forces in the passionately religious man that ran out to the forces in nature the disappointment that had come to him when a daughter
but he no longer demanded such recognition instead he prayed for it sometimes he was altogether doubtful and thought god had deserted the world
he had grown into maturity in america in the years after the civil war and he like all men of his time had been touched by the deep influences that were at work in the country during those years when modern industrialism was being born
jesse formed the habit of reading newspapers and magazines he invented a machine for the making of fence out of wire faintly he realized that the atmosphere of old times and places that he had
always cultivated in his own mind was strange and foreign to the thing that was growing up in the minds of others the beginning of the most materialistic age in the history of the world when wars would be fought without patriotism when men would forget god and
only pay attention to moral standards when the will to power would replace the will to serve and beauty would be well nigh forgotten in the terrible headlong rush of mankind toward the acquiring of possessions was telling its story to jesse the man of god
as it was to the men about him the greedy thing in him wanted to make money faster than it could be made by tilling the land more than once he went into winesburg to talk with his son in law john hardy about it you are a banker and you will have chances i never had
big things are going to be done in the country
you get into it i wish i were younger and had your chance
at one time in his life he had been threatened with paralysis and his left side remained somewhat weakened as he talked his left eyelid twitched later
and the stars came out it was harder to get back the old feeling of a close and personal god who lived in the sky overhead and who might at any moment reach out his hand touch him on the shoulder
and it seemed to him that god had at last looked with favor upon him as for the boy on the farm life began to reveal itself to him in a thousand new and delightful ways the kindly attitude of all about him expanded his quiet nature
and he lost the half timid hesitating manner he had always had with his people at night when he went to bed after a long day of adventures in the stables in the fields or driving about from farm to farm with his grandfather he wanted to embrace everyone in the house
if sherley bentley the woman who came each night to sit on the floor by his bedside did not appear at once he went to the head of the stairs and shouted his young voice ringing through the narrow halls where for so long there had been a tradition of silence in the morning when he awoke and lay still in bed
the sounds that came in to him through the windows filled him with delight he thought with a shudder of the life in the house in winesburg and of his mothers angry voice that had always made him tremble there in the country all sounds were pleasant sounds
when he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also awoke in the house people stirred about eliza stoughton the half witted girl was poked in the ribs by a farm hand and giggled noisily in some distant field a cow bawled and was answered
by the cattle in the stables and one of the farm hands spoke sharply to the horse he was grooming by the stable door david leaped out of bed and ran to a window all of the people stirring about excited his mind and he wondered what his mother was doing
six seven he said slowly wetting his finger and making straight up and down marks on the window ledge david ran to put on his trousers and shirt a feverish desire to get out of doors took possession of him
when he had run through the long old house shutting the doors behind him with a bang he came into the barnyard and looked about with an amazed air of expectancy
henry strader an old man who had been on the farm since jesse came into possession and who before davids time had never been known to make a joke made the same joke every morning it amused david so that he laughed and clapped his hands
they rode in a comfortable old phaeton drawn by the white horse the old man scratched his thin white beard and talked to himself of his plans for increasing the productiveness of the fields they visited and of gods part in the plans all men made
sometimes he looked at david and smiled happily and then for a long time he appeared to forget the boys existence
when he had first come out of the city to live on the land
jesse and his grandson were driving in a distant part of the valley some miles from home a forest came down to the road and through the forest wine creek wriggled its way over stones toward a distant river
all the afternoon jesse had been in a meditative mood and now he began to talk his mind went back to the night when he had been frightened by thoughts of a giant that might come to rob and plunder him of his possessions
and again as on that night when he had run through the fields crying for a son he became excited to the edge of insanity
when a rabbit jumped up and ran away through the woods he clapped his hands and danced with delight
jesse bentley went along under the trees with his head bowed and with his mind in a ferment his earnestness affected the boy who presently became silent and a little alarmed
that the presence of the boy and man on their knees in some lonely spot in the forest would make the miracle he had been waiting for almost inevitable
it was in just such a place as this that other david tended the sheep when his father came and told him to go down unto saul he muttered
he climbed over a fallen log and when he had come to an open place among the trees he dropped upon his knees and began to pray in a loud voice a kind of terror he had never known before took possession of david
it seemed to him that he was in the presence not only of his grandfather but of someone else someone who might hurt him someone who was not kindly but dangerous and brutal
when jesse bentley absorbed in his own idea suddenly arose and advanced toward him his terror grew until his whole body shook in the woods an intense silence seemed to lie over everything and suddenly out of the silence came the old mans harsh and insistent voice
gripping the boys shoulders jesse turned his face to the sky and shouted the whole left side of his face twitched and his hand on the boys shoulder twitched also make a sign to me god he cried here i stand with the boy david
come down to me out of the sky and make thy presence known to me with a cry of fear david turned and shaking himself loose from the hands that held him ran away through the forest
the man did not look like his grandfather the conviction that something strange and terrible had happened that by some miracle a new and dangerous person had come into the body of the kindly old man took possession of him
on and on he ran down the hillside sobbing as he ran when he fell over the roots of a tree and in falling struck his head
and he awoke to find the old mans hand stroking his head tenderly that the terror left him
chapter eighteen grave questions
and barbicane and his two companions watched with scrupulous attention the brilliant rays which the celebrated mountain shed so curiously over the horizon what was this radiant glory what
some twelve miles others thirty miles broad
and seemed to cover particularly toward the east the northeast and the north the half of the southern hemisphere one of these jets extended as far as the circle of neander situated on the fortieth meridian
another by a slight curve furrowed the sea of nectar breaking against
with a luminous network what was the origin of these sparkling rays which shone on the plains as well as on the reliefs at whatever height they might be all started from a common center the crater
they sprang from him herschel attributed their brilliancy to currents of lava congealed by the cold an opinion however which has not been generally adopted
because the regularity of these luminous lines and the violence necessary to carry volcanic matter to such distances is inexplicable
by jove replied michel ardan
indeed said barbicane indeed continued michel it is enough to say
well replied barbicane smiling and what hand would be powerful enough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that the hand is not necessary answered nicholl not at all confounded
the shock which produced that rent
a contraction something like a lunar stomach ache said michel ardan besides added barbicane this opinion is that of an english savant
that nasmyth was no fool replied michel
their projectile saturated with luminous gleams in the double irradiation of sun and moon must have appeared like an incandescent globe
to intense heat nature was thus preparing them to become selenites become selenites that idea brought up once more the question of the habitability of the moon after what they had seen could the travelers solve it
would they decide for or against it michel ardan persuaded his two friends to form an opinion and asked them directly if they thought that men and animals were represented in the lunar world
i think that we can answer said barbicane but according to my idea the question ought not to be put in that form i ask it to be put differently put it your own way replied michel
here it is continued barbicane the problem is a double one and requires a double solution is the moon habitable has the moon ever been inhabitable good
replied nicholl first let us see whether the moon is habitable to tell the truth i know nothing about it answered michel and i answer in the negative continued barbicane
in her actual state with her surrounding atmosphere certainly very much reduced her seas for the most part dried up her insufficient supply of water restricted vegetation sudden alternations of cold and heat
her days and nights of three hundred fifty four hours the moon does not seem habitable to me nor does she seem propitious to animal development nor sufficient for the wants of existence as we understand it
agreed replied nicholl but is not the moon habitable for creatures differently organized from ourselves
seemed to us to move on the moons surface
and what have we seen everywhere and always the geological works of nature never the work of man if then there exist representatives of the animal kingdom on the moon
they must have fled to those unfathomable cavities which the eye cannot reach which i cannot admit for they must have left traces of their passage on those plains which the atmosphere must cover however slightly raised it may be
these traces are nowhere visible there remains but one hypothesis that of a living race to which motion which is life is foreign one might as well say living creatures which do not live replied michel
the scientific commission assembled in the projectile of the gun club after having founded their argument on facts recently observed decide unanimously upon the question of the habitability of the moon no the moon
said nicholl let us attack the second question an indispensable complement of the first i ask the honorable commission if the moon is not habitable has she ever been inhabited citizen barbicane
my friends replied barbicane i did not undertake this journey in order to form an opinion on the past habitability of our satellite but i will add that our personal observations only confirm me in this opinion
i believe indeed i affirm that the moon has been inhabited by a human race organized like our own that she has produced animals anatomically formed like the terrestrial animals
but i add that these races human and animal have had their day and are now forever extinct
relatively the organizing force of matter has been much more violent in the interior of the moon than in the interior of the terrestrial globe the actual state of this cracked twisted and burst disc abundantly proves this
the moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous masses originally
continued barbicane an atmosphere surrounded it
for example its days and nights of three hundred fifty four hours at the terrestrial poles they last six months said michel an argument of little value since the poles are not inhabited let us observe my friends continued barbicane
that if in the actual state of the moon its long nights and long days created differences of temperature insupportable to organization it was not so at the historical period of time the atmosphere enveloped the disc with a fluid mantle
vapor deposited itself in the shape of clouds this natural screen tempered the ardor of the solar rays and retained the nocturnal radiation
light like heat can diffuse itself in the air hence an equality between the influences which no longer exists now that atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared and now i am going to astonish you
astonish us said michel ardan i firmly believe that at the period when the moon was inhabited the nights and days did not last three hundred fifty four hours and why
asked nicholl quickly because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis was not equal to her revolution an equality which presents each part of her disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays
granted replied nicholl but why should not these two motions have been equal as they are really so because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial attraction
and who can say that this attraction was powerful enough to alter the motion of the moon at that period when the earth was still fluid just so replied nicholl and who can say that the moon has always been a satellite of the earth
exclaimed michel ardan that the moon did not exist before the earth their imaginations carried them away into an indefinite field of hypothesis barbicane sought to restrain them
those speculations are too high said he problems utterly insoluble
let us only admit the insufficiency of the primordial attraction and then by the inequality of the two motions of rotation and revolution
besides even without these conditions life was possible and so asked michel ardan humanity has disappeared from the moon yes replied barbicane
after having doubtless remained persistently for millions of centuries
as the terrestrial globe will one day become by cooling by cooling certainly replied barbicane as the internal fires became extinguished
and the incandescent matter concentrated itself the lunar crust cooled by degrees the consequences of these phenomena showed themselves in the disappearance of organized beings and by the disappearance of vegetation soon the atmosphere was rarefied
probably withdrawn by terrestrial attraction then aerial departure of respirable air and disappearance of water by means of evaporation at this period the moon becoming uninhabitable was no longer inhabited it was a dead world
and have they calculated the time which our unfortunate sphere will take to cool certainly and you know these calculations perfectly
but speak then my clumsy savant exclaimed michel ardan for you make me boil with impatience very well my good michel replied barbicane quietly we know what diminution of temperature the earth undergoes in the lapse of a century
be brought down to zero four hundred thousand years exclaimed michel ah i breathe again really i was frightened to hear you i imagined that we had not more than fifty thousand years to live
barbicane and nicholl could not help laughing at their companions uneasiness
which had just been considered again has the moon been inhabited he asked the answer was unanimously in the affirmative but during this discussion fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories
the projectile was rapidly leaving the moon the lineaments faded away from the travelers eyes mountains were confused in the distance and of all the wonderful strange and fantastical form of the earths satellite there soon remained nothing
but as sure as he found a princess he found some fault in her of course he could not marry a mere woman however beautiful and there was no princess to be found worthy of him
whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself i cannot pretend to say all i know is that he was a fine handsome
brave generous well bred and well behaved youth as all princes are in his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess
he never dreamed that she could bewitch him for what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity who could tell what she might not lose next she might lose her visibility or her tangibility
or in short the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive of course he made no further inquiries about her
one day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest these forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers like a sieve that keeps back the bran then the princes get away to follow their fortunes
in this way they have the advantage of the princesses who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun i wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes one lovely evening after wandering about for many days
he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them and he soon came upon a kind of heath next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood
at length he entered another wood not a wild forest but a civilized wood through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness
suddenly he paused and listened strange sounds came across the water it was in fact the princess laughing now there was something odd in her laugh as i have already hinted
for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming looking over the lake he saw something white in the water and in an instant he had torn off his tunic
now i cannot tell how it came about whether she pretended to be drowning or whether he frightened her or caught her so as to embarrass her but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer
and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak at the place to which he bore her the bank was only a foot or two above the water
so he gave her a strong lift out of the water to lay her on the bank but her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water away she went up into the air scolding and screaming
you naughty naughty naughty naughty man she cried no one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before when the prince saw her ascend he thought he must have been bewitched
the prince meantime stood in the water staring and forgetting to get out but the princess disappearing he scrambled on shore and went in the direction of the tree
until reaching the ground and seeing him standing there she caught hold of him and said ill tell papa oh no you wont returned the prince yes i will she persisted
what business had you to pull me down out of the water and throw me to the bottom of the air i never did you any harm pardon me i did not mean to hurt you i dont believe you have any brains and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity
i pity you the prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess and had already offended her but before he could think what to say next she burst out angrily giving a stamp with her foot
that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm put me up directly put you up where you beauty asked the prince he had fallen in love with her almost already
for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her and as far as he could see which certainly was not far she had not a single fault about her except of course that she had not any gravity
no prince however would judge of a princess by weight the loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud put you up where you beauty asked the prince in the water you stupid
answered the princess come then said the prince the condition of her dress increasing her usual difficulty in walking compelled her to cling to him and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream
he turned towards the princess and said how am i to put you in that is your business she answered quite snappishly
very well said the prince and catching her up in his arms he sprang with her from the rock the princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them
it seemed to me like going up rejoined she my feeling was certainly one of elevation too the prince conceded the princess did not appear to understand him for she retorted his question
said the princess beyond everything answered he for i have fallen in with the only perfect creature i ever saw no more of that i am tired of it said the princess perhaps she shared her fathers aversion to punning
dont you like falling in then said the prince it is the most delightful fun i ever had in my life answered she i never fell before i wish i could learn
to think i am the only person in my fathers kingdom that cant fall here the poor princess looked almost sad i shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like said the prince devotedly thank you
i dont know perhaps it would not be proper but i dont care at all events as we have fallen in let us have a swim together with all my heart responded the prince
and away they went swimming and diving and floating until at last they heard cries along the shore and saw lights glancing in all directions it was now quite late and there was no moon i must go home said the princess
at least i dont exactly know where it is i wish i hadnt one either rejoined the princess it is so stupid i have a great mind she continued to play them all a trick why couldnt they leave me alone
they wont trust me in the lake for a single night you see where that green light is burning that is the window of my room now if you would just swim there with me very quietly and when we are all but under the balcony
as you did a little while ago i should be able to catch hold of the balcony and get in at the window and then they may look for me till to morrow morning with more obedience than pleasure said the prince gallantly and away they swam very gently
will you be in the lake to morrow night the prince ventured to ask to be sure i will i dont think so perhaps was the princesss somewhat strange answer
and merely whispered as he gave her the parting lift dont tell the only answer the princess returned was a roguish look she was already a yard above his head the look seemed to say never fear it is too good fun to spoil that way
so perfectly like other people had she been in the water that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly grasp the balcony and disappear through the window
he turned almost expecting to see her still by his side but he was alone in the water so he swam away quietly and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber
as soon as they disappeared he landed in search of his tunic and sword and after some trouble found them again then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side there the wood was wilder
and the shore steeper rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night and all night long he soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princesss room
and where even in the broad daylight he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore it was a sort of cave in the rock where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake
this is very kind of you the prince went to dress for the occasion for he was resolved to die like a prince when the princess heard that a man had offered to die for her
she was so transported that she jumped off the bed feeble as she was and danced about the room for joy she did not care who the man was that was nothing to her the hole wanted stopping and if only a man would do why take one
where they had already placed a little boat for her the water was not deep enough to float it but they hoped it would be before long they laid her on cushions placed in the boat wines and fruits and other nice things and stretched a canopy over all
in a few minutes the prince appeared the princess recognized him at once but did not think it worth while to acknowledge him here i am said the prince put me in
they told me it was a shoeblack said the princess so i am said the prince i blacked your little boots three times a day because they were all i could get of you put me in
the courtiers did not resent his bluntness except by saying to each other that he was taking it out in impudence but how was he to be put in the golden plate contained no instructions on this point
the prince looked at the hole and saw but one way he put both his legs into it sitting on the stone and stooping forward covered the corner that remained open with his two hands in this uncomfortable position
he resolved to abide his fate and turning to the people said now you can go the king had already gone home to dinner now you can go repeated the princess after him like a parrot
the people obeyed her and went presently a little wave flowed over the stone and wetted one of the princes knees but he did not mind it much
and a long pause followed this is very kind of you prince said the princess at last quite coolly as she lay in the boat with her eyes shut i am sorry i cant return the compliment
thought the prince but you are worth dying for after all again a wavelet and another and another flowed over the stone and wetted both the princes knees but he did not speak or move
two three four hours passed in this way the princess apparently asleep and the prince very patient but he was much disappointed in his position for he had none of the consolation he had hoped for
at last he could bear it no longer princess said he but at the moment up started the princess crying im afloat im afloat and the little boat bumped against the stone princess
repeated the prince encouraged by seeing her wide awake and looking eagerly at the water well said she without looking round
and you havent looked at me once did he then i suppose i must but i am so sleepy sleep then darling and dont mind me said the poor prince
replied the princess i think i will go to sleep again just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit first said the prince very humbly with all my heart said the princess and gaped as she said it
feeling very faint indeed only i shall die before it is of any use to you unless i have something to eat there then said she holding out the wine to him ah you must feed me i dare not move my hands
and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit and sips of wine as she fed him he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then she did not seem to mind it one way or the other but the prince felt better
now for your own sake princess said he i cannot let you go to sleep you must sit and look at me else i shall not be able to keep up well i will do anything i can to oblige you
answered she with condescension and sitting down she did look at him and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness considering all things the sun went down and the moon rose
and gush after gush the waters were rising up the princes body they were up to his waist now why cant we go and have a swim said the princess
i shall never swim more said the prince oh i forgot said the princess and was silent so the water grew and grew and rose up and up on the prince
and the princess sat and looked at him she fed him now and then the night wore on the waters rose and rose the moon rose likewise higher and higher
and shone full on the face of the dying prince the water was up to his neck will you kiss me princess said he feebly the nonchalance was all gone now
yes i will answered the princess and kissed him with a long sweet cold kiss now said he with a sigh of content i die happy
he did not speak again the princess gave him some wine for the last time he was past eating then she sat down again and looked at him the water rose and rose
it touched his chin it touched his lower lip it touched between his lips he shut them hard to keep it out the princess began to feel strange it touched his upper lip
he breathed through his nostrils the princess looked wild it covered his nostrils her eyes looked scared and shone strange in the moonlight his head fell back the water closed over it
and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water the princess gave a shriek and sprang into the lake she laid hold first of one leg and then of the other and pulled and tugged but she could not move either she stopped to take breath
and that made her think that he could not get any breath she was frantic she got hold of him and held his head above the water which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole but it was of no use for he was past breathing
love and water brought back all her strength she got under the water and pulled and pulled with her whole might till at last she got one leg out the other easily followed how she got him into the boat she never could tell
but when she did she fainted away coming to herself she seized the oars kept herself steady as best she could and rowed and rowed though she had never rowed before round rocks and over shallows and through mud she rowed
till she got to the landing stairs of the palace by this time her people were on the shore for they had heard her shriek she made them carry the prince to her own room and lay him in her bed and light a fire and send for the doctors
but the lake your highness said the chamberlain who roused by the noise came in in his nightcap go and drown yourself in it she said this was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty
and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain had it been the king himself he would have fared no better but both he and the queen were fast asleep and the chamberlain went back to his bed
somehow the doctors never came so the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince but the old nurse was a wise woman and knew what to do they tried everything for a long time without success
the princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear but she tried on and on one thing after another and everything over and over again at last when they had all but given it up just as the sun rose
but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match
cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship this advice was well received the old woman approved it
they said not a word to his sister the thing was executed for a little money and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit and punishing the pride of a german baron
it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married and living with the philosopher pangloss the philosopher martin the prudent cacambo and the old woman
having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas must have led a very happy life but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm
his wife became uglier every day more peevish and unsupportable the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde cacambo who worked in the garden and took vegetables for sale to constantinople
and they saw other cadis pashas and effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles and afterwards exiled in their turn they saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the sublime porte
i want to know which is worse to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates
in short to go through all the miseries we have undergone or to stay here and have nothing to do
this discourse gave rise to new reflections and martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust
pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well he asserted it still though he no longer believed it what helped to confirm martin in his detestable principles
they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres parted were reconciled quarrelled again
that your presents would soon be dissipated and only make them the more miserable you have rolled in millions of money you and cacambo
ha said pangloss to paquette providence has then brought you amongst us again my poor child do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose an eye and an ear as you may see what a world is this
and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever in the neighbourhood there lived a very famous dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all turkey and they went to consult him pangloss was the speaker
master said he we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man was made with what meddlest thou said the dervish is it thy business
there is horrible evil in this world what signifies it said the dervish whether there be evil or good when his highness sends a ship to egypt does he trouble his head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not
what then must we do said pangloss hold your tongue answered the dervish i was in hopes said pangloss that i should reason with you a little about causes and effects about the best of possible worlds the origin of evil the nature of the soul
and the pre established harmony at these words the dervish shut the door in their faces during this conversation the news was spread that two viziers and the mufti had been strangled at constantinople and that several of their friends had been impaled
asked the old man what was the name of the strangled mufti i do not know answered the worthy man and i have not known the name of any mufti nor of any vizier i am entirely ignorant of the event you mention
i presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably and that they deserve it but i never trouble my head about what is transacting at constantinople
i content myself with sending there for sale the fruits of the garden which i cultivate having said these words he invited the strangers into his house his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet which they made themselves
with kaimak enriched with the candied peel of citrons with oranges lemons pine apples pistachio nuts and mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of batavia or the american islands
you must have a vast and magnificent estate said candide to the turk i have only twenty acres replied the old man i and my children cultivate them our labour preserves us from three great evils weariness vice and want
made profound reflections on the old mans conversation this honest turk said he to pangloss and martin seems to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honour of supping
grandeur said pangloss is extremely dangerous according to the testimony of philosophers for in short eglon king of moab was assassinated by ehud absalom was hung by his hair and pierced with three darts
king nadab the son of jeroboam was killed by baasa
athaliah by jehoiada the kings jehoiakim jeconiah and zedekiah were led into captivity
dionysius of syracuse pyrrhus perseus hannibal jugurtha ariovistus caesar pompey nero otho vitellius domitian
that we must cultivate our garden you are right said pangloss for when man was first placed in the garden of eden he was put there ut operaretur eum that he might cultivate it which shows that man was not born to be idle
let us work said martin without disputing it is the only way to render life tolerable the whole little society entered into this laudable design according to their different abilities their little plot of land produced plentiful crops
but she became an excellent pastry cook
the old woman looked after the linen
for he made a good joiner and became a very honest man
there is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds
if you had not been put into the inquisition if you had not walked over america if you had not stabbed the baron if you had not lost all your sheep from the fine country of el dorado you would not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio nuts
popes iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken a hand was laid with a powerful pressure on his arm and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear the hurons are dogs
the sight of a cowards blood can never make a warrior tremble the gray head and the sagamore are safe
go uncas and the open hand are now strangers it is enough
but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity he quitted the place and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh
the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge and exhibited the figure of uncas
after this termination of the scene duncan wandered among the lodges unquestioned and unnoticed endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran
he retraced his steps to the council lodge resolved to seek and question david in order to put an end to his doubts on reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution
though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character and the suspicious circumstances of his visit it produced no visible sensation so far the terrible scene that had just occurred
proved favorable to his views and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage without seeming to hesitate
he walked into the lodge and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that though uncas still remained where he had left him
david had not reappeared no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron who had placed himself at hand though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway
in every other respect the captive seemed at liberty still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition
he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal unfortunately for this prudent resolution his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed
he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade when another of the elder warriors who spoke the french language addressed him my canada father does not forget his children said the chief
i thank him an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men can the cunning stranger frighten him away heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the indians
in the cases of such supposed visitations he saw at a glance that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends it would therefore have been difficult just then to have uttered a proposal
that would have given him more satisfaction aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character however he repressed his feelings and answered with suitable mystery spirits differ
the huron was content with the assurance and resuming his pipe he awaited the proper moment to move the impatient heyward inwardly execrating the cold customs of the savages
equal to that maintained by the chief who was in truth a near relative of the afflicted woman the minutes lingered and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism when the huron laid aside his pipe
and drew his robe across his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid just then a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door and stalking silently among the attentive group
he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua
several pipes that had been extinguished were lighted again
drew his tomahawk from his girdle and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle
ten minutes which appeared so many ages to duncan might have passed in this manner and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke
has my friend found the moose the young men stagger under their burdens returned magua let reed that bends go on the hunting path he will meet them a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name
as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant the smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies
leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes
the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth
suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white headed savage
like most around him for more than a minute his look too was on the ground but trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention
then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence it was a lie he said i had no son he who was called by that name is forgotten
the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw
he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself i have done the speaker who was the father of the recreant young indian looked round and about him
the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastful language
standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph he turned away as if sickening at the gaze of men and veiling his face in his blanket he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking
in the privacy of his own abode the sympathy of one like himself aged forlorn and childless the indians who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects in character
suffered him to depart in silence then with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men
but who has ever found a huron asleep the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed the delawares of the lakes
not so they who wear the petticoats of squaws on their own river one of them has been passing the tribe did my young men take his scalp
brief i pray for you for you see tis a busy time with me much ado about nothing the tribe or rather half tribe of delawares
could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting grounds of the mohawks
though they had seen fit with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally
in various ways it was the prevalent opinion however
that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity
that their hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend than by any acts of ill judged severity to convert him into an open enemy
on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
the women ran from lodge to lodge
a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends the warriors were lounging in groups
the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements
when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously
as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village
he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of amity
by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall impressively on his breast
fortified by these assurances the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace
he made as he advanced many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present enterprise of no importance
his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action
one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines the wise huron is welcome said the delaware
composed of cracked corn and beans it is much used also by the whites by corn is meant maise
he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once more exchanged friendly salutations
then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old men walked calmly away
leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word during the short and frugal repast that followed
and related entirely to the events of the hunt in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware
is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children
when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most beloved the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false and continued
the tomahawks of your young men have been very red it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yengeese are dead and the delawares are our neighbors
the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection by the allusion to the massacre demanded
does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers she is welcome the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother
she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more emphatically the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently indifferent however to the repulse he had received
in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts he at length continued
it is well justice is the master of a red skin why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers
good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time
to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares before he added have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my brothers scented the feet of white men
let my canada father come returned the other evasively his children are ready to see him when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome
but the yengeese have long arms and legs that never tire
it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said magua once more shifting his ground
and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry
in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors
compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity
so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of those he addressed this well judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results
my brother is a wise chief he is welcome the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why should they not they are colored by the same sun and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death
the red skins should be friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother scented spies in the woods the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart
an appellation that the french had translated into le coeur dur forgot that obduracy of purpose
would the yengeese send their women as spies did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts
then they fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends their minds are turned from their canada father this insinuation was a home thrust
would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist the recent defection of the tribe had as they well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies
and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee
that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements their distant villages their hunting grounds
together with a material part of their physical force were actually within the limits of the french territory accordingly this alarming annunciation was received as magua intended
with manifest disapprobation if not with alarm
he will see no change it is true my young men did not go out on the war path they had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white chief
will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the camp of his children
that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares go my great canada father is not a fool
la longue carabine the delaware warriors started at the well known name betraying by their amazement that they now learned for the first time one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power
what does my brother mean demanded le coeur dur in a tone that by its wonder far exceeded the usual apathy of his race a huron never lies returned magua coldly
a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe as warrior after warrior dropped in
the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors
the boys deserted their sports and walking fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe
in short every occupation was abandoned for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open expression of feeling
the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment
magua had not only maintained his seat but the very attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge
and apparently as unconcerned as if he had no interest in the result
escaped his vigilant eyes
he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might almost be said
and formal assemblage of the nation as such meetings were rare and only called on occasions of the last importance the subtle huron who still sat apart
now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue
in front of the encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect it might have been half an hour before each individual including even the women and children was in his place
the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain
its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls
standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion
until such a one chose to make some movement no deeds in arms no natural gifts nor any renown as an orator
on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause
that always preceded a conference but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an eye was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached but one in the center who leaned on his companions for support
had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain his frame which had once been tall and erect like the cedar was now bending under the pressure of more than a century
the elastic light step of an indian was gone and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders
since they had last been shorn the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people he might very properly be termed
was rich and imposing though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe his robe was of the finest skins which had been deprived of their fur
of various deeds in arms done in former ages his bosom was loaded with medals some in massive silver and one or two even in gold
he also wore armlets and cinctures above the ankles of the latter precious metal
in touching contrast to the color of his snow white locks his tomahawk was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure
which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware
with the great spirit and which has since transmitted his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his ancient territory
the huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out a little from the throng
whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes
the americans sometimes called their tutelar saint tamenay a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced
the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions
with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father
who belongs rather to another world than to this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause
and approaching the patriarch they placed his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh his person
so just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness
the chiefs drew back again to their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment
arose left the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning
escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a lane and when the party had re entered
snow white rose red just before thanksgiving the affairs of the simpsons reached what might have been called a crisis even in their family
which had been born and reared in a state of adventurous poverty and perilous uncertainty riverboro was doing its best to return the entire tribe of simpsons to the land of its fathers so to speak
thinking rightly that the town which had given them birth rather than the town of their adoption should feed them and keep a roof over their heads until the children were of an age for self support there was little to eat in the household
and less to wear though missus simpson did as always her poor best the children managed to satisfy their appetites by sitting modestly outside their neighbors kitchen doors when meals were about to be served
they were not exactly popular favorites but they did receive certain undesirable morsels from the more charitable housewives life was rather dull and dreary however and in the chill and gloom of november weather
with the vision of other peoples turkeys bursting with fat and other peoples golden pumpkins and squashes and corn being garnered into barns the young simpsons groped about for some inexpensive form of excitement
and settled upon the selling of soap for a premium they had sold enough to their immediate neighbors during the earlier autumn to secure a childs handcart which though very weak on its pins could be trundled over the country roads
with large business sagacity and an executive capacity which must have been inherited from their father they now proposed to extend their operations to a larger area and distribute soap to contiguous villages
if these villages could be induced to buy the excelsior soap company paid a very small return of any kind to its infantile agents who were scattered through the state but it inflamed their imaginations by the issue of circulars
with highly colored pictures of the premiums to be awarded for the sale of a certain number of cakes it was at this juncture that clara belle and susan simpson consulted rebecca who threw herself solidly and wholeheartedly into the enterprise
promising her help and that of emma jane perkins the premiums within their possible grasp were three a bookcase a plush reclining chair and a banquet lamp of course the simpsons had no books
and casting aside without thought or pang the plush chair
not counting mister simpson who ordinarily sat elsewhere at the towns expense they warmed themselves rapturously in the vision of the banquet lamp which speedily became to them more desirable than food drink or clothing
neither emma jane nor rebecca perceived anything incongruous in the idea of the simpsons striving for a banquet lamp they looked at the picture daily and knew that if they themselves were free agents they would toil suffer
ay sweat for the happy privilege of occupying the same room with that lamp through the coming winter evenings it looked to be about eight feet tall in the catalogue and emma jane advised clara belle to measure the height of the simpson ceilings
but a note in the margin of the circular informed them that it stood two and a half feet high when set up in all its dignity and splendor on a proper table three dollars extra it was only of polished brass continued the circular
though it was invariably mistaken for solid gold and the shade that accompanied it at least it accompanied it if the agent sold a hundred extra cakes was of crinkled crepe paper printed in a dozen delicious hues
from which the joy dazzled agent might take his choice seesaw simpson was not in the syndicate clara belle was rather a successful agent but susan who could only say thoap never made large returns
and the twins who were somewhat young to be thoroughly trustworthy could be given only a half dozen cakes at a time and were obliged to carry with them on their business trips a brief document stating the price per cake dozen and box
rebecca and emma jane offered to go two or three miles in some one direction and see what they could do in the way of stirring up a popular demand for the snow white and rose red brands the former being devoted to laundry purposes
and the latter being intended for the toilet there was a great amount of hilarity in the preparation for this event and a long council in emma janes attic they had the soap companys circular from which to arrange a proper speech
and they had what was still better the remembrance of a certain patent medicine venders discourse at the milltown fair his method when once observed could never be forgotten nor his manner nor his vocabulary
emma jane practiced it on rebecca and rebecca on emma jane can i sell you a little soap this afternoon it is called the snow white and rose red soap
six cakes in an ornamental box only twenty cents for the white twenty five cents for the red it is made from the purest ingredients and if desired could be eaten by an invalid with relish and profit
oh rebecca dont lets say that interposed emma jane hysterically it makes me feel like a fool it takes so little to make you feel like a fool emma jane rebuked rebecca that sometimes i think that you must be one
i dont get to feeling like a fool so awfully easy now leave out that eating part if you dont like it and go on the snow white is probably the most remarkable laundry soap ever manufactured
immerse the garments in a tub lightly rubbing the more soiled portions with the soap leave them submerged in water from sunset to sunrise and then the youngest baby can wash them without the slightest effort
babe not baby corrected rebecca from the circular its just the same thing argued emma jane of course its just the same thing but a baby has got to be called babe or infant in a circular
the same as it is in poetry would you rather say infant no grumbled emma jane infant is worse even than babe
and let elijah or elisha try the soap before we begin selling i cant imagine a babe doing a family wash with any soap answered rebecca but it must be true or they would never dare to print it so dont lets bother
oh wont it be the greatest fun emma jane at some of the houses where they cant possibly know me i shant be frightened and i shall reel off the whole rigmarole invalid babe and all
perhaps i shall say even the last sentence if i can remember it we sound every chord in the great mac ro cosm of satisfaction
this conversation took place on a friday afternoon at emma janes house where rebecca to her unbounded joy was to stay over sunday her aunts having gone to portland to the funeral of an old friend
saturday being a holiday they were going to have the old white horse drive to north riverboro three miles away eat a twelve oclock dinner with emma janes cousins and be back at four oclock punctually
when the children asked missus perkins if they could call at just a few houses coming and going and sell a little soap for the simpsons she at first replied decidedly in the negative
she was an indulgent parent however and really had little objection to emma jane amusing herself in this unusual way it was only for rebecca as the niece of the difficult miranda sawyer that she raised scruples
but when fully persuaded that the enterprise was a charitable one she acquiesced the girls called at mister watsons store and arranged for several large boxes of soap to be charged to clara belle simpsons account
these were lifted into the back of the wagon and a happier couple never drove along the country road than rebecca and her companion it was a glorious indian summer day which suggested nothing of thanksgiving near at hand as it was
it was a rustly day a scarlet and buff yellow and carmine bronze and crimson day there were still many leaves on the oaks and maples making a goodly show of red and brown and gold
the air was like sparkling cider and every field had its heaps of yellow and russet good things to eat all ready for the barns the mills and the markets the horse forgot his twenty years
sniffed the sweet bright air and trotted like a colt nokomis mountain looked blue and clear in the distance rebecca stood in the wagon and apostrophized the landscape with sudden joy of living
great wide beautiful wonderful world with the wonderful water round you curled and the wonderful grass upon your breast world you are beautifully drest
dull emma jane had never seemed to rebecca so near so dear so tried and true and rebecca to emma janes faithful heart had never been so brilliant so bewildering so fascinating as in this visit together
with its intimacy its freedom and the added delights of an exciting business enterprise a gorgeous leaf blew into the wagon does color make you sort of dizzy asked rebecca
no it dont not a mite perhaps dizzy isnt just the right word but its nearest id like to eat color and drink it and sleep in it if you could be a tree which one would you choose
emma jane had enjoyed considerable experience of this kind and rebecca had succeeded in unstopping her ears ungluing her eyes and loosening her tongue so that she could play the game after a fashion
id rather be an apple tree in blossom that one that blooms pink by our pig pen rebecca laughed there was always something unexpected in emma janes replies
id choose to be that scarlet maple just on the edge of the pond there and she pointed with the whip then i could see so much more than your pink apple tree by the pig pen i could look at all the rest of the woods
see my scarlet dress in my beautiful looking glass and watch all the yellow and brown trees growing upside down in the water when im old enough to earn money im going to have a dress like this leaf
then i think ill have a brown sash like the trunk of the tree and where could i be green do they have green petticoats i wonder id like a green petticoat coming out now and then underneath
to show what my leaves were like before i was a scarlet maple i think it would be awful homely said emma jane
with a pink sash pink stockings bronze slippers
they did not accompany each other to the doors of their chosen victims feeling sure that together they could not approach the subject seriously but they parted at the gate of each house the one holding the horse while the other took the soap samples
and interviewed any one who seemed of a coming on disposition emma jane had disposed of three single cakes rebecca of three small boxes for a difference in their ability to persuade the public was clearly defined at the start
though neither of them ascribed either success or defeat to anything but the imperious force of circumstances housewives looked at emma jane and desired no soap listened to her description of its merits and still desired none
other stars in their courses governed rebeccas doings the people whom she interviewed either remembered their present need of soap or reminded themselves that they would need it in the future the notable point in the case being
that lucky rebecca accomplished with almost no effort results that poor little emma jane failed to attain by hard and conscientious labor its your turn rebecca and im glad too said emma jane
drawing up to a gateway and indicating a house that was set a considerable distance from the road i havent got over trembling from the last place yet a lady had put her head out of an upstairs window and called
go away little girl whatever you have in your box we dont want any i dont know who lives here and the blinds are all shut in front if theres nobody at home you mustnt count it but take the next house as yours
rebecca walked up the lane and went to the side door there was a porch there and seated in a rocking chair husking corn was a good looking young man or was he middle aged rebecca could not make up her mind
at all events he had an air of the city about him well shaven face well trimmed mustache well fitting clothes rebecca was a trifle shy at this unexpected encounter but there was nothing to be done but explain her presence
so she asked is the lady of the house at home i am the lady of the house at present said the stranger with a whimsical smile what can i do for you have you ever heard of the would you like or i mean
do you need any soap queried rebecca do i look as if i did he responded unexpectedly rebecca dimpled i didnt mean that i have some soap to sell
i mean i would like to introduce to you a very remarkable soap the best now on the market it is called the oh i must know that soap said the gentleman genially made out of pure vegetable fats isnt it
the very purest corroborated rebecca no acid in it not a trace and yet a child could do the monday washing with it and use no force a babe corrected rebecca
wise child this was great good fortune to find a customer who knew all the virtues of the article in advance rebecca dimpled more and more and at her new friends invitation sat down on a stool at his side near the edge of the porch
and the prices of both that and the snow white were unfolded presently she forgot all about her silent partner at the gate and was talking as if she had known this grand personage all her life
im keeping house to day but i dont live here explained the delightful gentleman im just on a visit to my aunt who has gone to portland i used to be here as a boy and i am very fond of the spot
i dont think anything takes the place of the farm where one lived when one was a child observed rebecca nearly bursting with pride at having at last successfully used the indefinite pronoun in general conversation
so you consider your childhood a thing of the past do you young lady i can still remember it answered rebecca gravely though it seems a long time ago
i can remember mine well enough and a particularly unpleasant one it was said the stranger so was mine sighed rebecca what was your worst trouble lack of food and clothes principally
oh exclaimed rebecca sympathetically mine was no shoes and too many babies and not enough books but youre all right and happy now arent you she asked doubtfully for though he looked handsome well fed and prosperous
any child could see that his eyes were tired and his mouth was sad when he was not speaking im doing pretty well thank you said the man with a delightful smile
how much has your aunt on hand now suggested the very modest and inexperienced agent and how much would she need
im not certain said rebecca conscientiously but ill look in the circular its sure to tell and she drew the document from her pocket what are you going to do with the magnificent profits you get from this business
we are not selling for our own benefit said rebecca confidentially my friend who is holding the horse at the gate is the daughter of a very rich blacksmith and doesnt need any money
we are trying to get a premium for some friends of ours rebecca had never thought of alluding to the circumstances with her previous customers but unexpectedly she found herself describing mister simpson missus simpson and the simpson family
their poverty their joyless life and their abject need of a banquet lamp to brighten their existence you neednt argue that point laughed the man as he stood up to get a glimpse of the rich blacksmiths daughter at the gate
i can see that they ought to have it if they want it and especially if you want them to have it ive known what it was myself to do without a banquet lamp now give me the circular and lets do some figuring how much do the simpsons lack at this moment
if they sell two hundred more cakes this month and next they can have the lamp by christmas rebecca answered and they can get a shade by summer time but im afraid i cant help very much after to day because my aunt miranda may not like to have me
i see well thats all right ill take three hundred cakes and that will give them shade and all
tipped over and disappeared into a clump of lilac bushes it was a very short distance fortunately and the amused capitalist picked her up set her on her feet and brushed her off you should never seem surprised when you have taken a large order said he
you ought to have replied cant you make it three hundred and fifty instead of capsizing in that unbusinesslike way oh i could never say anything like that exclaimed rebecca who was blushing crimson at her awkward fall
but it doesnt seem right for you to buy so much are you sure you can afford it
what if your aunt shouldnt like the kind of soap queried rebecca nervously my aunt always likes what i like he returned mine doesnt exclaimed rebecca then theres something wrong with your aunt or with me laughed rebecca
what is your name young lady rebecca rowena randall sir what with an amused smile both your mother was generous she couldnt bear to give up either of the names she says
i think i know already answered rebecca with a bright glance im sure you must be mister aladdin in the arabian nights oh please can i run down and tell emma jane she must be so tired waiting and she will be so glad
at the mans nod of assent rebecca sped down the lane
oh emma jane emma jane we are sold out mister aladdin followed smilingly to corroborate this astonishing unbelievable statement lifted all their boxes from the back of the wagon
and taking the circular promised to write to the excelsior company that night concerning the premium if you could contrive to keep a secret you two little girls
it would be rather a nice surprise to have the lamp arrive at the simpsons on thanksgiving day wouldnt it he asked as he tucked the old lap robe cosily over their feet
oh dont mention it laughed mister aladdin lifting his hat i was a sort of commercial traveler myself once years ago and i like to see the thing well done good by miss rebecca rowena
just let me know whenever you have anything to sell for im certain beforehand i shall want it good by mister aladdin i surely will cried rebecca tossing back her dark braids delightedly and waving her hand oh rebecca said emma jane in an awe struck whisper
he raised his hat to us and we not thirteen itll be five years before were ladies never mind answered rebecca we are the beginnings of ladies even now he tucked the lap robe round us too continued emma jane
in an ecstasy of reminiscence oh isnt he perfectly elergant and wasnt it lovely of him to buy us out and just think of having both the lamp and the shade for one days work arent you glad you wore your pink gingham now
even if mother did make you put on flannel underneath you do look so pretty in pink and red rebecca and so homely in drab and brown i know it sighed rebecca i wish i was like you pretty in all colors
and rebecca looked longingly at emma janes fat rosy cheeks at her blue eyes which said nothing at her neat nose which had no character at her red lips from between which no word worth listening to had ever issued
never mind said emma jane comfortingly everybody says youre awful bright and smart and mother thinks youll be better looking all the time as you grow older you wouldnt believe it but i was a dreadful homely baby
aunt miranda would say that was just like me and it is but i called him mister aladdin because he gave us a lamp you know the story of aladdin and the wonderful lamp
oh rebecca how could you call him a nickname the very first time you ever saw him aladdin isnt a nickname exactly anyway he laughed and seemed to like it
by dint of superhuman effort and putting such a seal upon their lips as never mortals put before the two girls succeeded in keeping their wonderful news to themselves
on thanksgiving the lamp arrived in a large packing box and was taken out and set up by seesaw simpson who suddenly began to admire and respect the business ability of his sisters
the stirring of the powers rebeccas visit to milltown was all that her glowing fancy had painted it except that recent readings about rome and venice disposed her to believe that those cities might have an advantage over milltown
in the matter of mere pictorial beauty so soon does the soul outgrow its mansions that after once seeing milltown her fancy ran out to the future sight of portland for that having islands and a harbor and two public monuments
must be far more beautiful than milltown which would she felt take its proud place among the cities of the earth by reason of its tremendous business activity rather than by any irresistible appeal to the imagination
i tell you harriet beecher stowe herself couldnt a done it better justice i took it all in responded mister cobb who was pleased that mother agreed with him about rebecca i aint sure but shes goin to turn out somethin remarkable
land no mother there aint no homepath bout miss parks she drives all over the country i cant see rebecca as a lady doctor somehow mused missus cobb her gift o gab is whats goin to be the makin of her
or recite pieces like that portland elocutionist that come out here to the harvest supper i guess shell be able to write down her own pieces said mister cobb confidently she could make em up faster n she could read em out of a book
rebecca made a poor hand at composition writing at this time miss dearborn gave her every sort of subject that she had ever been given herself cloud pictures abraham lincoln nature philanthropy slavery intemperance joy and duty
solitude but with none of them did rebecca seem to grapple satisfactorily write as you talk rebecca insisted poor miss dearborn who secretly knew that she could never manage a good composition herself
now in your last one on solitude you havent said anything very interesting and youve made it too common and every day to sound well there are too many yous and yours in it you ought to say one now and then to make it seem more like good writing one opens a favorite book
ones thoughts are a great comfort in solitude and so on i dont know any more about solitude this week than i did about joy and duty last week grumbled rebecca you tried to be funny about joy and duty said miss dearborn reprovingly so of course you didnt succeed
of recollection joy and duty had been the inspiring subject given to the older children for a theme to be written in five minutes rebecca had wrestled struggled perspired in vain when her turn came to read
she was obliged to confess she had written nothing you have at least two lines rebecca insisted the teacher for i see them on your slate
read what you have good or bad little or much i am excusing nobody rebecca rose overcome with secret laughter dread and mortification then in a low voice she read the couplet
and the training of the young idea seldom appealed to the sense of humor you must stay after school and try again rebecca she said but she said it smilingly your poetry hasnt a very nice idea in it for a good little girl who ought to love duty
it wasnt my idea said rebecca apologetically i had only made the first line when i saw you were going to ring the bell and say the time was up i had clash written and i couldnt think of anything then but hash or rash or smash ill change it to this
having been instructed in the use of the indefinite pronoun one as giving a refined and elegant touch to literary efforts rebecca painstakingly rewrote her composition on solitude giving it all the benefit of miss dearborns suggestion
it then appeared in the following form which hardly satisfied either teacher or pupil solitude it would be false to say that one could ever be alone when one has ones lovely thoughts to comfort one
one sits by ones self it is true but one thinks one opens ones favorite book and reads ones favorite story one speaks to ones aunt or ones brother fondles ones cat
does one ever feel bereft when one picks up ones chips to light ones fire for ones evening meal or when one washes ones milk pail before milking ones cow one would fancy not r r r
dont you think calling supper ones evening meal is pretty and isnt bereft a nice word yes that part of it does very well it is the cat the chips and the milk pail that i dont like
yes i dont like a cow in a composition said the difficult miss dearborn
for the next week minnie smellies mother told miranda sawyer that shed better look after rebecca for she was given to swearing and profane language that she had been heard saying something dreadful that very afternoon saying it before emma jane and living perkins who only laughed
dont be ugly and obstinate but think real hard when did they chase you up the road and what were you doing a sudden light broke upon rebeccas darkness
emma jane living and i were walking along and i was ahead i saw the water streaming over the road towards the ditch and it reminded me of uncle toms cabin at milltown when eliza took her baby and ran across the mississippi on the ice blocks pursued by the bloodhounds
we couldnt keep from laughing after we came out of the tent because they were acting on such a small platform that eliza had to run round and round
and part of the time she had to pursue the dog i knew living would remember too so i took off my waterproof and wrapped it round my books for a baby
just like that the same as eliza did in the play then i leaped from puddle to puddle and living and emma jane pursued me like the bloodhounds its just like that stupid minnie smellie who doesnt know a game when she sees one and eliza wasnt swearing when she said my god the river
it was more like praying well youve got no call to be prayin any more than swearin in the middle of the road said miranda but im thankful its no worse youre born to trouble as the sparks fly upward
an im afraid you allers will be till you learn to bridle your unruly tongue i wish sometimes that i could bridle minnies murmured rebecca as she went to set the table for supper i declare she is the beatinest child said miranda
but whether its for the better or the worse i cant hardly tell till she grows up shes got the making of most anything in her rebecca has but i feel sometimes as if we were not fitted to cope with her stuff an nonsense said miranda
the banquet lamp there had been company at the brick house to the bountiful thanksgiving dinner which had been provided at one oclock the burnham sisters who lived between north riverboro and shaker village and who for more than a quarter of a century
had come to pass the holiday with the sawyers every year rebecca sat silent with a book after the dinner dishes were washed and when it was nearly five asked if she might go to the simpsons
cant you set still for once and listen to the improvin conversation of your elders
what under the canopy did they want of a lamp and where did they get the money to pay for it if abner was at home i should think hed been swappin again said miss miranda the children got it as a prize for selling soap replied rebecca
what have you got in the pocket of that new dress that makes it sag down so its my nuts and raisins from dinner replied rebecca who never succeeded in keeping the most innocent action a secret from her aunt miranda theyre just what you gave me on my plate why didnt you eat them
they were your own rebecca interposed aunt jane and if you chose to save them to give away it is all right we ought never to let this day pass without giving our neighbors something to be thankful for instead of taking all the time to think of our own mercies
the burnham sisters nodded approvingly as rebecca went out and remarked that they had never seen a child grow and improve so fast in so short a time theres plenty of room left for more improvement as youd know if she lived in the same house with you answered miranda
one of them must have said miss ellen burnham
it must have been clara belle and i should never call her remarkable answered miss miranda has adam been home again yes hes been staying a few days with his aunt theres no limit to the money hes making they say and he always brings presents for all the neighbors
this time it was a full set of furs for missus ladd and to think we can remember the time he was a barefoot boy without two shirts to his back it is strange he hasnt married with all his money and him so fond of children that he always has a pack of them at his heels
theres hope for him still though said miss jane smilingly for i dont spose hes more than thirty he could get a wife in riverboro if he was a hundred and thirty remarked miss miranda adams aunt says he was so taken with the little girl that sold the soap clara belle did you say her name was
that he declared he was going to bring her a christmas present continued miss ellen well theres no accountin for tastes exclaimed miss miranda clara belles got cross eyes and red hair but id be the last one to grudge her a christmas present
for this one couldnt have been cross eyed i remember missus ladd saying adam remarked about this childs handsome eyes he said it was her eyes that made him buy the three hundred cakes missus ladd has it stacked up in the shed chamber
three hundred cakes ejaculated miranda well theres one crop that never fails in riverboro whats that asked miss lydia politely the fool crop responded miranda tersely
and changed the subject much to janes gratitude for she had been nervous and ill at ease for the last fifteen minutes what child in riverboro could be described as remarkable and winning save rebecca what child had wonderful eyes except the same rebecca
and finally was there ever a child in the world who could make a man buy soap by the hundred cakes save rebecca meantime the remarkable child had flown up the road in the deepening dusk but she had not gone far before she heard the sound of hurrying footsteps
and saw a well known figure coming in her direction in a moment she and emma jane met and exchanged a breathless embrace something awful has happened panted emma jane dont tell me its broken exclaimed rebecca no oh no not that
our selling the three hundred cakes corrected rebecca you did as much as i no i didnt rebecca randall i just sat at the gate and held the horse yes but whose horse was it that took us to north riverboro
but whats the trouble the simpsons have no kerosene and no wicks i guess they thought a banquet lamp was something that lighted itself and burned without any help seesaw has gone to the doctors to try if he can borrow a wick and mother let me have a pint of oil but she says she wont give me any more
we never thought of the expense of keeping up the lamp rebecca no we didnt but lets not worry about that till after the party i have a handful of nuts and raisins and some apples i have peppermints and maple sugar said emma jane they had a real thanksgiving dinner
the doctor gave them sweet potatoes and cranberries and turnips father sent a spare rib and missus cobb a chicken and a jar of mince meat at half past five one might have looked in at the simpsons windows and seen the party at its height
missus simpson had let the kitchen fire die out and had brought the baby to grace the festal scene
on it stood the sacred the adored the long desired object almost as beautiful and nearly half as large as the advertisement the brass glistened like gold and the crimson paper shade glowed like a giant ruby
in the wide splash of light that it flung upon the floor sat the simpsons in reverent and solemn silence emma jane standing behind them hand in hand with rebecca there seemed to be no desire for conversation the occasion was too thrilling and serious for that
the lamp it was tacitly felt by everybody was dignifying the party and providing sufficient entertainment simply by its presence being fully as satisfactory in its way as a pianola or a string band i wish father could see it said clara belle loyally
murmured susan sagaciously at the appointed hour rebecca dragged herself reluctantly away from the enchanting scene
and oh im so glad you both live where you can see it shine from our windows i wonder how long it will burn without bein filled if i only keep it lit one hour every night
mister tubbs brought it over from north riverboro and said somebody sent an order by mail for it rebecca squeezed emma janes arm and emma jane gave a rapturous return squeeze
it was mister aladdin whispered rebecca as they ran down the path to the gate seesaw followed them and handsomely offered to see them apiece down the road but rebecca declined his escort with such decision that he did not press the matter
but went to bed to dream of her instead in his dreams flashes of lightning proceeded from both her eyes and she held a flaming sword in either hand rebecca entered the home dining room joyously the burnham sisters had gone and the two aunts were knitting
it was a heavenly party she cried taking off her hat and cape go back and see if you have shut the door tight and then lock it said miss miranda in her usual austere manner
and oh aunt jane aunt miranda if youll only come into the kitchen and look out of the sink window you can see the banquet lamp shining all red just as if the simpsons house was on fire and probably it will be before long observed miranda ive got no patience with such foolish goins on
jane accompanied rebecca into the kitchen although the feeble glimmer which she was able to see from that distance did not seem to her a dazzling exhibition she tried to be as enthusiastic as possible rebecca who was it
that sold the three hundred cakes of soap to mister ladd in north riverboro mister who exclaimed rebecca mister ladd in north riverboro is that his real name queried rebecca in astonishment i didnt make a bad guess and she laughed softly to herself
i asked you who sold the soap to adam ladd resumed miss jane adam ladd then hes a ladd too what fun answer me rebecca oh excuse me aunt jane i was so busy thinking emma jane and i sold the soap to mister ladd
he needed the soap dreadfully as a present for his aunt miss jane still looked a little unconvinced though she only said i hope your aunt miranda wont mind but you know how particular she is rebecca and i really wish you wouldnt do anything out of the ordinary without asking her first for your actions are very queer
there cant be anything wrong this time rebecca answered confidently emma jane sold her cakes to her own relations and to uncle jerry cobb and i went first to those new tenements near the lumber mill and then to the ladds mister ladd bought all we had and made us promise to keep the secret until the premium came
rebeccas hair was loosened and falling over her forehead in ruffled waves her eyes were brilliant her cheeks crimson there was a hint of everything in the girls face of sensitiveness and delicacy as well as of ardor
there was the sweetness of the mayflower and the strength of the young oak but one could easily divine that she was one of the souls by nature pitched too high by suffering plunged too low
the third man from the end oh patty did you bring us some wedding cake did you have any adventures
with the dexterity of practice sprang upon the rear step of the hearse as it turned in at the school gate and rolled up the curving drive to the porte cochere the hearse was the popular name for the black varnished wagonette which conveyed the pupils of saint ursulas from church and station
it was planned to accommodate twenty patty and her suit case alone in the capacious interior were jolting about like two tiny peas in a very big pod
as they came to a stop they were besieged by a crowd of blue coated girls it was afternoon recreation and the whole school was abroad the welcome that she received would have led an onlooker to infer that patty had been gone three months instead of three days she and her two
postilions descended and martin gathered up his reins come on youse all who wants a ride to the stables was his hospitable invitation it inundated him with passengers they crowded inside twice as many as the hearse would hold
they swarmed over the drivers seat and the steps and two equestriennes even perched themselves on the horses backs whats the adventure demanded conny and priscilla in a breath as the cavalcade rattled off patty waved her hand toward the suit case
there it is take it upstairs ill be with you as soon as ive reported but that isnt your suit case patty shook her head mysteriously if you tried a thousand years youd never guess who owns it who patty laughed
just a little souvenir that i picked up ill tell you as soon as ive interviewed the dowager hurry and slip in while jelly isnt looking they cast a quick glance over their shoulders toward the gymnasium instructor who was arguing fat irene mc cullough into faster movements on the tennis court
miss jellings was insistent that recreation should be actively pursued out of doors the two could easily have obtained permission to greet pattys return inside but it was the policy of the trio never to ask permission in minor matters it wasted ones credit unnecessarily
priscilla and conny turned upstairs lugging the suit case between them while patty approached the principals study ten minutes later she joined her companions in seven paradise alley they were sitting on the bed their chins in their hands
studying the suit case propped on a chair before them well they inquired in a breath she says shes glad to see me back and hopes i didnt eat too much wedding cake
the man with the black eyebrows and the dimple in his chin who sang the funny songs third from the end on the right hand side jermyn hilliard junior priscilla asked breathlessly not really conny laid her hand on her heart with an exaggerated sigh
truly and honest patty turned it over and pointed to the initials on the end
is it locked yes patty nodded but my key will open it
and things whered you get it well said patty languidly its a long story
i think youre beastly well the glee club was last thursday night
when we got in it was cram full of men the entire yale glee club was going to the station there were so many of them that they were sitting in each others laps the whole top layer rose and said perfectly gravely and politely madame take my seat
mamselle was outraged she said in french which of course they all understood that she thought american college boys had disgraceful manners but i smiled a little i couldnt help it they were so funny and then two of the bottom ones offered their seats and we sat down
and youll never believe it but the third man from the end was sitting right next to me not really oh patty is he as good looking near to as he was on the stage better are those his real eyebrows or were they blacked
she was as flustered as an old hen with one chicken she put me in charge of the conductor with so many instructions that i know he felt like a newly engaged nursemaid the glee club men rode in the smoking car
except jermyn hilliard junior and he followed me right into the parlor car and sat down in the chair exactly opposite patty they cried in shocked chorus you surely didnt speak to him
oh conny murmured disappointedly then what happened priscilla asked nothing at all i got out at coomsdale and uncle tom met me with the automobile the chauffeur took my suit case from the porter and i didnt see it near to at all we reached the house just at tea time
and i went straight in to tea without going upstairs the butler took up my suit case and the maid came and asked for the key so she could unpack that house is simply running over with servants im always scared to death
all the ushers and bridesmaids were there and everything was very jolly only i couldnt make out what they were talking about half the time because they all knew each other and had a lot of jokes i couldnt understand
conny nodded feelingly thats the way they acted at the seaside last summer i think grown people have horrid manners i did feel sort of young patty acknowledged
he was trying to obey louise and amuse little cousin but he was thinking all the time
i told you to put it up said priscilla just wait said patty portentously when i went upstairs to dress for dinner the maid met me in the hall with her eyes popping out of her head beg pardon miss patty she said but is that your suit case yes i said of course its my suit case
whats the matter with it she just waved her hand toward the table and didnt say a word and there it was wide open patty took a key from her pocket unlocked the suit case and threw back the lid a mans dress suit was neatly folded on the top with a pipe a box of cigarettes some collars
and various other masculine trifles filling in the interstices oh they gasped in breathless chorus they belong to him conny murmured fervently patty nodded and when i showed uncle tom that suit case he nearly died laughing
he telephoned to the station but they didnt know anything about it
uncle tom lives five miles from town and there simply wasnt anything we could do that night and just imagine his feelings when he started to dress for the concert and found pattys new pink evening gown spread out on top suggested priscilla oh patty
just like all my dancing dresses nine inches off the floor with elbow sleeves and a silly sash i hated it anyway you must remember you are a school girl conny quoted and until just wait till i tell you patty triumphed
the man who took me in to dinner never dreamed that i hadnt been out for years and you know he tried to flirt with me he did really and he was getting awfully old he must have been almost forty i felt as though i were flirting with my grandfather you know patty added it isnt so bad being grown up
before patty resumed her chronicle and uncle tom made me tell about the suit case at the dinner table everybody laughed it made a very exciting story i told them about the whole school going to the glee club and falling in love in a body with the third man from the end
and how we all cut his picture out of the program and pasted it in our watches and then about my sitting across from him in the train and changing suit cases mister harper the man next to me said it was the most romantic thing hed ever heard in his life that louises marriage was nothing to it
but you didnt leave it i came on the other road im going to send it down and what did you wear at the wedding louises clothes it didnt matter a bit my not matching the other bridesmaids because i was maid of honor and ought to dress differently anyway ive been grown up for three days
talking to men did you tell the dowager yes i told her about getting the wrong suit case i didnt mention the fact that it belonged to the third man from the end what did she say she said it was very careless of me to run off with a strange mans luggage
and she hoped he was a gentleman and would take it nicely she telephoned to the baggage man that it was here but she couldnt send martin with it this afternoon because he had to go to the farm for some eggs recreation was over and the girls came trooping in to gather books and pads and pencils for the approaching study hour
everyone who passed number seven dropped in to hear the news each in turn received the story of the suit case and each in turn
doesnt it smell tobaccoey and bay rummish said rosalie patton sniffing oh theres a button loose cried florence hissop the careful housewife wheres some black silk patty she threaded a needle and secured the button then she daringly tried on the coat
eight others followed her example and thrilled at the touch it was calculated to fit a far larger person than any present even irene mc cullough found it baggy he had awfully broad shoulders said rosalie stroking the satin lining
they peered daintily at the other garments oh squealed mae mertelle he wears blue silk suspenders and something else blue chirped edna hartwell peering over her shoulder theyre pajamas and to think of such a thing happening to patty
sighed mae mertelle why not bristled patty youre so
young wait till you see me with my hair done up
the end said mae unkindly will be that the baggage man will deliver the suit case and jermyn hilliard junior will never know a maid appeared at the door if you please she murmured her amazed eyes on irene who was still wearing the coat
missus trent would like to have miss patty wyatt come to the drawing room and i am to take the suit case down the gentleman is waiting oh patty a gasp went around the room do your hair up quick priscilla caught pattys twin braids and wound them around her head
while the others in a flutter of excitement thrust in the coat and relocked the suit case they crowded after her in a body and hung over the banisters at a perilous angle straining their ears in the direction of the drawing room nothing but a murmur of voices floated up
punctuated by an occasional deep bass laugh when they heard the front door close with one accord they invaded harriet gladdens room which commanded the walk and pressed their noses against the pane a short thick set man of german build was waddling toward the gate and the trolley car
they gazed with wide horrified eyes and turned without a word to meet patty as she trudged upstairs lugging her errant suit case a glance told her that they had seen and dropping on the top step she leaned her head against the railing and laughed
in this miserable state they came to the first village the peasants wives flocked about them and as it appeared through their disguise that they were people of some condition asked them what was the occasion of their travelling in a habit that did not seem to belong to them
instead of answering the question they fell to weeping which only served to heighten the curiosity of the peasants and to move their compassion ganems mother told them what she and her daughter had endured at which the good countrywomen were sensibly afflicted
and endeavoured to comfort them they treated them as well as their poverty would permit took off their horse hair shifts which were very uneasy to them and put on them others which they gave them with shoes and something to cover their heads and save their hair
jalib al koolloob and her mother departed from that village taking short journeys towards aleppo they used at dusk to retire near or into the mosques where they passed the night on the mat if there was any
or else on the bare pavement and sometimes rested in the public places appointed for the use of travellers as for sustenance they did not want for they often came to places where bread boiled rice and other provisions are distributed to all travellers who desire it
at length they came to aleppo but would not stay there and continuing their journey towards the euphrates crossed the river
thence notwithstanding all they had endured they proceeded to bagdad that was the place they had fixed their thoughts upon
but they hoped because they wished it their affection for him increasing instead of diminishing with their misfortunes their conversation was generally about him and they inquired for him of all they met but let us leave jalib al koolloob and her mother
and return to fetnah she was still confined closely in the dark tower since the day that had been so fatal to ganem and herself however disagreeable as her prison was to her it was much less grievous than the thoughts of ganems misfortune
the uncertainty of whose fate was a killing affliction there was scarcely a moment in which she did not lament him
and sometimes by those night walks came to the knowledge of things that happened in his court which would otherwise never have reached his ear one of those nights in his walk he happened to pass by the dark tower and fancying he heard somebody talk
stops and drawing near the door to listen distinctly heard these words which fetnah whose thoughts were always on ganem uttered with a loud voice o ganem too unfortunate ganem where are you at this time
whither has thy cruel fate led thee alas it is i that have made you wretched why did you not let me perish miserably rather than afford me your generous relief what melancholy return have you received for your care and respect
the commander of the faithful who ought to have rewarded persecutes you and in requital for having always regarded me as a person reserved for his bed you lose your fortune and are obliged to seek for safety in flight
how can you exculpate yourself when you shall appear with ganem before the tribunal of the supreme judge and the angels shall testify the truth before your face all the power you are now invested with and which makes almost the whole world tremble
will not prevent your being condemned and punished for your violent and unjust proceedings here fetnah ceased her complaints her sighs and tears putting a stop to her utterance
he plainly perceived that if what he had heard was true his favourite must be innocent and that he had been too hasty in giving such orders against ganem and his family
he was overjoyed at the thought for he respected fetnah and had been much concerned at her disgrace therefore flying instantly to the tower madam said he to the favourite with such an air as expressed his satisfaction be pleased to follow me
i hope you will never more return to this melancholy abode the commander of the faithful wishes to speak with you and i draw from this a happy omen
she prostrated herself before him and so continued her face bathed in tears
i think you charge me with violence and injustice who is he that notwithstanding the regard and respell he had for me is in a miserable condition speak freely
you know the natural goodness of my disposition and that i love to do justice by these words
commander of the true believers said she if i have let fall any word that is not agreeable to your majesty i most humbly beseech you to forgive me but he whose innocence and wretched state you desire to be informed of
is ganem the unhappy son of abou ayoub late a rich merchant of damascus he saved my life from a grave and afforded me a sanctuary in his house
i must own that from the first moment he saw me he perhaps designed to devote himself to me and conceived hopes of engaging me to admit his love i guessed at this by the eagerness which he shewed in entertaining me
and doing me all the good offices i so much wanted under the circumstances i was then in but as soon as he heard that i had the honour to belong to you ah madam said he that which belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave from that moment
i owe this justice to his virtue to declare his behaviour was always suitable to his words you commander of the true believers well know with what rigour you have treated him and you will answer for it before the tribunal of god
i must make a confession which perhaps may displease you but i beg pardon of your majesty beforehand speak daughter said haroon al rusheed i forgive you all provided you conceal nothing from me well then replied fetnah
let me inform you that ganems respectful behaviour joined to all the good offices he did me gained him my esteem i went further yet you know the tyranny of love i felt some tender inclination rising in my breast
he perceived it but far from availing himself of my frailty and notwithstanding the flame which consumed him he still remained steady in his duty and all that his passion could force from him were the words i have already repeated to your majesty
that which belongs to the master is forbidden to the slave this ingenuous confession
and enlarging on the obligations she owed to ganem but above all she highly extolled his discretion
when she had done speaking
i believe all you have told me but why was it so long before you let me hear from you was there any need of staying a whole month after my return before you sent me word where you were commander of the true believers answered fetnah
ganem went abroad so very seldom that you need not wonder we were not the first that heard of your return besides ganem who took upon him to deliver the letter i wrote to nouron nihar
was a long time before he could find an opportunity of putting it into her own hands it is enough fetnah
i acknowledge my fault and would willingly make amends for it by heaping favours on the young merchant of damascus consider therefore what i can do for him ask what you think fit and i will grant it
and rising again said commander of the true believers after returning your majesty thanks for ganem i most humbly entreat you to cause it to be published throughout your do minions that you pardon the son of abou ayoub and that he may safely come to you
i must do more rejoined the prince in requital for having saved your life and the respect he has strewn for me to make amends for the loss of his fortune in short to repair the wrong i have done to himself and his family
i give him to you for a husband
she then withdrew into the apartment she had occupied before her melancholy adventure
she spend the whole day and the thousand pieces of gold in giving alms at the mosques and returned to the palace in the evening
the next day she took another purse of the same value and in the like equipage as the day before went to the square of the jewellers shops and stopping at the gateway without alighting sent one of her black eunuchs for the syndic or chief of them
the syndic who was a most charitable man and spent above two thirds of his income in relieving poor strangers sick or in distress did not make fetnah wait knowing by her dress that she was a lady belonging to the palace i apply myself to you said she
putting the purse into his hands as a person whose piety is celebrated throughout the city i desire you to distribute that gold among the poor strangers you relieve for i know you make it your business to assist those who apply to your charity
i am also satisfied that you prevent their wants and that nothing is more grateful to you than to have an opportunity of relieving their misery madam answered the syndic i shall obey your commands with pleasure but if you desire to exercise your charity in person
and will be pleased to step to my house
i met them yesterday as they were coming into the city they were in a deplorable condition and it moved me the more because i thought they were persons of rank through all the rags that covered them notwithstanding the impression the sun has made on their faces
whilst she herself led them to our warm bath and gave them clean linen
because we wish to let them take some rest before we trouble them with our questions fetnah without knowing why felt a curiosity to see them the syndic would have conducted her to his house
for they were the persons the syndic had been speaking of to fetnah the syndics wife being informed by the slave that a lady from the palace was in her house was hastening to meet her but fetnah who had followed the slave did not give her time
on her coming into the chamber the syndics wife prostrated herself before her
fetnah raised her up and said my good lady
madam answered the syndics wife they lie in those beds you see by each other
good woman said she i come to offer you my assistance i have considerable interest in this city and may be of service to you and your companion madam answered ganems mother
that fetnah and the syndics wife could not forbear letting fall some tears
said to ganems mother be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes and recount your story you cannot make the relation to any persons better disposed to use all possible means to comfort you
madam replied abou ayoubs disconsolate widow a favourite of the commander of the true believers a lady whose name is fetnah is the occasion of all our misfortunes these words were like a thunderbolt to the favourite
but suppressing her agitation and concern she suffered ganems mother to proceed in the following manner
i had a son called ganem who coming to trade at bagdad has been accused of carrying off fetnah
and then to banish us out of syria for ever but how unworthy soever our usage has been
what a pleasure would it be for his sister and me to see him again embracing him we should forget the loss of our property and all the evils we have suffered on his account alas
no doubt of it said fetnah interrupting her there he is no more guilty than you are i can assure you of his innocence for i am that very fetnah you so much complain of who through some fatality in my stars
have occasioned you so many misfortunes to me you must impute the loss of your son if he is no more but if i have occasioned your misfortune i can in some measure relieve it
and doubt not he will do you as much good as he has done you injury you are no longer his enemies he waits for ganem to requite the service he has done me by uniting our fortunes he gives me to him for his consort
therefore look on me as your daughter and permit me to vow eternal duty and affection having so said she bowed down on ganems mother who was so astonished that she could return no answer
fetnah held her long in her arms and only left her to embrace the daughter who sitting up
the wealth ganem had in this city is not lost it is in my apartment in the palace but i know all the treasure of the world cannot comfort you without ganem if i may judge of you by myself blood is no less powerful than love in great minds
but why should we despair of seeing him again we shall find him the happiness of meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes perhaps this is the last day of your sufferings and the beginning of a greater felicity than you enjoyed in damascus
when ganem was with you fetnah would have proceeded but the syndic of the jewellers coming in interrupted her madam said he to her i come from seeing a very moving object it is a young man whom a camel driver had just carried to an hospital
he was bound with cords on a camel because he had not strength enough to sit they had already unbound him and were carrying him into the hospital when i happened to pass by i went up to the young man viewed him attentively
and fancied his countenance was not altogether unknown to me i asked him some questions concerning his family and his country but all the answers i could get were sighs and tears i took pity on him
perceived that he had need to have particular care taken of him i would not permit him to be put into the hospital for i am too well acquainted with their way of managing the sick and am sensible of the incapacity of the physicians
i have caused him to be brought to my own house by my slaves and they are now in a private room where i placed him putting on some of my own linen and treating him as they would do myself fetnahs heart beat at these words of the jeweller
and she felt a sudden emotion for which she could not account shew me said she to the syndic into the sick mans room i should be glad to see him the syndic conducted her and whilst she was going thither
whose eyes were closed his countenance pale disfigured and bathed in tears she gazed earnestly on him her heart beat and she fancied she beheld ganem but yet she would not believe her eyes
though she found something of ganem in the objets she beheld yet in other respects he appeared so different that she durst not imagine it was he that lay before her unable however to withstand the earnest desire of being satisfied
ganem said she with a trembling voice is it you i behold having spoken these words she stopped to give the young man time to answer but observing that he seemed insensible alas ganem added she
it is not you that i address my imagination being overcharged with your image has given to a stranger a deceitful resemblance
however indisposed would know the voice of fetnah at the name of fetnah ganem for it was really he
ah madam said he by what miracle he could say no more such a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fainted away fetnah and the syndic did all they could to bring him to himself
but as soon as they perceived he began to revive the syndic desired the lady to withdraw lest the sight of her should heighten his disorder the young man having recovered looked all around and not seeing what he sought exclaimed
what is become of you charming fetnah did you really appear before my eyes or was it only an illusion no sir said the syndic it was no illusion it was i that caused the lady to withdraw
but you shall see her again as soon as you are in a condition to bear the interview you now stand in need of rest and nothing ought to obstruct your taking it the situation of your affairs is altered since you are as i suppose that ganem
in favour of whom the commander of the true believers has caused a proclamation to be made in bagdad declaring that he forgives him what is passed be satisfied for the present with knowing so much
the lady who just now spoke to you will acquaint you with the rest therefore think of nothing but recovering your health i will contribute all in my power towards it having spoke these words he left ganem to take his rest
exhausted by hard living and toil
there was no occasion for the syndics saying any more to ganems mother as soon as she was told that she could not converse with her son without hazarding his life she ceased insisting to go and see him
fetnah then said let us bless heaven for having brought us all together
and tomorrow morning i will return to you this said she embraced the mother and the daughter and went away as soon as she came to the palace
which was immediately granted and being brought into the princes closet where he was alone she prostrated herself at his feet with her face on the ground according to custom he commanded her to rise and having made her sit down asked whether she had heard any news of ganem
commander of the true believers said she i have been so successful that i have found him and also his mother and sister
and she satisfied his inquiries saying so many things in commendation of ganems mother and sister he desired to see them as well as the young merchant though haroon al rusheed was passionate and in his heat sometimes guilty of cruel actions
having therefore no longer cause to doubt but that he had unjustly persecuted ganem and his family and had publicly wronged them he resolved to make them public satisfaction
that your search has proved so successful it is a real satisfaction to me not so much for your sake as for my own i will keep the promise i have made you you shall marry ganem and i here declare you are no longer my slave you are free
go back to that young merchant and as soon as he has recovered his health you shall bring him to me with his mother and sister the next morning early fetnah repaired to the syndic of the jewellers being impatient to hear of ganems health and tell the mother and daughter the good news she had for them
who told her that ganem had rested well that night and that his disorder proceeding altogether from melancholy the cause being removed he would soon recover his health
rest and the good medicines he had taken but above all the different situation of his mind had wrought so good an effect that the syndic thought he might without danger see his mother his sister and his mistress provided he was prepared to receive them
because there was ground to fear that not knowing his mother and sister were at bagdad the sight of them might occasion too great surprise and joy it was therefore resolved that fetnah should first go alone into ganems chamber
when she thought it was proper matters being so ordered the syndic announced fetnahs coming to the sick man who was so transported to see her that he was again near fainting away well ganem said she drawing near to his bed
you have again found your fetnah whom you thought you had lost for ever
what miracle has restored you to my sight
he has doubtless listened to you you have dispelled his jealousy and he has restored you to his favour yes my dear ganem answered fetnah i have cleared myself before the commander of the true believers who to make amends for the wrong he has done you
beautiful fetnah may i give credit to what you tell me
nothing is more certain answered the lady
who before caused search to be made for you to take away your life and who in his fury caused your mother and your sister to suffer a thousand indignities desires now to see you that he may reward the respect you had for him
and there is no question but that he will load your family with favours
and he could not forbear letting fall some tears at the relation notwithstanding the thoughts which arose in his mind at the prospect of being married to his mistress but when fetnah informed him that they were actually in bagdad and in the same house with him
he appeared so impatient to see them that the favourite could no longer defer giving him the satisfaction and accordingly called them in they were at the door waiting for that moment they entered went up to ganem and embracing him in their turns
the syndic himself and his wife were so moved at the spectacle that they could not forbear weeping nor sufficiently admire the secret workings of providence which had brought together into their house four persons whom fortune had so cruelly persecuted
when they had dried up their tears ganem drew them afresh by the recital of what he had suffered from the day he left fetnah till the moment the syndic brought him to his house he told them that having taken refuge in a small village he there fell sick
that some charitable peasants had taken care of him but finding he did not recover a camel driver had undertaken to carry him to the hospital at bagdad
and how she had cleared herself in conclusion when they had related what accidents had befallen them fetnah said let us bless heaven which has brought us all together again and let us think of nothing but the happiness that awaits us
as soon as ganem has recovered his health
but i will go and make some provision for them this said she went to the palace and soon returned with a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold which she delivered to the syndic desiring him to buy apparel for the mother and daughter
the syndic who was a man of a good taste chose such as were very handsome and had them made up with all expedition they were finished in three days and ganem finding himself strong enough prepared to go abroad
while he was making ready with his mother and sister the grand vizier jaaffier came to the syndics house he had come on horseback attended by a great number of officers sir said he to ganem as soon as he entered
i am come from the commander of the true believers my master and yours the orders i have differ much from those which i do not wish to revive in your memory i am to bear you company
ganem returned no other answer to the viziers compliment than by profoundly bowing his head
which he managed very gracefully the mother and daughter were mounted on mules belonging to the palace and whilst fetnah on another mule led them by a bye way to the princes court jaaffier conducted ganem and brought him into the hall of audience
arabs persians egyptians africans and syrians of his own dominions not to mention strangers when the vizier had conducted ganem to the foot of the throne
i am glad to see you and desire to hear from your own mouth where you found my favourite and all that you have done for her ganem obeyed
after which he said to him ganem i will have you live in my court commander of the true believers answered the young merchant a slave has no will but his masters on whom his life and fortune depend
and assigned him a considerable pension he then descended from his throne and causing only ganem and the grand vizier follow him retired into his own apartment
not questioning but that fetnah was in waiting with abou ayoubs widow and daughter he caused them to be called in they prostrated themselves before him he made them rise and was so charmed by jalib al koolloobs beauty
that after viewing her very attentively he said i am so sorry for having treated your charms so unworthily that i owe them such a satisfaction as may surpass the injury i have done i take you to wife
who shall become the first cause of your good fortune as she was of your past sufferings this is not all added he turning towards ganems mother you are still young i believe you will not disdain to be allied to my grand vizier
i give you to jaaffier and you fetnah to ganem let a cauzee and witnesses be called and the three contracts be drawn up and signed immediately
but he was resolved to marry her haroon thought this such an extraordinary story that he ordered his historiographer to commit it to writing with all its circumstances
peter sees rosebreast and finds redcoat
whos that peter rabbit pricked up his long ears and stared up at the tops of the trees of the old orchard instantly jenny wren popped her head out of her doorway she cocked her head on one side to listen
then looked down at peter and her sharp little eyes snapped i dont hear any strange voice said she the way you are staring peter rabbit one would think that you had really heard something new and worth while
just then there were two or three rather sharp squeaky notes from the top of one of the trees there cried peter there didnt you hear that jenny wren
for goodness sake peter rabbit you dont mean to say you dont know whose voice that is she cried thats rosebreast he and missus rosebreast have been here for quite a little while
i didnt suppose there was any one who didnt know those sharp squeaky voices they rather get on my nerves what anybody wants to squeak like that for when they can sing as rosebreast can is more than i can understand
at that very instant mister wren began to scold as only he and jenny can peter looked up at jenny and winked slyly and what anybody wants to scold like that for when they can sing as mister wren can is too much for me
retorted peter but you havent told me who rosebreast is the grosbeak of course stupid sputtered jenny if you dont know rosebreast the grosbeak peter rabbit you certainly must have been blind and deaf ever since you were born
listen to that just listen to that song peter listened there were many songs for it was a very beautiful morning and all the singers of the old orchard were pouring out the joy that was within them
one song was a little louder and clearer than the others because it came from a tree very close at hand the very tree from which those squeaky notes had come just a few minutes before peter suspected that that must be the song jenny wren meant he looked puzzled
he was puzzled do you mean welcome robins song he asked rather sheepishly for he had a feeling that he would be the victim of jenny wrens sharp tongue no i dont mean welcome robins song snapped jenny
what good are a pair of long ears if they cant tell one song from another that song may sound something like welcome robins but if your ears were good for anything at all youd know right away that that isnt welcome robin singing
thats a better song than welcome robins welcome robins song is one of good cheer but this one is of pure happiness i wouldnt have a pair of ears like yours for anything in the world peter rabbit
peter laughed right out as he tried to picture to himself jenny wren with a pair of long ears like his what are you laughing at demanded jenny crossly dont you dare laugh at me
if there is any one thing i cant stand it is being laughed at i wasnt laughing at you replied peter very meekly i was just laughing at the thought of how funny you would look with a pair of long ears like mine
now you speak of it jenny that song is quite different from welcome robins of course it is retorted jenny that is rosebreast singing up there and there he is right in the top of that tree
isnt he handsome peter looked up to see a bird a little smaller than welcome robin his head throat and back were black his wings were black with patches of white on them
but it was his breast that made peter catch his breath with a little gasp of admiration for that breast was a beautiful rose red the rest of him underneath was white it was rosebreast the grosbeak isnt he lovely
cried peter and added in the next breath who is that with him missus grosbeak of course who else would it be sputtered jenny rather crossly for she was still a little put out because she had been laughed at
said peter she doesnt look the least bit like him this was quite true there was no beautiful rose color about missus grosbeak she was dressed chiefly in brown and grayish colors with a little buff here and there and with dark streaks on her breast
over each eye was a whitish line altogether she looked more as if she might be a big member of the sparrow family than the wife of handsome rosebreast
while rosebreast sang missus grosbeak was very busily picking buds and blossoms from the tree what is she doing that for inquired peter for the same reason that you bite off sweet clover blossoms and leaves
replied jenny wren tartly do you mean to say that they live on buds and blossoms cried peter i never heard of such a thing tut tut tut tut tut you can ask more silly questions than anybody of my acquaintance retorted jenny wren
of course they dont live on buds and blossoms if they did they would soon starve to death for buds and blossoms dont last long they eat a few just for variety but they live mostly on bugs and insects
you ask farmer browns boy who helps him most in his potato patch and hell tell you its the grosbeaks they certainly do love potato bugs they eat some fruit but on the whole they are about as useful around a garden as any one i know
now run along peter rabbit and dont bother me any more seeing farmer browns boy coming through the old orchard peter decided that it was high time for him to depart so he scampered for the green forest lipperty lipperty lip
just within the edge of the green forest he caught sight of something which for the time being put all thought of farmer browns boy out of his head fluttering on the ground was a bird than whom not even glory the cardinal was more beautiful
it was about the size of redwing the blackbird wings and tail were pure black and all the rest was a beautiful scarlet it was redcoat the tanager at first peter had eyes only for the wonderful beauty of redcoat
never before had he seen redcoat so close at hand then quite suddenly it came over peter that something was wrong with redcoat and he hurried forward to see what the trouble might be redcoat heard the rustle of peters feet among the dry leaves
but he could not get off the ground what is it redcoat has something happened to you it is just peter rabbit you dont have anything to fear from me cried peter the look of terror which had been in the eyes of redcoat died out
and he stopped fluttering and simply lay panting oh peter he gasped you dont know how glad i am that it is only you ive had a terrible accident and i dont know what i am to do
i cant fly and if i have to stay on the ground some enemy will be sure to get me what shall i do peter what shall i do right away peter was full of sympathy
what kind of an accident was it redcoat and how did it happen he asked broadwing the hawk tried to catch me
and did not see just where i was going i struck a sharp pointed dead twig and drove it right through my right wing redcoat held up his right wing and sure enough there was a little stick projecting from both sides close up to the shoulder
the wing was bleeding a little oh dear whatever shall i do peter rabbit
sobbed redcoat does it pain you dreadfully asked peter redcoat nodded but i dont mind the pain he hastened to say it is the thought of what may happen to me
poor redcoat with the old look of terror in his eyes fluttered along trying to find something under which to hide but there was nothing under which he could crawl and there was no hiding that wonderful red coat
peter heard the sound of heavy footsteps and looking back saw that farmer browns boy was coming dont be afraid redcoat he whispered its farmer browns boy and im sure he wont hurt you perhaps he can help you
then peter scampered off for a short distance and sat up to watch what would happen
no one with any eyes at all could have helped seeing him because of that wonderful scarlet coat he saw too by the way redcoat was acting that he was in great trouble as farmer browns boy drew near and redcoat saw that he was discovered
he tried his hardest to flutter away farmer browns boy understood instantly that something was wrong with one wing and running forward he caught redcoat you poor little thing
said farmer browns boy softly as he saw the cruel twig sticking through redcoats shoulder
continued farmer browns boy stroking redcoat ever so gently somehow at that gentle touch redcoat lost much of his fear and a little hope sprang in his heart
farmer browns boy took out his knife and carefully cut off the twig on the upper side of the wing then doing his best to be careful and to hurt as little as possible he worked the other part of the twig out from the under side
carefully he examined the wing to see if any bones were broken none were and after holding redcoat a few minutes he carefully set him up in a tree and withdrew a short distance redcoat hopped from branch to branch
until he was halfway up the tree then he sat there for some time as if fearful of trying that injured wing meanwhile missus tanager came and fussed about him and talked to him and coaxed him and made as much of him as if he were a baby
from tree to tree he flew
the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple and considering it under all its aspects thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday madame thenardier was approaching her forties which is equivalent to fifty in a woman
so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this thenardier woman ever since her first appearance tall blond red fat angular square
enormous and agile she belonged as we have said to the race of those colossal wild women who contort themselves at fairs with paving stones hanging from their hair she did everything about the house
made the beds did the washing the cooking and everything else cosette was her only servant a mouse in the service of an elephant everything trembled at the sound of her voice window panes furniture and people
her big face dotted with red blotches presented the appearance of a skimmer she had a beard she was an ideal market porter dressed in womans clothes she swore splendidly
she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist except for the romances which she had read and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times in a very queer way the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her
that is a woman this thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife when one heard her speak one said that is a gendarme when one saw her drink one said that is a carter
when one saw her handle cosette one said that is the hangman one of her teeth projected when her face was in repose thenardier was a small thin pale angular bony feeble man
his cunning began here he smiled habitually by way of precaution and was almost polite to everybody even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing he had the glance of a pole cat and the bearing of a man of letters
he greatly resembled the portraits of the abbe delille his coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters no one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk he smoked a big pipe
he wore a blouse and under his blouse an old black coat he made pretensions to literature and to materialism there were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying voltaire
he declared that he had a system in addition he was a great swindler
the species does exist it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army he was in the habit of relating with exuberance how being a sergeant in the sixth or the ninth light something or other at waterloo
he had alone and in the presence of a squadron of death dealing hussars covered with his body and saved from death in the midst of the grape shot a general who had been dangerously wounded
thence arose for his wall the flaring sign and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood of the cabaret of the sergeant of waterloo he was a liberal a classic and a bonapartist
we believe that he had simply studied in holland for an inn keeper this rascal of composite order was in all probability some fleming from lille in flanders a frenchman in paris a belgian at brussels
being comfortably astride of both frontiers as for his prowess at waterloo the reader is already acquainted with that it will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle ebb and flow
a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life and apparently at the stormy epoch of june eighteenth eighteen fifteen thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken
beating about the country selling to some stealing from others and travelling like a family man with wife and children in a rickety cart in the rear of troops on the march with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army
this campaign ended and having as he said
of gold rings and silver crosses gathered in harvest time in furrows sown with corpses did not amount to a large total and did not carry this sutler turned eating house keeper very far
accompanied by an oath recalls the barracks and by a sign of the cross the seminary he was a fine talker he allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man
but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it thenardier was cunning greedy slothful and clever he did not disdain his servants which caused his wife to dispense with them
this giantess was jealous it seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object coveted by all thenardier who was above all an astute and well balanced man was a scamp of a temperate sort
this is the worst species hypocrisy enters into it it is not that thenardier was not on occasion capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife but this was very rare
and at such times since he was enraged with the human race in general as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred and since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs
who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen them and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand as a legitimate grievance the sum total of the deceptions the bankruptcies and the calamities of their lives
when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes he was terrible woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time in addition to his other qualities thenardier was attentive and penetrating
silent or talkative according to circumstances and always highly intelligent he had something of the look of sailors who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses thenardier was a statesman
every new comer who entered the tavern said on catching sight of madame thenardier there is the master of the house a mistake she was not even the mistress the husband was both master and mistress
she worked he created he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action a word was sufficient for him sometimes a sign the mastodon obeyed
though she did not thoroughly realize it she was possessed of virtues after her own kind if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with
which was an inadmissible hypothesis by the way she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever she would never have committed before strangers that
exposing the crown although their concord had only evil as its result
viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side this was that grand and universal thing the adoration of mind by matter for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty
hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman at certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle at others she felt him like a claw this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children
and who did not fear any one except her husband she was a mother because she was mammiferous but her maternity stopped short with her daughters and as we shall see did not extend to boys the man had but one thought how to enrich himself
a theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking
if ruin is possible to zero in switzerland or in the pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire but an inn keeper must browse where fate has hitched him
it will be understood that the word inn keeper is here employed in a restricted sense and does not extend to an entire class in this same year eighteen twenty three
thenardier was burdened with about fifteen hundred francs worth of petty debts and this rendered him anxious whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case thenardier was one of those men who understand best
with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples hospitality besides he was an admirable poacher
and quoted for his skill in shooting he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh which was particularly dangerous his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
he had professional aphorisms which he inserted into his wifes mind the duty of the inn keeper
and a smile to stop passers by to empty small purses and to honestly lighten heavy ones to shelter travelling families respectfully
to shave the man to pluck the woman to pick the child clean to quote the window open the window shut the chimney corner the arm chair the chair the ottoman the stool the feather bed the mattress and the truss of straw
to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror and to put a price on it and by five hundred thousand devils to make the traveller pay for everything
this man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded a hideous and terrible team while the husband pondered and combined madame thenardier thought not of absent creditors
took no heed of yesterday nor of to morrow and lived in a fit of anger all in a minute such were these two beings cosette was between them subjected to their double pressure
the man and the woman each had a different method cosette was overwhelmed with blows this was the womans she went barefooted in winter that was the mans doing
cosette ran up stairs and down washed swept rubbed dusted ran fluttered about panted moved heavy articles and weak as she was did the coarse work there was no mercy for her
a fierce mistress and venomous master the thenardier hostelry was like a spiders web in which cosette had been caught and where she lay trembling the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household
it was something like the fly serving the spiders the poor child passively held her peace what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god find themselves thus
at the very dawn of life very small
she ceased and was about to pass on in her discourse to the exposition of other matters when i break in and say excellent is thine exhortation and such as well beseemeth thy high authority
at all and if so what it is then she made answer i am anxious to fulfil my promise completely and open to thee a way of return to thy native land
what place can be left for random action when god constraineth all things to order for ex nihilo nihil is sound doctrine which none of the ancients gainsaid
although they used it of material substance not of the efficient principle this they laid down as a kind of basis for all their reasonings concerning nature now
our good aristotle says she has defined it concisely in his physics and closely in accordance with the truth how pray said i
for instance if a man is digging the earth for tillage and finds a mass of buried gold now such a find is regarded as accidental yet it is not
ex nihilo for it has its proper causes the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of which has brought the chance about for had not the cultivator been digging
had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise spot the gold would not have been found these then are the reasons why the find is a chance one in that it results from causes which met together and concurred
not from any intention on the part of the discoverer since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in the field intended that the money should be found but as i said it happened
by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the treasure we may then define chance as being an unexpected result flowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some definite end
but the meeting and concurrence of these causes arises from that inevitable chain of order which flowing from the fountain head of providence disposes all things in their due time and place
soon to draw apart and plainward each its separate way to wend when once more their waters mingle in a channel
deep and wide all the flotsam comes together that is borne upon the tide ships and trunks of trees uprooted in the torrents wild career meet as mid the swirling waters
chapter seven our virtues
our virtues it is probable that we too have still our virtues although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem
and also at a little distance from us we europeans of the day after tomorrow we firstlings of the twentieth century with all our dangerous curiosity our multifariousness and art of disguising
with our most ardent requirements well then let us look for them in our labyrinths where as we know so many things lose themselves so many things get quite lost
and is there anything finer than to search for ones own virtues is it not almost to believe in ones own virtues but this believing in ones own virtues
it will be different two hundred fifteen as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet
now with red light now with green
so we modern men owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament are determined by different moralities
and are seldom unequivocal and there are often cases also in which our actions are motley coloured
indeed at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place we learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love best all of it however unconsciously without noise
is opposed to our taste nowadays this is also an advance as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste including the enmity
and voltairean bitterness against religion and all that formerly belonged to freethinker pantomime it is the music in our conscience the dance in our spirit to which puritan litanies
moral sermons and goody goodness wont chime
let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before us
for they get the better even of their blunders
just as though in short they betray something thereby flaubert for instance
i would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure namely the unconscious astuteness with which good fat honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits
subtler even than the understanding of its victims a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered
two hundred nineteen the practice of judging and condemning morally is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so
it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature and finally it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming subtle
malice spiritualises they are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over endowed with intellectual goods and privileges are equal to them
i shall take care not to say so i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities
is precisely the spiritualising of justice
gradations of rank in the world even among things and not only among men
and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men including the cultured even the learned and perhaps philosophers also if appearances do not deceive
the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures and more refined and fastidious tastes seems absolutely uninteresting to the average man if
notwithstanding he perceive devotion to these interests he calls it desinteresse and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly there have been philosophers
who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical other worldly expression perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience instead of stating
even an action for loves sake shall be unegoistic but you fools and the praise of the self sacrificer but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows
that he wanted and obtained something for it perhaps something from himself for something from himself that he relinquished here in order to have more there perhaps in general to be more
that i honour and respect an unselfish man not however because he is unselfish but because i think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense in short the question is always
and who the other is for instance in a person created and destined for command self denial and modest retirement instead of being virtues would be the waste of virtues
so it seems to me every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one not only sins against good taste
but is also an incentive to sins of omission an additional seduction under the mask of philanthropy and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher rarer and more privileged types of men
moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations of rank their presumption must be driven home to their conscience until they thoroughly understand at last
that it is immoral to say that what is right for one is proper for another so said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme
did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not be too much in the right
fellow suffering is preached nowadays and if i gather rightly no other religion is any longer preached let the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity through all the noise which is natural to these preachers
as to all preachers he will hear a hoarse groaning genuine note of self contempt it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe which has been on the increase for a century
the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame depinay if it is not really the cause thereof the man of modern ideas
the hybrid european a tolerably ugly plebeian taken all in all absolutely requires a costume he needs history as a storeroom of costumes
to be sure he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly he changes and changes let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style
and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of nothing suiting us it is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic or classical or christian
or florentine or barocco or national in moribus et artibus it does not clothe us but the spirit especially the
historical spirit profits even by this desperation once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested put on taken off packed up and above all studied
we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style for the most spiritual festival laughter and arrogance for the transcendental height of supreme folly
and aristophanic ridicule of the world perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here the domain where even we can still be original
probably as parodists of the worlds history and as gods merry andrews perhaps though nothing else of the present have a future our laughter itself may have a future
the historical sense or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people a community or an individual has lived
the divining instinct for the relationships of these valuations for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces this historical sense
has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi barbarity into which europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and races it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty
as its sixth sense owing to this mingling the past of every form and mode of life and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another flows forth into us
by means of our semi barbarity in body and in desire we have secret access everywhere such as a noble age never had we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations
and to every form of semi barbarity that has at any time existed on earth and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi barbarity
the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything the taste and tongue for everything whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense for instance
we enjoy homer once more it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer whom men of distinguished culture
esprit vaste and even voltaire the last echo of the century cannot and could not so easily appropriate whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy the very decided yea
a dissatisfaction with its own condition or an admiration of what is strange all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property
or could not become their prey and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense with its truckling plebeian curiosity
the case is not different with shakespeare that marvelous spanish moorish saxon synthesis of taste over whom an ancient athenian
with a secret confidence and cordiality we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english populace
in which shakespeares art and taste lives as perhaps on the chiaja of naples where with all our senses awake we go our way enchanted and voluntarily
let us finally confess it that what is most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp feel taste and love what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile
is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art the essentially noble in works and men their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self sufficiency
the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste
at least to the very bad taste and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly hesitatingly and with compulsion the small short and happy godsends and glorifications of human life
as they shine here and there those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite when a super abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed
our itching is really the itching for the infinite the immeasurable like the rider on his forward panting horse we let the reins fall before the infinite we modern men we semi barbarians
whether it be hedonism pessimism utilitarianism or eudaemonism all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to pleasure and pain
that is according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations are plausible modes of thought and naivetes which every one conscious of creative powers and an artists conscience
for society with its sick and misfortuned for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us still less is it sympathy for the grumbling
who strive after power they call it freedom our sympathy is a loftier and further sighted sympathy we see how man dwarfs himself how you dwarf him
and makes his destruction desirable the discipline of suffering of great suffering know ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto
the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy its shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing enduring
creature and creator are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire folly chaos but there is also the creator
the sculptor the hardness of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day do ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creature in man
applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forged stretched roasted annealed refined
so it is sympathy against sympathy but to repeat it once more there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy
and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes two hundred twenty six
in which we have to fear and love this almost invisible inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience a world of almost in every respect captious insidious sharp
and tender yes it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity we are woven into a strong net and garment of duties and cannot disengage ourselves
precisely here we are men of duty even we occasionally it is true we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords
these are men without duty we have always fools and appearances against us
honesty granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves we free spirits well we will labour at it with all our perversity and love
and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue which alone remains may its glance some day overspread like a gilded blue mocking twilight
let us go with all our devils to the help of our god it is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account what does it matter
they will say their honesty that is their devilry and nothing else what does it matter and even if they were right have not all gods hitherto been such sanctified
our stupidity every virtue inclines to stupidity every stupidity to virtue stupid to the point of sanctity they say in russia let us be careful lest
has been more injured by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else at the same time however i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness
it is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting
but let us not be afraid things still remain today as they have always been i see no one in europe who has or discloses an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals
inevitable english utilitarians how ponderously and respectably they stalk on stalk along a homeric metaphor expresses it better in the footsteps of bentham
just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable helvetius no he was not a dangerous man helvetius c e senateur pococurante to use an expression of galiani
no new thought nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject an impossible literature
has insinuated itself also into these moralists whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one must read them concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit
is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan that is to say as a thinker who regards morality as questionable as worthy of interrogation in short as a problem
is moralizing not immoral in the end they all want english morality to be recognized as authoritative inasmuch as mankind or the general utility
or the happiness of the greatest number no the happiness of england will be best served thereby they would like by all means to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness
i mean after comfort and fashion
ponsonby sound build wigwams and settle the fuegians bifurcation of the beagle channel glaciers return to the ship second visit in the ship to the settlement equality of condition amongst the natives
having now finished with patagonia and the falkland islands i will describe our first arrival in tierra del fuego a little after noon we doubled cape saint diego and entered the famous strait of le maire
we kept close to the fuegian shore but the outline of the rugged inhospitable statenland was visible amidst the clouds in the afternoon we anchored in the bay of good success while entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this savage land
a group of fuegians partly concealed by the entangled forest were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea and as we passed by they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a loud and sonorous shout the savages followed the ship
and just before dark we saw their fire and again heard their wild cry the harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low rounded mountains of clay slate which are covered to the waters edge by one dense gloomy forest
a single glance at the landscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything i had ever beheld at night it blew a gale of wind and heavy squalls from the mountains swept past us
and we as well as others may call this good success bay in the morning the captain sent a party to communicate with the fuegians when we came within hail
and began to shout most vehemently wishing to direct us where to land when we were on shore the party looked rather alarmed but continued talking and making gestures with great rapidity it was without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle i ever beheld
i could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal
the chief spokesman was old and appeared to be the head of the family the three others were powerful young men about six feet high the women and children had been sent away these fuegians are a very different race from the stunted miserable wretches farther westward
and they seem closely allied to the famous patagonians of the strait of magellan their only garment consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin with the wool outside this they wear just thrown over their shoulders leaving their persons as often exposed as covered
his face was crossed by two broad transverse bars one painted bright red reached from ear to ear and included the upper lip the other white like chalk extended above and parallel to the first so that even his eyelids were thus coloured
the other two men were ornamented by streaks of black powder made of charcoal the party altogether closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like der freischutz their very attitudes were abject
and the expression of their countenances distrustful surprised and startled after we had presented them with some scarlet cloth which they immediately tied round their necks they became good friends this was shown by the old man patting our breasts
as people do when feeding chickens i walked with the old man and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several times it was concluded by three hard slaps which were given me on the breast and back at the same time he then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment which being done
he seemed highly pleased the language of these people according to our notions scarcely deserves to be called articulate captain cook has compared it to a man clearing his throat but certainly no european ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse guttural and clicking sounds
they are excellent mimics as often as we coughed or yawned or made any odd motion they immediately imitated us some of our party began to squint and look awry but one of the young fuegians whose whole face was painted black excepting a white band across his eyes
succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces they could repeat with perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them and they remembered such words for some time yet we europeans all know how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language
which of us for instance could follow an american indian through a sentence of more than three words all savages appear to possess to an uncommon degree this power of mimicry i was told almost in the same words of the same ludicrous habit among the caffres
the australians likewise have long been notorious for being able to imitate and describe the gait of any man so that he may be recognized how can this faculty be explained is it a consequence of the more practised habits of perception and keener senses common to all men in a savage state
as compared with those long civilized when a song was struck up by our party i thought the fuegians would have fallen down with astonishment with equal surprise they viewed our dancing but one of the young men when asked had no objection to a little waltzing
little accustomed to europeans as they appeared to be yet they knew and dreaded our fire arms nothing would tempt them to take a gun in their hands they begged for knives calling them by the spanish word
they explained also what they wanted by acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth and then pretending to cut instead of tear it i have not as yet noticed the fuegians whom we had on board
during the former voyage of the adventure and beagle in eighteen twenty six to eighteen thirty captain fitz roy seized on a party of natives as hostages for the loss of a boat which had been stolen to the great jeopardy of a party employed on the survey
and some of these natives as well as a child whom he bought for a pearl button he took with him to england determining to educate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense to settle these natives in their own country
was one chief inducement to captain fitz roy to undertake our present voyage and before the admiralty had resolved to send out this expedition captain fitz roy had generously chartered a vessel and would himself have taken them back the natives were accompanied by a missionary
r matthews of whom and of the natives captain fitz roy has published a full and excellent account two men one of whom died in england of the small pox a boy and a little girl were originally taken and we had now on board
york minster jemmy button whose name expresses his purchase money and fuegia basket york minster was a full grown short thick powerful man his disposition was reserved taciturn morose
and when excited violently passionate his affections were very strong towards a few friends on board his intellect good jemmy button was a universal favourite but likewise passionate the expression of his face at once showed his nice disposition
he was merry and often laughed and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in pain when the water was rough i was often a little sea sick and he used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice poor poor fellow but the notion after his aquatic life
of a man being sea sick was too ludicrous and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide a smile or laugh
poor poor fellow he was of a patriotic disposition and he liked to praise his own tribe and country
and he abused all the other tribes he stoutly declared that there was no devil in his land jemmy was short thick and fat but vain of his personal appearance he used always to wear gloves
his hair was neatly cut and he was distressed if his well polished shoes were dirtied he was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass and a merry faced little indian boy from the rio negro whom we had for some months on board soon perceived this and used to mock him
too much skylark it seems yet wonderful to me when i think over all his many good qualities that he should have been of the same race and doubtless partaken of the same character with the miserable degraded savages whom we first met here lastly
fuegia basket was a nice modest reserved young girl with a rather pleasing but sometimes sullen expression and very quick in learning anything especially languages this she showed in picking up some portuguese and spanish
although all three could both speak and understand a good deal of english it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from them concerning the habits of their countrymen this was partly owing to their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative
every one accustomed to very young children knows how seldom one can get an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black or white the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their minds so it was with these fuegians
and hence it was generally impossible to find out by cross questioning whether one had rightly understood anything which they had asserted their sight was remarkably acute it is well known that sailors from long practice can make out a distant object much better than a landsman
and jemmy when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch would say me see ship me no tell it was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages when we landed towards jemmy button
they immediately perceived the difference between him and ourselves and held much conversation one with another on the subject the old man addressed a long harangue to jemmy which it seems was to invite him to stay with them
but jemmy understood very little of their language and was moreover thoroughly ashamed of his countrymen when york minster afterwards came on shore they noticed him in the same way and told him he ought to shave yet he had not twenty dwarf hairs on his face whilst we all wore our untrimmed beards
they examined the colour of his skin and compared it with ours one of our arms being bared they expressed the liveliest surprise and admiration at its whiteness just in the same way in which i have seen the ourangoutang do at the zoological gardens
we thought that they mistook two or three of the officers who were rather shorter and fairer though adorned with large beards for the ladies of our party
that i dare say he thought himself the handsomest man in tierra del fuego after our first feeling of grave astonishment was over nothing could be more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which these savages every moment exhibited
the next day i attempted to penetrate some way into the country tierra del fuego may be described as a mountainous land partly submerged in the sea so that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys should exist
the mountain sides except on the exposed western coast are covered from the waters edge upwards by one great forest
and are succeeded by a band of peat with minute alpine plants and this again is succeeded by the line of perpetual snow which according to captain king in the strait of magellan descends to between three thousand and four thousand feet
is most rare i recollect only one little flat piece near port famine and another of rather larger extent near goeree road in both places and everywhere else the surface is covered by a thick bed of swampy peat even within the forest
the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying vegetable matter which from being soaked with water yields to the foot finding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood i followed the course of a mountain torrent
at first from the waterfalls and number of dead trees i could hardly crawl along but the bed of the stream soon became a little more open from the floods having swept the sides i continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and rocky banks
and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene the gloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of violence on every side were lying irregular masses of rock and torn up trees other trees though still erect
were decayed to the heart and ready to fall the entangled mass of the thriving and the fallen reminded me of the forests within the tropics yet there was a difference for in these still solitudes death instead of life seemed the predominant spirit
had cleared a straight space down the mountain side by this road i ascended to a considerable elevation and obtained a good view of the surrounding woods the trees all belong to one kind the fagus betuloides
for the number of the other species of fagus and of the winters bark is quite inconsiderable this beech keeps its leaves throughout the year but its foliage is of a peculiar brownish green colour with a tinge of yellow as the whole landscape is thus coloured
it has a sombre dull appearance nor is it often enlivened by the rays of the sun
about fifteen hundred feet high which captain fitz roy has called after sir j banks in commemoration of his disastrous excursion which proved fatal to two men of his party and nearly so to doctor solander the snow storm which was the cause of their misfortune
we followed the same water course as on the previous day till it dwindled away and we were then compelled to crawl blindly among the trees these from the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds were low thick and crooked
at length we reached that which from a distance appeared like a carpet of fine green turf but which to our vexation turned out to be a compact mass of little beech trees about four or five feet high
they were as thick together as box in the border of a garden and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous surface
a ridge connected this hill with another distant some miles and more lofty so that patches of snow were lying on it as the day was not far advanced i determined to walk there and collect plants along the road
it would have been very hard work had it not been for a well beaten and straight path made by the guanacos for these animals like sheep always follow the same line when we reached the hill we found it the highest in the immediate neighbourhood
and the waters flowed to the sea in opposite directions we obtained a wide view over the surrounding country to the north a swampy moorland extended
well becoming tierra del fuego there was a degree of mysterious grandeur in mountain behind mountain with the deep intervening valleys all covered by one thick dusky mass of forest the atmosphere likewise in this climate
where gale succeeds gale with rain hail and sleet seems blacker than anywhere else in the strait of magellan looking due southward from port famine the distant channels between the mountains appeared from their gloominess to lead beyond the confines of this world
and on the succeeding day favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze we closed in with the barnevelts and running past cape deceit with its stony peaks about three oclock doubled the weather beaten cape horn the evening was calm and bright
and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding isles cape horn however demanded his tribute and before night sent us a gale of wind directly in our teeth we stood out to sea and on the second day again made the land
when we saw on our weather bow this notorious promontory in its proper form veiled in a mist and its dim outline surrounded by a storm of wind and water great black clouds were rolling across the heavens and squalls of rain with hail
that the captain determined to run into wigwam cove this is a snug little harbour not far from cape horn and here at christmas eve we anchored in smooth water the only thing which reminded us of the gale outside
was every now and then a puff from the mountains which made the ship surge at her anchors
rises to the height of seventeen hundred feet the surrounding islands all consist of conical masses of greenstone associated sometimes with less regular hills of baked and altered clay slate this part of tierra del fuego
may be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of mountains already alluded to the cove takes its name of wigwam from some of the fuegian habitations but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so called with equal propriety the inhabitants
living chiefly upon shell fish are obliged constantly to change their place of residence but they return at intervals to the same spots as is evident from the piles of old shells which must often amount to many tons in freight
the fuegian wigwam resembles in size and dimensions a haycock it merely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground and very imperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes the whole cannot be the work of an hour
and it is only used for a few days at goeree roads i saw a place where one of these naked men had slept which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare the man was evidently living by himself
on the west coast however the wigwams are rather better for they are covered with seal skins we were detained here several days by the bad weather the climate is certainly wretched the summer solstice was now passed
yet every day snow fell on the hills and in the valleys there was rain accompanied by sleet the thermometer generally stood
from the damp and boisterous state of the atmosphere
one fancied the climate even worse than it really was while going one day on shore near wollaston island we pulled alongside a canoe with six fuegians these were the most abject and miserable creatures i anywhere beheld
on the east coast the natives as we have seen have guanaco cloaks and on the west they possess seal skins amongst these central tribes the men generally have an otter skin or some small scrap about as large as a pocket handkerchief
which is barely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins it is laced across the breast by strings and according as the wind blows it is shifted from side to side but these fuegians in the canoe were quite naked and even one full grown woman was absolutely so
it was raining heavily and the fresh water together with the spray trickled down her body in another harbour not far distant a woman who was suckling a recently born child came one day alongside the vessel and remained there out of mere curiosity
their voices discordant and their gestures violent viewing such men one can hardly make ones self believe that they are fellow creatures and inhabitants of the same world it is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy
how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to these barbarians at night five or six human beings naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals
whenever it is low water winter or summer night or day they must rise to pick shell fish from the rocks and the women either dive to collect sea eggs or sit patiently in their canoes and with a baited hair line without any hook jerk out little fish
if a seal is killed or the floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered it is a feast and such miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi they often suffer from famine
i heard mister low a sealing master intimately acquainted with the natives of this country give a curious account of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the west coast who were very thin and in great distress
a succession of gales prevented the women from getting shell fish on the rocks and they could not go out in their canoes to catch seal a small party of these men one morning set out and the other indians explained to him that they were going a four days journey for food
as soon as the blubber was brought into a wigwam an old man cut off thin slices and muttering over them broiled them for a minute
who during this time preserved a profound silence mister low believes that whenever a whale is cast on shore the natives bury large pieces of it in the sand as a resource in time of famine and a native boy whom he had on board once found a stock thus buried
the different tribes when at war are cannibals from the concurrent but quite independent evidence of the boy taken by mister low and of jemmy button it is certainly true that when pressed in winter by hunger
they kill and devour their old women before they kill their dogs the boy being asked by mister low why they did this answered doggies catch otters old women no this boy described the manner in which they are killed by being held over smoke and thus choked
he imitated their screams as a joke and described the parts of their bodies which are considered best to eat horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and relatives must be the fears of the old women when hunger begins to press are more painful to think of
but that they are pursued by the men and brought back to the slaughter house at their own firesides captain fitz roy could never ascertain that the fuegians have any distinct belief in a future life they sometimes bury their dead in caves
and sometimes in the mountain forests we do not know what ceremonies they perform jemmy button would not eat land birds because eat dead men they are unwilling even to mention their dead friends we have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious worship
though perhaps the muttering of the old man before he distributed the putrid blubber to his famished party may be of this nature each family or tribe has a wizard or conjuring doctor whose office we could never clearly ascertain jemmy believed in dreams
though not as i have said in the devil i do not think that our fuegians were much more superstitious than some of the sailors for an old quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy gales which we encountered off cape horn were caused by our having the fuegians on board
the nearest approach to a religious feeling which i heard of was shown by york minster
in a wild and excited manner he also related that his brother one day whilst returning to pick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast observed some feathers blown by the wind his brother said york imitating his manner what that
and crawling onwards he peeped over the cliff and saw wild man picking his birds he crawled a little nearer and then hurled down a great stone and killed him york declared for a long time afterwards storms raged and much rain and snow fell
as far as we could make out he seemed to consider the elements themselves as the avenging agents it is evident in this case how naturally in a race a little more advanced in culture the elements would become personified what the bad wild men were
has always appeared to me most mysterious from what york said when we found the place like the form of a hare where a single man had slept the night before
but other obscure speeches made me doubt this i have sometimes imagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane the different tribes have no government or chief yet each is surrounded by other hostile tribes speaking different dialects
and separated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral territory the cause of their warfare appears to be the means of subsistence their country is a broken mass of wild rocks lofty hills and useless forests
and these are viewed through mists and endless storms the habitable land is reduced to the stones on the beach in search of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from spot to spot and so steep is the coast that they can only move about in their wretched canoes
they cannot know the feeling of having a home and still less that of domestic affection for the husband is to the wife a brutal master to a laborious slave was a more horrid deed ever perpetrated than that witnessed on the west coast by byron
who saw a wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant boy whom her husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of sea eggs how little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into play what is there for imagination to picture
for reason to compare or judgment to decide upon to knock a limpet from the rock does not require even cunning that lowest power of the mind their skill in some respects may be compared to the instinct of animals for it is not improved by experience
the canoe their most ingenious work poor as it is has remained the same as we know from drake for the last two hundred and fifty years whilst beholding these savages one asks whence have they come what could have tempted
or what change compelled a tribe of men to leave the fine regions of the north to travel down the cordillera or backbone of america to invent and build canoes which are not used by the tribes of chile peru and brazil
and then to enter on one of the most inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe although such reflections must at first seize on the mind yet we may feel sure that they are partly erroneous there is no reason to believe that the fuegians decrease in number
therefore we must suppose that they enjoy a sufficient share of happiness of whatever kind it may be to render life worth having
i can see now that to children with a proper equipment of parents these things would have worn a different aspect but to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles a special attitude of mind may be allowed they treated us indeed with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh
while there grew up in me as in the parallel case of caliban upon setebos a vague sense of a ruling power wilful and freakish and prone to the practice of vagaries just choosing so
but only a certain blend of envy of their good luck and pity for their inability to make use of it indeed it was one of the most hopeless features in their character when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them which wasnt often
they were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in the full eye of the sun free to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn yet they never did any one of these things no irresistible energy haled them to church o sundays
yet they went there regularly of their own accord though they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves on the whole the existence of these olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests
even as their movements were confined and slow and their habits stereotyped and senseless to anything but appearances they were blind
a place elf haunted wonderful simply produced so many apples and cherries or it didnt when the failures of nature were not infrequently ascribed to us
though the whole place swarmed with such portents they cared not about exploring for robbers caves nor digging for hidden treasure perhaps indeed it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time stuffily indoors
there was an exception in the curate who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo which it was our delight moccasined and tomahawked to ride down with those whoops that announce the scenting of blood
he neither laughed nor sneered as the olympians would have done but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion
then too he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding indians on the shortest possible notice in brief a distinctly able man with talents so far as we could judge immensely above the majority
i trust he is a bishop by this time he had all the necessary qualifications as we knew these strange folk had visitors sometimes stiff and colourless olympians like themselves equally without vital interests and intelligent pursuits
emerging out of the clouds and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken then brute force was pitilessly applied we were captured washed and forced into clean collars
silently submitting as was our wont with more contempt than anger anon with unctuous hair and faces stiffened in a conventional grin
how could reasonable people spend their precious time so
or to hunt bears among the hazels it was incessant matter for amazement how these olympians would talk over our heads during meals for instance of this or the other social or political inanity
under the delusion that these pale phantasms of reality were among the importances of life we illuminati eating silently our heads full of plans and conspiracies could have told them what real life was
we had just left it outside and were all on fire to get back to it of course we didnt waste the revelation on them the futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated one in thought and purpose linked by the necessity of combating one hostile fate
than the kindly beasts who shared our natural existence in the sun the estrangement was fortified by an abiding sense of injustice
or admit themselves in the wrong or to accept similar concessions on our part for instance when i flung the cat out of an upper window though i did it from no ill feeling and it didnt hurt the cat
but was the matter allowed to end there i trow not again when harold was locked up in his room all day for assault and battery upon a neighbours pig an action he would have scorned being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in question
there was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery of the real culprit what harold had felt was not so much the imprisonment indeed he had very soon escaped by the window with assistance from his allies and had only gone back in time for his release as the olympian habit
well the olympians are all past and gone somehow the sun does not seem to shine so brightly as it used the trackless meadows of old time have shrunk and dwindled away to a few poor acres
a saddening doubt a dull suspicion creeps over me et in arcadia ego
the masterful wind was up and out shouting and chasing the lord of the morning poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish dead leaves sprang aloft and whirled into space and all the clear swept heaven seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp
it was one of the first awakenings of the year the earth stretched herself smiling in her sleep and everything leapt and pulsed to the stir of the giants movement with us it was a whole holiday the occasion a birthday it matters not whose
some one of us had had presents and pretty conventional speeches and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it but the holiday was for all the rapture of awakening nature for all
the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedge breaking for all colt like i ran through the meadows frisking happy heels in the face of nature laughing responsive above the sky was bluest of the blue wide pools left by the winters floods
flashed the colour back true and brilliant and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch that seemed to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts out into the brimming sun bathed world i sped free of lessons
oh hes just playin muffin man as usual said charlotte with petulance fancy wanting to be a muffin man on a whole holiday it was a strange craze certainly but harold who invented his own games and played them without assistance
always stuck staunchly to a new fad till he had worn it quite out just at present he was a muffin man
and offering phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers
to pass along busy streets of your own building for ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging crowd of your own creation there were points about the game it cannot be denied though it seemed scarce in harmony with this radiant wind swept morning
only you mustnt say i told you cos its to be a surprise all right i said magnanimously
but i could not help feeling that on this day of days even a grizzly felt misplaced and common sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as we dropped into the road then ensued shrieks growlings revolver shots and unrecorded heroisms
and the age of acorns have displaced our hard won civilisation
do shouted edward valiantly i should i should i should
he beat the unicorn observed harold dubiously all round the town that proves he was a good lion cried edwards triumphantly but the question is how are you to tell em when you see em i should ask martha said harold of the simple creed
and ill run on to that corner and be a lion
no i wont i swear i wont protested edward ill be quite a new lion this time something you cant even imagine and he raced off to his post charlotte hesitated then she went timidly on
at each step growing less charlotte the mummer of a minute and more the anxious pilgrim of all time the lions wrath waxed terrible at her approach his roaring filled the startled air
into the vacant meadow spaces
but the passion and the call of the divine morning were high in my blood earth to earth that was the frank note the joyous summons of the day and they could not but jar and seem artificial these human discussions and pretences
the pant and smoke of a distant train all were wine or song was it or odour this unity they all blended into i had no words then to describe it that earth effluence of which i was so conscious nor indeed have i found words since
i ran sideways shouting i dug glad heels into the squelching soil i splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick i hurled clods skywards at random and presently i somehow found myself singing
a weary unrhythmic thing of rise and fall and yet it seemed to me a genuine utterance and just at that moment the one thing fitting and right and perfect humanity would have rejected it with scorn nature everywhere singing in the same key
recognised and accepted it without a flicker of dissent all the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where he swung and bellowed in the tree tops
a belated truant you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale expressionless moon for company to day why not i the trickster the hypocrite i who whip round corners and bluster relapse and evade then rally and pursue
i can lead you the best and rarest dance of any for i am the strong capricious one the lord of misrule and i alone am irresponsible and unprincipled and obey no law and for me i was ready enough to fall in with the fellows humour was not this a whole holiday
so we sheered off together arm in arm so to speak and with fullest confidence i took the jigging thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me a whimsical comrade i found him ere he had done with me
silent face to face oer a discreet unwinking stile as a rule this sort of thing struck me as the most pitiful tomfoolery two calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and right and within the order of things but that human beings
with salient interests and active pursuits beckoning them on from every side could thus
and it was with a certain surprise that i found myself regarding these fatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt as i rambled by unheeded of them there was indeed some reconciling influence abroad which could bring the like antics into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic air
and presently i came in sight of the village church sitting solitary within its circle of elms from forth the vestry window projected two small legs gyrating hungry for foothold with larceny
bills coveted booty too i could easily guess at that it came from the vicars store of biscuits kept as i knew
then i passed on my way i protest i was not on bills side but then neither was i on the vicars
and i felt sure as i rambled off in his wake that he had more holiday matter to show me and so indeed he had and all of it was to the same lawless tune like a black pirate flag on the blue ocean of air a hawk hung ominous then plummet wise dropped to the hedgerow
whence there rose thin and shrill a piteous voice of squealing by the time i got there a whisk of feathers on the turf like scattered playbills was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just enacted yet nature smiled and sang on pitiless gay impartial
to her who took no sides there was every bit as much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch both were her children and she would show no preferences further on a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path nay more than dead decadent distinctly
a sorry sight for one that had known the fellow in more bustling circumstances nature might at least have paused to shed one tear over this rough jacketed little son of hers for his wasted aims his cancelled ambitions his whole career of usefulness cut suddenly short but not a bit of it
jubilant as ever her song went bubbling on and death in life and again life in death were its alternate burdens and looking round and seeing the sheep nibbled heels of turnips that dotted the ground their hearts eaten out of them in frost bound days now over and done
i seemed to discern faintly a something of the stern meaning in her valorous chant my invisible companion was singing also and seemed at times to be chuckling softly to himself doubtless at thought of the strange new lessons he was teaching me
perhaps too at a special bit of waggishness he had still in store for when at last he grew weary of such insignificant earthbound company he deserted me at a certain spot i knew then dropped subsided and slunk away into nothingness
stood the ancient whipping post of the village its sides fretted with the initials of a generation that scorned its mute lesson but still clipped by the stout rusty shackles that had tethered the wrists
had i been an infant sterne here was a grand chance for sentimental output as things were i could only hurry homewards my moral tail well between my legs with an uneasy feeling as i glanced back over my shoulder that there was more in this chance than met the eye
harold it further appeared greatly coveting tadpoles and top heavy with the eagerness of possession had fallen into the pond this in itself was nothing but on attempting to sneak in
by the back door he had rendered up his duckweed bedabbled person into the hands of an aunt and had been promptly sent off to bed and this on a holiday was very much

chapter fifteen waiting
said professor bhaer coming in one day early in january please tell it at once i cant bear to wait fritz cried missus jo dropping her work and standing up as if to take the shot bravely but we must wait and hope hearts dearest come
and let us bear it together emils ship is lost and as yet no news of him it was well mister bhaer had taken his wife into his strong arms for she looked ready to drop but bore up after a moment
and sitting by her good man heard all that there was to tell tidings had been sent to the shipowners at hamburg by some of the survivors and telegraphed at once by franz to his uncle as one boat load was safe
there was hope that others might also escape though the gale had sent two to the bottom a swift sailing steamer had brought these scanty news and happier ones might come at any hour but kind franz had not added that the sailors reported the captains boat as undoubtedly wrecked by the falling mast
even when hope waxed faint and her heart was heavy if anything could comfort the bhaers for the loss of one boy
franz kept the cable busy with his varying messages nat sent loving letters from leipzig and tom harassed the shipping agents for news even busy jack wrote them with unusual warmth
dolly and george came often bearing the loveliest flowers and the daintiest bon bons to cheer missus bhaer and sweeten josies grief while good hearted ned travelled all the way from chicago to press their hands and say with a tear in his eye
i was so anxious to hear all about the dear old boy i couldnt keep away thats right comfortable and shows me that if i didnt teach my boys anything else i did give them the brotherly love that will make them stand by one another all their lives said missus jo when he had gone
had they all been true the elders bore it quietly having learned submission in lifes hard school but the younger people rebelled some hoped against hope and kept up others despaired at once and little josie emils pet cousin and playmate was so broken hearted
nothing could comfort her nan dosed in vain daisys cheerful words went by like the wind and besss devices to amuse her all failed utterly to cry in mothers arms and talk about the wreck which haunted her even in her sleep was all she cared to do
and missus meg was getting anxious when miss cameron sent josie a kind note
and be like the self sacrificing heroines she loved to act
for the boy was deeply impressed by this sudden eclipse of the firefly whose light and life all missed when they were gone and lured her out every day for long drives behind the black mare who shook her silvery bells till they made such merry music josie could not help listening to it
and whisked her over the snowy roads at a pace which set the blood dancing in her veins and sent her home strengthened and comforted by sunshine fresh air and congenial society three aids young sufferers seldom can resist
some regret for faults that lie heavy on the conscience when the one sinned against is gone and all of them the solemn lesson to be ready when the summons comes a hush lay over plumfield for weeks and the studious faces on the hill reflected the sadness of those in the valley
then up went the flag out rang the college bells bang went teddys long unused cannon and a chorus of happy voices cried thank god as people went about laughing crying and embracing one another in a rapture of delight
for missus jo carried them in her pocket when mister bhaer did not have them in his and both took a look at them when they said their prayers at night now the professor was heard humming like a big bee again as he went to his classes
and let her romances wait now messages of congratulation flowed in and beaming faces showed everywhere rob amazed his parents by producing a poem which was remarkably good for one of his years and demi set it to music that it might be sung when the sailor boy returned
teddy stood on his head literally and tore about the neighbourhood on octoo like a second paul revere only his tidings were good but best of all little josie lifted up her head as the snowdrops did and began to bloom again growing tall and quiet
with the shadow of past sorrow to tone down her former vivacity and show that she had learned a lesson in trying to act well her part on the real stage where all have to take their share in the great drama of life
there was great scrubbing and dusting among the matrons as they set their houses in order not only for class day but to receive the bride and groom who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip great plans were made gifts prepared and much joy felt at the prospect of seeing franz again
though emil who was to accompany them would be the greater hero little did the dear souls dream what a surprise was in store for them as they innocently laid their plans and wished all the boys could be there to welcome home their eldest and their casablanca
while they wait and work so happily let us see how our other absent boys are faring as they too wait and work and hope for better days nat was toiling steadily along the path he had wisely chosen though it was by no means strewn with flowers
quite thorny was it in fact and hard to travel after the taste of ease and pleasure he had got when nibbling at forbidden fruit but his crop of wild oats was a light one and he resolutely reaped what he had sowed finding some good wheat among the tares he taught by day
he fiddled night after night in the dingy little theatre and he studied so diligently that his master was well pleased and kept him in mind as one to whom preferment was due if any chance occurred gay friends forgot him but the old ones stood fast
and cheered him up when heimweh and weariness made him sad as spring came on things mended expenses grew less work pleasanter and life more bearable than when wintry storms beat on his thinly clad back
and frost pinched the toes that patiently trudged in old boots no debts burdened him the year of absence was nearly over and if he chose to stay herr bergmann had hopes for him that would bring independence for a time at least
so he walked under the lindens with a lighter heart and in the may evenings went about the city with a band of strolling students making music before houses where he used to sit as guest
and once minna threw him money which he humbly received as part of his penance being morbid on the subject of his sins his reward came sooner than he expected and was greater than he deserved he thought though his heart leaped with joy when his master one day informed him
that he was chosen with several other of his most promising pupils to join the musical society which was to take part in the great festival in london the next july here was not only honour for the violinist but happiness for the man as it brought him nearer home
as the great bergmann seldom praised his pupils these words filled nats soul with pride and joy and he worked yet more diligently than before to fulfil his masters prophecy he thought the trip to england happiness enough but found room for more when early in june
kind wishes and comfortable gifts for the lonely fellow who could have fallen on their necks and cried like a girl at seeing his old mates again how glad he was to be found in his little room busy at his proper work not living like an idle gentleman on borrowed money
how proud he was to tell his plans assure them that he had no debts and receive their praises for his improvement in music their respect for his economy and steadfastness in well doing
how relieved when having honestly confessed his shortcomings they only laughed and owned that they also had known like experiences and were the wiser for them he was to go to the wedding late in june and join his comrades in london
as best man he could not refuse the new suit franz insisted on ordering for him and a cheque from home about that time made him feel like a millionaire and a happy one for this was accompanied by such kind letters full of delight in his success
he had found the little guide book that christian carried in his bosom and love penitence and prayer the three sweet sisters had given him the armour which would keep him safe he had not learned to wear it yet and chafed against it though he felt its value
thanks to the faithful friend who had stood by him all that bitter year soon he was to be free again worn and scarred in the fray
when he thought of it dan felt as if he could not wait but must burst that narrow cell and fly away as the caddis worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony coffins to climb the ferns and soar into the sky night after night he lulled himself to sleep with planning how
and the old free life would keep him safe from the temptations that beset him in cities by and by when im all right again and have something to tell that im not ashamed of ill go home he said with a quicker beat of the impetuous heart that longed to be there so intensely
as he remembered what it had done since a certain little white hand had laid in it confidingly ill make em proud of me yet and no one shall ever know of this awful year i can wipe it out and i will so help me god
and now our family is very well represented in the old orchard said chebec proudly slowly peter reached over his back with his long left hind foot and thoughtfully scratched his long right ear
he didnt like to admit that he couldnt recall those two cousins of chebecs did you say your fighting cousin he asked in a hesitating way thats what i said replied chebec he is scrapper the kingbird as of course you know
the rest of us always feel safe when he is about of course i know him declared peter his face clearing where is he now
at that very instant a great racket broke out on the other side of the old orchard and in no time at all the feathered folks were hurrying from every direction screaming at the top of their voices
of course peter couldnt be left out of anything like that and he scampered for the scene of trouble as fast as his legs could take him
and this way and that way as if trying to get away from something or somebody for a minute peter couldnt think what was the trouble with redtail and then he saw
a white throated white breasted bird having a black cap and back and a broad white band across the end of his tail was darting at redtail as if he meant to pull out every feather in the latters coat
he was just a little smaller than welcome robin and in comparison with him redtail was a perfect giant but this seemed to make no difference to scrapper for that is who it was
he wasnt afraid and he intended that everybody should know it especially redtail it is because of his fearlessness that he is called kingbird all the time he was screaming at the top of his lungs calling redtail a robber and every other bad name he could think of
all the other birds joined him in calling redtail bad names but none not even bully the english sparrow was brave enough to join him in attacking big redtail when he had succeeded in driving redtail far enough from the old orchard to suit him
scrapper flew back and perched on a dead branch of one of the trees where he received the congratulations of all his feathered neighbors he took them quite modestly assuring them that he had done nothing
peter couldnt help but admire scrapper for his courage as peter looked up at scrapper he saw that like all the rest of the flycatchers there was just the tiniest of hooks on the end of his bill
scrappers slightly raised cap seemed all black but if peter could have gotten close enough he would have found that hidden in it was a patch of orange red while peter sat staring up at him scrapper suddenly darted out into the air
and his bill snapped in quite the same way chebecs did when he caught a fly but it wasnt a fly that scrapper had it was a bee peter saw it very distinctly just as scrapper snapped it up
it reminded peter that he had often heard scrapper called the bee martin and now he understood why do you live on bees altogether asked peter
there wouldnt be any honey if i did
those that i do catch are mostly drones and you know the drones are useless they do no work at all it is only by accident that i now and then catch a worker i eat all kinds of insects that fly and some that dont
im one of farmer browns best friends if he did but know it you can talk all you please about the wonderful eyesight of the members of the hawk family but if any one of them has better eyesight than i have id like to know who it is
theres a fly way over there beyond that old apple tree watch me catch it peter knew better than to waste any effort trying to see that fly he knew that he couldnt have seen it had it been only one fourth that distance away
but if he couldnt see the fly he could hear the sharp click of scrappers bill and he knew by the way scrapper kept opening and shutting his mouth after his return that he had caught that fly and it had tasted good
are you going to build in the old orchard this year asked peter of course i am declared scrapper i just then he spied blacky the crow and dashed out to meet him
turning away toward the green meadows instead peter didnt wait for scrapper to return
just as he was leaving the far corner of the old orchard some one called him peter oh peter rabbit called the voice peter stopped abruptly sat up very straight looked this way looked that way and looked the other way
every way but the right way look up over your head cried the voice rather a harsh voice
it was cresty the great crested flycatcher he was a wee bit bigger than scrapper the kingbird yet not quite so big as welcome robin and more slender
his throat and breast were gray shading into bright yellow underneath his back and head were of a grayish brown with a tint of olive green a pointed cap was all that was needed to make him quite distinguished looking
you seem to be in a hurry so dont let me detain you peter said cresty before peter could find his tongue i just want to ask one little favor of you what is it asked peter who
if in your roaming about you run across an old cast off suit of mister black snake or of any other member of the snake family i wish you would remember me and let me know will you peter said cresty a a
a what stammered peter a cast off suit of clothes from any member of the snake family replied cresty somewhat impatiently now dont forget peter ive got to go house hunting but youll find me there or hereabouts if it happens that you find one of those
cast off snake suits before peter could say another word cresty had flown away peter hesitated looking first towards the dear old briar patch and then towards jenny wrens house
he just couldnt understand about those cast off suits of the snake family and he felt sure that jenny wren could tell him finally curiosity got the best of him and back he scampered lipperty lipperty lip to the foot of the tree in which jenny wren had her home
jenny called peter jenny wren jenny wren no one answered him he could hear mister wren singing in another tree but he couldnt see him jenny jenny wren jenny wren called peter again
this time jenny popped her head out and her little eyes fairly snapped didnt i tell you the other day peter rabbit that im not to be disturbed didnt i tell you that ive got seven eggs in here and that i cant spend any time gossiping
didnt i peter rabbit didnt i didnt i you certainly did jenny you certainly did and im sorry to disturb you replied peter meekly i wouldnt have thought of doing such a thing but i just didnt know who else to go to
go to for what snapped jenny wren what is it youve come to me for snake skins replied peter snake skins snake skins shrieked jenny wren
you dont understand cried peter hurriedly what i want to know is why should cresty the flycatcher ask me to please let him know if i found any cast off suits of the snake family
he flew away before i could ask him why he wants them and so i came to you because i know you know everything especially everything concerning your neighbors
with this jenny wren disappeared inside her house and there was nothing for peter to do but once more start for the dear old briar patch on his way he couldnt resist the temptation to run over to the green forest which was just beyond the old orchard
he just had to find out if there was anything new over there hardly had he reached it when he heard a plaintive voice crying pee wee pee wee pee wee peter chuckled happily
he usually is one of the last of the flycatcher family to arrive i didnt expect to find him yet i wonder what has brought him up so early
it didnt take peter long to find pewee he just followed the sound of that voice and presently saw pewee fly out and make the same kind of a little circle as the other members of the family make when they are hunting flies
it ended just where it had started on a dead twig of a tree in a shady rather lonely part of the green forest almost at once he began to call his name in a rather sad plaintive tone pee wee pee wee pee wee
but he wasnt sad as peter well knew it was his way of expressing how happy he felt he was a little bigger than his cousin chebec but looked very much like him there was a little notch in the end of his tail
the upper half of his bill was black but the lower half was light peter could see on each wing two whitish bars and he noticed that pewees wings were longer than his tail which wasnt the case with chebec
but no one could ever mistake pewee for any of his relatives for the simple reason that he keeps repeating his own name over and over arent you here early asked peter pewee nodded
that is something i dont often do if you please peter inquired politely why do folks call you wood pewee pewee chuckled happily
it is so quiet and restful that i love it missus pewee and i are very retiring we do not like too many near neighbors you wont mind if i come to see you once in a while will you asked peter as he prepared to start on again for the dear old briar patch
come as often as you like replied pewee the oftener the better back in the old briar patch peter thought over all he had learned about the flycatcher family and as he recalled how they were forever catching all sorts of flying insects it suddenly struck him
that they must be very useful little people in helping old mother nature take care of her trees and other growing things which insects so dearly love to destroy
but most of all peter thought about that queer request of crestys and a dozen times that day he found himself peeping under old logs in the hope of finding a cast off coat of mister black snake
it was such a funny thing for cresty to ask for that peters curiosity would allow him no peace and the next morning he was up in the old orchard before jolly mister sun had kicked his bedclothes off
jenny wren was as good as her word while she flitted and hopped about this way and that way in that fussy way of hers getting her breakfast she talked jenny couldnt keep her tongue still if she wanted to did you find any old clothes of the snake family she demanded
then as peter shook his head her tongue ran on without waiting for him to reply cresty and his wife always insist upon having a piece of snake skin in their nest said she why they want it goodness knows but
perhaps they think it will scare robbers away as for me i should have a cold chill every time i got into my nest if i had to sit on anything like that i have to admit that cresty and his wife are a handsome couple
and they certainly have good sense in choosing a house more sense than any other member of their family to my way of thinking but snake skins ugh by the way where does cresty build asked peter
in a hole in a tree like the rest of us sensible people retorted jenny wren promptly peter looked quite as surprised as he felt does cresty make the hole he asked goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny wren
where are your eyes peter did you ever see a flycatcher with a bill that looked as if it could cut wood she didnt wait for a reply but rattled on it is a good thing for a lot of us that the woodpecker family are so fond of new houses look
there is downy the woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute thats good i like to see that it means that next year there will be one more house for some one here in the old orchard for myself i prefer old houses
ive noticed there are a number of my neighbors who feel the same way about it there is something settled about an old house it doesnt attract attention the way a new one does so long as it has got reasonably good walls and the rain and the wind cant get in
the older it is the better it suits me but the woodpeckers seem to like new houses best which as i said before is a very good thing for the rest of us
winsome bluebird stupid snapped jenny wren peter grinned and looked foolish of course said he i forgot all about winsome and skimmer the tree swallow added jenny thats so i ought to have remembered him exclaimed peter
ive noticed that he is very fond of the same house year after year is there anybody else again jenny wren nodded yank yank the nuthatch uses an old house im told but he usually goes up north for his nesting said she
tommy tit the chickadee sometimes uses an old house then again he and missus chickadee get fussy and make a house for themselves yellow wing the flicker who really is a woodpecker often uses an old house but quite often makes a new one
then there are killy the sparrow hawk and spooky the screech owl peter looked surprised i didnt suppose they nested in holes in trees he exclaimed they certainly do mores the pity snapped jenny
it would be a good thing for the rest of us if they didnt nest at all but they do and an old house of yellow wing the flicker suits either of them killy always uses one that is high up and comes back to it year after year
spooky isnt particular so long as the house is big enough to be comfortable he lives in it more or less the year around now i must get back to those eggs of mine ive talked quite enough for one morning oh jenny cried peter as a sudden thought struck him
jenny paused and jerked her tail impatiently well what is it now she demanded have you got two homes asked peter goodness gracious no exclaimed jenny
one is all i can take care of then why demanded peter triumphantly does mister wren work all day carrying sticks and straws into a hole in another tree it seems to me that he has carried enough in there to build two or three nests
he wasnt ready to go back home to the dear old briar patch yet there seemed nothing else to do for everybody in the old orchard was too busy for idle gossip peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot trying to think of some place to go
ill just run over and pay my respects to grandfather frog and to redwing the blackbird redwing was one of the first birds to arrive and ive neglected him shamefully when peter thinks of something to do he wastes no time
off he started lipperty lipperty lip for the smiling pool he kept close to the edge of the green forest until he reached the place where the laughing brook comes out of the green forest on its way to the smiling pool in the green meadows
bushes and young trees grow along the banks of the laughing brook at this point the ground was soft in places quite muddy peter doesnt mind getting his feet damp so he hopped along carelessly
from right under his very nose something shot up into the air with a whistling sound it startled peter so that he stopped short with his eyes popping out of his head
he had just a glimpse of a brown form disappearing over the tops of some tall bushes then peter chuckled
he scared me for a second then you are even said a voice close at hand you scared him i saw you coming but longbill didnt peter turned quickly there was missus woodcock peeping at him from behind a tussock of grass
i didnt mean to scare him apologized peter i really didnt mean to do you think he was really very much scared
i recognized you just as i was disappearing over the tops of the bushes so i came right back i learned when i was very young that when startled it is best to fly first and find out afterwards whether or not there is real danger
i am glad it is no one but you peter for i was having a splendid meal here and i should have hated to leave it youll excuse me while i go on eating i hope we can talk between bites
certainly ill excuse you replied peter staring around very hard to see what it could be longbill was making such a good meal of but peter couldnt see a thing that looked good to eat there wasnt even a bug or a worm crawling on the ground
longbill took two or three steps in rather a stately fashion peter had to hide a smile for longbill had such an air of importance yet at the same time was such an odd looking fellow
he was quite a little bigger than welcome robin his tail was short his legs were short and his neck was short but his bill was long enough to make up
his back was a mixture of gray brown black and buff while his breast and under parts were a beautiful reddish buff it was his head that made him look queer
his eyes were very big and they were set so far back that peter wondered if it wasnt easier for him to look behind him than in front of him suddenly longbill plunged his bill into the ground he plunged it in for the whole length
then he pulled it out and peter caught a glimpse of the tail end of a worm disappearing down longbills throat where that long bill had gone into the ground was a neat little round hole
for the first time peter noticed that there were many such little round holes all about did you make all those little round holes exclaimed peter
and was there a worm in every one asked peter his eyes very wide with interest longbill nodded
peter remembered how he had watched welcome robin listen and then suddenly plunge his bill into the ground and pull out a worm but the worms welcome robin got were always close to the surface
while these worms were so deep in the earth that peter couldnt understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there
and how is it possible for you to open your bill down there to take him in asked peter longbill chuckled
longbill suddenly thrust his bill straight out in front of him and to peters astonishment he lifted the end of the upper half without opening the rest of his bill at all thats the way i get them said he
i think there is one right under my feet now watch me get him longbill bored into the ground until his head was almost against it when he pulled his bill out sure enough there was a worm of course explained longbill it is only in soft ground that i can do this
that is why i have to fly away south as soon as the ground freezes at all its wonderful sighed peter i dont suppose any one else can find hidden worms that way my cousin jack snipe can replied longbill promptly
he feeds the same way i do only he likes marshy meadows instead of brushy swamps perhaps you know him peter nodded i do said he now you speak of it there is a strong family resemblance although i hadnt thought of him as a relative of yours before
now i must be running along im ever so glad to have seen you and im coming over to call again the first chance i get so peter said good by and kept on down the laughing brook to the smiling pool right where the laughing brook entered the smiling pool
there was a little pebbly beach running along the very edge of the water was a slim trim little bird with fairly long legs a long slender bill brownish gray back with black spots and markings and a white waistcoat neatly spotted with black
every few steps he would stop to pick up something then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered back and forth like a seesaw
it was teeter the spotted sandpiper an old friend of peters peter greeted him joyously
before peter could say another word teeter came running towards him and it was plain to see that teeter was very anxious about something dont move peter rabbit dont move he cried why not demanded peter for he could see no danger and could think of no reason why he shouldnt move
just then missus teeter came hurrying up and squatted down in the sand right in front of peter thank goodness exclaimed teeter still bobbing and bowing if you had taken another step peter rabbit you would have stepped right on our eggs you gave me a dreadful start
missus teeter stood up and stepped aside then peter saw right in a little hollow in the sand with just a few bits of grass for a lining four white eggs with big dark blotches on them
they looked so much like the surrounding pebbles that he never would have seen them in the world but for missus teeter peter hastily backed away a few steps missus teeter slipped back on the eggs and settled herself comfortably
it suddenly struck peter that if he hadnt seen her do it he wouldnt have known she was there
my he exclaimed i certainly would have stepped on those eggs if you hadnt warned me said he im so thankful i didnt i dont see how you dare lay them in the open like this
the native inhabitants of the pacific slope the explorers and early settlers found a native race occupying nearly every portion of our continent these people had many characteristics in common and were all called indians
in the western portion of the country where the surface is broken by numerous barriers such as mountains and deserts almost every valley was found to be occupied by a distinct group of indians called a tribe
the language of each tribe differed so much from the languages of adjoining tribes that they could with difficulty understand one another these tribes were almost continually at war
the indians upon the pacific slope were generally found to be inferior in most respects to those living in the central and eastern portions of the continent one might suppose that the tribes possessing the fair and fertile valleys of california
would be the most advanced in civilization but such was not the case many of them were among the most degraded upon the continent they seemed unable to adapt themselves to the white man and his ways
and in the older settled districts they have now nearly disappeared in the newer portions of the northwest and along the coast toward alaska the indians have not yet come into so direct contact with the white men
they did not cultivate the soil nor did they hunt a great deal although the country abounded with game
these indians have often been called diggers because they depended so largely for their living upon the roots which they dug it would seem natural that about san francisco bay the natives should have used canoes
but according to early travellers they had none when they wished to go out upon the water they built rafts of bundles of rushes or tules tied together at favorable points along the shore the indians collected for their feasts
and these spots are now indicated by heaps of shells in some places forming mounds of considerable size
in the mountains the sites of the villages are marked by chips of obsidian a volcanic glass used in making arrow tips and by holes in the flat surfaces of granitic rocks near some spring or stream
these holes were made for the purpose of grinding acorns or nuts many of the indian tribes developed great skill in the weaving of baskets which they used for many different purposes
the baskets are still made in some places and are much sought after because of their beauty the indians of northern california in building their homes dug round shallow holes over which poles were bent in the form of a half circle
and after he had entered and all openings were closed he poured water upon the stones until the room was filled with steam after enduring this process as long as he desired the indian came out and plunged into the cold water of a near by stream
as may be imagined such a bath often resulted disastrously to the weak or sick the fact that the california indians could support themselves without any great exertion
at certain seasons of the year when salmon were plentiful each tribe or group of indians established its camp near one of the many rapids and waterfalls along the columbia river large numbers of the salmon were caught by the use of traps
after being partly dried they were packed in bales for winter use the fish thus prepared were considered very valuable and formed an article of trade with the tribes living farther from the river
but this enthusiasm quickly disappears if a head wind comes up and the party goes ashore to wait for the breeze to turn in a more favorable direction these indians as might be supposed live largely upon fish
berries are abundant during the summer and are also much used for food the clothing of the indians was originally a sort of blanket made of the woven fibres of cedar bark or more rarely of the skins of animals
and leaving it there while the head is growing
the buildings are strung along the shore close under the edge of the thick forest and just above the reach of the waves at high tide they are very solidly constructed
for these indians do not move about as much as those farther south where the forests are less dense figure sixty five shows the framework of a partially built house while another stands at one side completed
large posts are set in the ground at the corners and ends of the building cross logs are then placed upon the middle posts
this is sometimes two feet in diameter and from sixty to eighty feet long it must require the united strength of many men to roll such a log into position upon the framework thus constructed split cedar boards are fastened
and the building is practically finished such a house is usually occupied by a number of families upon queen charlotte islands there is a dwelling of this kind large enough to hold seven hundred indians
the fronts of the houses are ornamented with figures hewn out of wood these represent men birds and animals and have a religious significance sometimes these figures are mounted upon the tops of tall poles
the totem pole is a most interesting affair figure sixty six represents the pole at alert bay east of vancouver island it is one of the finest upon the north coast
the figures of animals and birds carved upon it represent the mythological ancestors of the family or clan in front of whose abode the pole stands the indians often hunt similar animals to day
but believe that their ancestors had supernatural power which raised them above the ordinary creatures the chinook indians live upon the lower columbia
the name chinook has been given to a warm dry wind which blows down the eastern slope of the rocky mountains and out upon the great plains this wind is so named because it blows from the direction of the chinook indians country
the chinook jargon is a strange sort of mixed language with which nearly all the tribes of the northwest are familiar it is formed of words from the chinook language together with others from different indian languages
it seems almost certain that these american indians originally came across the narrow strip of water separating asia from america we do not know how long the indians have occupied our country
but it has probably been several thousand years some of the main groups have undoubtedly been here longer than others
theres no sense in wasting our time here said solomon owl to his small cousin simon screecher its a fine night the mice will all be out sooner or later lets go over and sit in that old oak on the edge of the meadow
simon screecher was more than willing and they had no sooner settled themselves among the bare branches of the oak when simon started to amuse himself by giving his well known quavering whistle solomon owl stopped him quickly
dont do that he said sharply do you want to scare the mice simon screecher cut his whistle off right in the middle of it i forgot he murmured but i dont believe my whistling would do any harm
i dont think there are many mice left on farmer greens place its my opinion that theyve moved away most of them or maybe old rough leg the hawk has caught more than his share
solomon owl made no reply he was a person of few words if anybody asked his opinion he was ready to give it but he seldom gave any unsought advice
ive about made up my mind said simon screecher that id move to some other neighborhood if i knew where there was good mousing id move to morrow while he was speaking solomon owl started ever so slightly
you might as well send them a telegram saying that youll be on hand to meet them at eight p m simon screecher was silenced for the time being and it wasnt long before solomon owl gave another start theres that squeak again he whispered
i believe it is getting nearer too now master meadow mouse had a tunnel that led right beneath the tree where the two cousins were sitting
and he had strolled that way after scurrying under the snow when he heard solomon owl laughing in the woods earlier in the evening it was he that solomon heard it was he that stuck his head out of a hole in the snow and peeped up at the star sprinkled sky
he must have hurried over here from the woods he must be very hungry as solomon owl returned to the old oak his cousin simon screecher laughed somewhat unpleasantly missed him didnt you he inquired yes
why didnt you grab him out of the snow simon asked what are your claws for whats your beak for i couldnt dig him out solomon owl replied the snow is three feet deep
and it has seven different crusts one under another this is a hard winter said simon screecher i wish id gone south last fall i wonder how the mousing is down there
eating a tree as simon screecher remarked to his cousin solomon owl it was a hard winter the snow was deep the days were cold and the nights were colder and worst of all food became scarce
it seemed as if there wasnt anything to eat anywhere except at the farm buildings which farmer green had stuffed full of hay and grain during the summer and autumn many of the forest folk stole down from blue mountain after nightfall
and visited the farmyard in the hope of getting a bite of something or other even master meadow mouse began to find it harder and harder to get enough seeds under the snow to satisfy his hunger
he had stored away a stock of food but it hadnt been big enough and that was a great mistake master meadow mouse promised himself that he would not repeat it another time
unfortunately all the promises in the world wouldnt give him a square meal when he needed one
this is my first winter master meadow mouse explained im running short of food and i wish youd tell me what to do in such a case thats easy his cousin answered get more
and then he hurried away for he had important business to attend to poor master meadow mouse ran after him it was hard to follow his cousin through the winding galleries beneath the snow
several times master meadow mouse took the wrong turn and had to retrace his steps but at last he found his busy cousin again you advised me to get more food said master meadow mouse but you didnt tell me where to get it
in the orchard his cousin cried and then he hurried away again i wish hed wait a minute master meadow mouse grumbled as he tore after his cousin once more
i dont feel like running i havent had a hearty meal for days the cousin seemed surprised when master meadow mouse overtook him what that busy gentleman exclaimed have you been to the orchard and back so soon no
having said those three words he dashed off again even faster than before trees master meadow mouse echoed i cant eat trees
there must be something that my cousin forgot to explain so i suppose ill have to run after him again and ask him what he meant the fourth time that master meadow mouse found his cousin he took no chances
he caught his cousin by his tail and held on firmly youre not going to get away from me till ive found out what i want to know he declared how can i eat a tree master meadow mouse demanded you cant
his cousin replied struggling desperately to free himself for he was too busy to stop long then explain what you mean master meadow mouse cried eat the bark his cousin answered
then and not till then did master meadow mouse let him go master meadow mouse chased his cousin no more but hurried away to farmer greens orchard where he gnawed a ring
but farmer green didnt agree with him when he happened to go into the orchard one day later and saw tree after tree ruined he was very very much displeased
i ought to have put wire netting around those young trees he told the hired man this is what comes of a hard winter
a cold dip in one way peter mink was like master meadow mouse he enjoyed swimming and he spent a great deal of his time along the streams that threaded their way through pleasant valley sometimes peter dawdled on the banks of swift river
sometimes he lingered for days in the neighborhood of black creek nor did he disdain so small a stream as the brook that crossed the meadow it was deep enough for a swim and he knew that muskrats lived under its banks
well peter mink had surprised many a one swimming in the brook if it hadnt been for the meadow mice perhaps he wouldnt have visited the brook so often even in winter master meadow mouse just had to have his cold dip now and then
just because there was skating for johnnie green on top of the brook it mustnt be supposed that master meadow mouse wasnt going to have a swim when he wanted one
when peter mink wandered along a stream in winter he preferred to travel under the ice rather than walk upon the upper side of it
it made little difference to him whether there was a dry strip along the edge of the stream where he could steal silently along without wetting his feet when he found no place to walk he swam now master meadow mouse was well aware of this trick of peter minks
this trick of lurking beneath the ice of river creek and brook but master meadow mouse would have his cold dip now and then despite peter mink and his prowling ways to be sure master meadow mouse tried to be careful
before he crept from the end of his tunnel he stuck his head out and looked up and down and all around he peeped under the bank of the brook he even stared into the water and then if he saw nobody that was fiercer than paddy muskrat
only then would he venture to skip to the waters edge and plunge in to tell the truth master meadow mouse always felt safer when one of the muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time
for the muskrats all had a warning signal that told everybody when there was danger when one of them caught sight of peter mink he never failed if he was in the water to give a loud slap upon the surface with his tail
master meadow mouse always had one ear that was listening for that slap and when it sounded he never waited an instant but darted into his tunnel without even stopping to shake the water off his coat
he said that he could dry his coat after he reached home while if he stopped to dry it at the edge of the brook perhaps hed never get home at all you might think that now and then he would have said to himself
oh i wont bother to look for peter mink to day he must be miles away ill step right out of my tunnel and have my swim without taking a look see first but master meadow mouse was never so lazy as that
and the day came at last when it was well worth his while to take the little extra trouble of peeping out before he had his swim for master meadow mouse caught a glimpse of a snakelike head that darted out from under the bank of the brook and darted back again out of sight
and his tongue gave my hand a lick he pressed close to me as if he were fain to crowd himself into my hand he loved it with his tail with his paw with his tongue if he could speak i believe he would say with me
that paradise is attained by touch for in touch is all love and intelligence this small incident started me on a chat about hands and if my chat is fortunate i have to thank my dog star
in any case it is pleasant to have something to talk about that no one else has monopolized it is like making a new path in the trackless woods blazing the trail where no foot has pressed before
i am glad to take you by the hand and lead you along an untrodden way into a world where the hand is supreme but at the very outset we encounter a difficulty you are so accustomed to light
i promise that you shall not be led into fire or water or fall into a deep pit if you will follow me patiently you will find that theres a sound so fine nothing lives twixt it and silence
and that there is more meant in things than meets the eye my hand is to me what your hearing and sight together are to you in large measure we travel the same highways read the same books speak the same language
a slight flutter of the fingers began the intelligence the joy the fullness of my life like job i feel as if a hand had made me fashioned me together round about and moulded my very soul
in all my experiences and thoughts i am conscious of a hand whatever moves me whatever thrills me is as a hand that touches me in the dark and that touch is my reality you might as well say that a sight which makes you glad
all these and a thousand resultant combinations which take shape in my mind constitute my world ideas make the world we live in and impressions furnish ideas my world is built of touch sensations
but without colour and sound it breathes and throbs with life
of beauty or of incongruity for with my hands i can feel the comic as well as the beautiful in the outward appearance of things remember that you dependent on your sight do not realize how many things are tangible
all palpable things are mobile or rigid solid or liquid big or small warm or cold and these qualities are variously modified
the coolness of a water lily rounding into bloom is different from the coolness of an evening wind in summer and different again from the coolness of the rain that soaks into the hearts of growing things and gives them life and body
the velvet of the rose is not that of a ripe peach or of a babys dimpled cheek the hardness of the rock is to the hardness of wood what a mans deep bass is to a womans voice when it is low
what i call beauty i find in certain combinations of all these qualities and is largely derived from the flow of curved and straight lines which is over all things what does the straight line mean to you
it means several things it symbolizes duty it seems to have the quality of inexorableness that duty has when i have something to do that must not be set aside i feel as if i were going forward in a straight line
or go on forever without swerving to the right or to the left that is what it means to escape this moralizing you should ask how does the straight line feel it feels as i suppose it looks straight
now broken off or lengthened or swelling they rise and sink beneath my fingers they are full of sudden starts and pauses and their variety is inexhaustible and wonderful so you see i am not shut out from the region of the beautiful
though my hand cannot perceive the brilliant colours in the sunset or on the mountain or reach into the blue depths of the sky physics tells me that i am well off in a world which i am told knows neither cold nor sound
for at least every object appears to my fingers standing solidly right side up and is not an inverted image on the retina which i understand your brain is at infinite though unconscious labour to set back on its feet
a tangible object passes complete into my brain with the warmth of life upon it and occupies the same place that it does in space for without egotism the mind is as large as the universe
when i think of hills i think of the upward strength i tread upon when water is the object of my thought i feel the cool shock of the plunge and the quick yielding of the waves that crisp and curl and ripple about my body
the pleasing changes of rough and smooth pliant and rigid curved and straight in the bark and branches of a tree give the truth to my hand the immovable rock with its juts and warped surface
a bird in my hand was then worth two in the barnyard my fingers cannot of course get the impression of a large whole at a glance but i feel the parts and my mind puts them together
i move around my house touching object after object in order before i can form an idea of the entire house in other peoples houses i can touch only what is shown to me the chief objects of interest
carvings on the wall or a curious architectural feature exhibited like the family album therefore a house with which i am not familiar has for me at first no general effect or harmony of detail
it is not a complete conception but a collection of object impressions which as they come to me are disconnected and isolated but my mind is full of associations sensations
theories and with them it constructs the house the process reminds me of the building of solomons temple
the silent worker is imagination which decrees reality out of chaos without imagination what a poor thing my world would be
my garden would be a silent patch of earth strewn with sticks of a variety of shapes and smells but when the eye of my mind is opened to its beauty the bare ground brightens beneath my feet and the hedge row bursts into leaf
and the rose tree shakes its fragrance everywhere i know how budding trees look and i enter into the amorous joy of the mating birds and this is the miracle of imagination
which he has embodied in a sculptured form although compared with the life warm mobile face of a friend the marble is cold and pulseless and unresponsive yet it is beautiful to my hand
its flowing curves and bendings are a real pleasure only breath is wanting but under the spell of the imagination the marble thrills and becomes the divine reality of the ideal imagination puts a sentiment into every line and curve
and the statue in my touch is indeed the goddess herself who breathes and moves and enchants it is true however that some sculptures even recognized masterpieces do not please my hand
when i touch what there is of the winged victory it reminds me at first of a headless limbless dream that flies towards me in an unrestful sleep
the garments of the victory thrust stiffly out behind and do not resemble garments that i have felt flying fluttering folding spreading in the wind
but imagination fulfils these imperfections and straightway the victory becomes a powerful and spirited figure with the sweep of sea winds in her robes and the splendour of conquest in her wings
and i like the luxuriant wavy hair of bacchus and apollo and the wreath of ivy so suggestive of pagan holidays so imagination crowns the experience of my hands
and they learned their cunning from the wise hand of another which itself guided by imagination led me safely in paths that i knew not
chapter twelve the first day mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog
and where the slopes pitched sharply down it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot certainly the choice of nash was well made an eastern horse of blood over a level course
but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail dawn came while they wound over the crest of the range and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade it was well into the morning before nash reached logan
i spose youre here askin after bard
bard whos he logan considered the other with a sardonic smile
youll wear out the snapper on it im on my way to the a circle y listen im all for old man drew you know that tell me what bard has on him never heard the name before did he rustle a couple of your sheep
dyou think im on somebodys trail dont you know ive been through with that sort of game for a hell of a while when rocks turn into ham and eggs ill trust you steve ill tell you what i done to bard anyway yesterday
then he hinted around about learnin the way to eldara because he knows that town is pretty close to drews place i guess i told him sure i did he should of gone due west but i sent him south there is a south trail
only it takes about three days to get to eldara maybe you think that interests me it dont logan overlooked this rejoinder saying is it his scalp youre after your ideas are like nest eggs logan
an you set over em like a hen they look like eggs they feel like eggs but they dont never hatch thats the way with your ideas they look all right they sound all right but they dont mean nothin so long
what you say cuts both ways steve this feller bard
he sounds like a tenderfoot but he aint a tenderfoot feeling that this parting shot gave him the honours of the meeting he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs overhearing stood still and gazed at his master
his eastern course nash pursued for a mile or more
he was weary like his horse and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed he let the pony go on at the same tireless jog clinging like a bulldog to the trail about midday
hello young feller lo stranger whats the chance of bunking here for three or four hours and gettin a good feed for the hoss never better gimme the hoss
feed him grain no you wont put him up ill tend to that looks like a bad un thats it
unsaddled him and gave him a small feed the horse first rolled on the dirt floor and then started methodically on his fodder having made sure that his mount was not off his feed nash rolled a cigarette and strolled back to the house with the boy
wheres the folks he asked mas sick a little and didnt get up to day pas down to the corral cussing mad but i can cook you up some chow all right son i got a dollar here thatll buy you a pretty good store knife
the boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw coloured hair seemed positively white maybe you want to pay me he suggested fiercely maybe you think were squatters that run a hotel
recognizing the true western breed even in this small edition nash grinned speakin man to man son i didnt think that but i thought id sort of feel my way which ill say youre lucky you didnt try to feel your way with pa
and set about frying ham and making coffee this with crackers formed the meal he watched nash eat for a moment of solemn silence and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster let me in on the joke son nothin
i was just thinkin of pa whats he sore about come out short at poker lately no he lost a hoss ha ha ha he explained
nash sipped his coffee and waited on the mountain desert one does not draw out a narrator with questions
he was a sure enough tenderfoot leastways he looked it an he talked it but he wasnt the familiarity of this description made steve sit up a trifle straighter was he a ringer maybe i dunno
pa meets him at the door and asks him in
the boy paused to remember and then with twinkling eyes he mimicked thats very good of you sir but ill only stop to make a trade with you this horse and some cash to boot for a durable mount out of your corral
the brute has gone lame you see
an i wont ask much cash to boot i begin wonderin what pa was drivin at but i didnt say nothin jest held myself together and waited look over there to the corral says pa and pointed
its the best hoss ive ever had it was the best horse pa ever had too it was a piebald pinto called jo after my cousin josiah whos jest a plain bad un and raises hell when theres any excuse the piebald
he didnt even need an excuse you see
when he leaves the corral he likes to have another hoss for a runnin mate and he was jest as tame as anything i could ride him anybody could ride him but if you took him outside the bars of the corral without company first thing he done
when he seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself
which jo can raise more hell for his size than any hoss i ever seen hes what you call an eddicated bucker he dont fool around with no pauses he jest starts in and figgers out a situation
an he always used to win out in fact he was known for it all around these parts he begun nice and easy
and the end was the rider lyin on the ground whenever the boys around here wanted any excitement they used to come over and try their hands with jo
and tame down the bruises after jo laid em cold on the ground
well this tenderfoot he looks over the hoss in the corral and says
aw twenty five dollars is enough says pa all right says the tenderfoot heres the money and he counts it out in pas hand he says what a little beauty it would be a treat to see him work on a polo field pa says
then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin offn my face down goes the tenderfoot and takes his saddle and flops it on the piebald pinto and the piebald was jest as nice as milk then he leads him outn the corral and gets on
but he didnt see none then the circus started an blieve me it was some circus jo hadnt had much action for some time
thinkin up new ways of raisin hell
which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle he was an he never pulled leather no sir he never touched the buckin strap but jest sat there with his teeth set
and his lips twistin back the same smile he had when he got into the saddle but pretty soon i spose jo had a chance to figure out that it didnt do him no particular harm to be alone the minute he seen that he stopped fightin
and started off at a gallop the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go which was over there damn my eyes says pa
there wouldnt be no drawin card to get the boys around the house no more but youre lookin sort of sleepy stranger i am answered nash well if youd seen that show you wouldnt be thinkin of sleep not for some time maybe not
but the point is i didnt see it dyou mind if i turn in on that bunk over there help yourself said the boy what time dyou want me to wake you up never mind i wake up automatic slong bud
chapter eight two apparitions
found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house from the back it looked down on the lights glimmering on the black east river and across to the flare of brooklyn to the left the whole arc of the fifty ninth street bridge was exposed
here they took up the vigil
bill gregg shook his head thats not the one shes all different a pile different ronicky ronicky sighed
go on back to sleep ill call you again if anything happens
ghost hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil
apparently the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality not a sign of caroline smith appeared even during the second day
by this time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them its proof that she aint yonder said bill gregg
and he grew pale at the thought partner said ronicky doone if they are trying to keep her away from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days aint that right
its just about our last chance bill weve done our hunting pretty near as well as we could if we dont land her this trip im about ready to give up
one week was decided on as a fair test if at the end of that time caroline smith did not come out of the house across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there
peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which sheltered him from being observed at his spying when he called out softly the sound brought gregg with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window there could be no shadow of a doubt about it
there stood caroline smith in the door of the house she closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps paused there and looked up and down the street bill gregg groaned
snatched his hat and plunged through the door and ronicky heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of stairs then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing
and so swift was that descent that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came onto the sidewalk bill gregg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her
for never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt never had his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless while his soft gray hat to which he still clung religiously appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast with the slim prettiness of the girl
she wore a black straw hat turned back from her face with a single big red flower at the side of it
the same distinction between their clothes was in their faces the finely modeled prettiness of her features and the big careless chiseling of the features of bill gregg ronicky doone did not wonder that after her first fear her gesture was one of disdain and surprise
he went a long slow step closer to her with both his hands outstretched
ronicky doone followed that glance and he saw all hidden save the profile of the face
what a face it was never in his life had ronicky doone seen a man who in one instant filled him with such fear and hatred such loathing and such dread such scorn and such terror
the nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey the eyes were long and slanting like those of an oriental the face was thin almost fleshless so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a deaths head
the girl hesitated a moment
for she made a slight outward gesture with one hand if this were in her mind however it vanished instantly she turned with a shudder and hurried away down the street
as for bill gregg he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back across the pavement but it was the erectness of a soldier who has met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed
what a contrast between the ascent and the descent he had literally flown down now his heels clumped out a slow and regular death march as he came back to the room when gregg opened the door
ronicky doone blinked and drew in a deep breath at the sight of the poor fellows face gregg had known before that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen
now in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood he had lost her and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair
after that he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply his legs were twisted awkwardly sprawling across the floor in front of him one long arm dragged down toward the floor
as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor hardened hands his chin was fallen against his breast when ronicky doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up its ended
said bill gregg faintly now we hit the back trail and forget all about this he added with a faint attempt at cynicism ive just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine thats all
said ronicky doone bill look me in the eye and tell me man to man that youre a liar he added can you ever be happy without her man the cruelty of that speech made gregg flush
said gregg huskily aint there thats where you and me dont agree
look at the way things have gone you start out with a photograph of a girl now youve followed her found her name
aint that something done after youve done all that
not you bill youre going to buck up and go ahead full steam
bill gregg smiled sourly
dyou know what she said well bill gregg she says i dont remember any such name that took the wind out of me i only had enough left to say
the gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you from the west the one you sent your picture to and sent my picture to she says and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet youre mad she says
and then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house dyou know why she looked back over her shoulder just for the reason i told you no bill there was a gent standing up there at a window watching her and how she acted
hes the one whos kept her in that house
that sent out the girl with exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you seen her bill what that girl told you didnt come out of her own head it come out of the head of the gent across the way when you turned your back on her
she looked like shed run after you and try to explain but the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her and she didnt dare bill
you got to get that gent i seen grinning from the window grinning asked bill gregg grinding his teeth and starting from his chair was the skunk laughing at me sure every minute bill gregg groaned ill smash every bone in his ugly head
shake said ronicky doone thats the sort of talk i wanted to hear
chapter twelve the strange bargain ronicky drew his gun and waited good said the man of the sneer go ahead it was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks
that dropped him into the coal bin did he get coal dust on his shoes right and he didnt have sense enough to wipe it off an amateur a rank amateur i told you said the man of the sneer with satisfaction
you followed his trail up the stairs to the kitchen and down the hall and up to harrys room we already knew hed gone there but he left that room again and came down the hall yes
and where did it lead right to this room ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks
the time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape and he was ready to shoot to kill a moment of pause had come a pause which in the imagination of ronicky
thats a likely story i can show you the tracks
you fool they simply grew dim when they got to this door ive been here for some time go back and tell them to hunt some more go up to the attic and search there thats the place an amateur would most likely hide
the man growled some retort and left closing the door heavily behind him while ronicky doone breathed freely again for the first time now said the man of the sneer tell me the whole of it ruth ronicky set his teeth
had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily had he sent his follower away merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved go on the leader was repeating let me hear the whole truth
i i stammered the girl and she could say no more the man of the sneer laughed unpleasantly let me help you it was somebody you met somewhere
you smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here the only way he could get in was by stealth is that right
so he came in exactly that way like a robber but really only to keep a tryst with his lady love a pretty story a true romance
my dear girl john began ruth tolliver her voice shaking tush he broke in as smoothly as ever let me tell the story for you and spare your blushes
although you were glad to see him you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire fire being me do i gather the drift of the story fairly well finally you have him worked up to the right pitch
you show him that it is possible
yes said the girl unevenly that is ah murmured the man of the sneer you seem rather relieved that i have guessed he left the house in that case ronicky doone had held the latch of the door turned back for some time
now he pushed it open and stepped out he was only barely in time for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction since there was only one hiding place in the room
he was brought up with a shock by the sight of ronickys big colt held at the hip and covering him with absolute certainty ruth tolliver did not cry out but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract
as if she were preparing herself for the explosion you dont have to put up your hands said ronicky doone wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer he had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance
he knew every line in that sharp profile thank you
i congratulate you on your good taste a regular apollo my dear ruth he turned back to ronicky doone and i suppose you have overhead our entire conversation the whole lot of it said ronicky
though i wasnt playing my hand at eavesdropping i couldnt help hearing you partner the man of the sneer looked him over leisurely western he said at last decidedly western are you staying long in the east my friend
i dunno said ronicky doone smiling faintly at the coolness of the other what do you think about it meaning that im liable to put an end to your stay maybe tush tush
i suppose ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow i am but i dont use poison and i dont kill with mysterious x rays i am as you see a very quiet and ordinary sort
ronicky doone smiled again you just oblige me partner he replied in his own soft voice just stay away from the walls of the room dont even sit down stand right where you are
youd murder me if i took another step asked the man of the sneer and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time id sure blow you full of lead said ronicky fervently
id kill you like a snake stranger which i mostly think you are so step light and step quick when i talk certainly said the other bowing i am entirely at your service he turned a little to ruth
i see that you have a most determined cavalier i suppose hell instantly abduct you and sweep you away from beneath my eyes she made a vague gesture of denial go ahead said the leader by the way
my name is john mark im doone some call me ronicky doone im glad to know you ronicky doone i imagine that name fits you now tell me the story of why you came to this house of course it wasnt to see a girl
youre wrong it was ah in spite of himself the face of john mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage i came to see a girl and her name i figure is caroline smith
relief wonder and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of john mark caroline you came for that suddenly he laughed heartily but there was a tremor of emotion in that laughter
the perfect torture which had been wringing the soul of the man of the sneer projected through the laughter i ask your pardon my dear said john mark to ruth i should have guessed you found him he confessed why he was here you took pity on him
and he brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool very well then it seems ive made an ass of myself but ill try to make up for it now what about caroline
leave this house and take a ride or a walk with me as much as that if you have to talk to her why not do the talking here i dunno replied ronicky doone i figure shed think too much about you all the time
yes i have a curious stock of useless information well youre right im going to try to get her back for bill but you cant expect me to assent to that i sure do and why
this caroline smith may be a person of great value to me i have no doubt she is but i got a good argument
the gun partner and if you couldnt get the girl but see how absurd the whole thing is ronicky doone i send for the girl i request her to go down with you to the street and take a walk because you wish to talk to her
heavens man i cant persuade her to go with a stranger at night surely you see that ill do that persuading said ronicky doone calmly and when youre on the streets with the girl
do you suppose ill rest idle and let you walk away with her once were outside of the house mark said ronicky doone i dont ask no favors let your men come on
i aint terrible backward with the trigger finger john mark not that i figure on bragging but i want you to pick good men for my trail and tell em to step soft is that square
suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain said ronicky you send for caroline smith im to do the persuading to get her out of the house were safe to the doors of the house the minute we step into the street
youre free to do anything you want to get either of us will you shake on that for a moment the leader hesitated then his fingers closed over the extended hand of ronicky doone and clamped down on them like so many steel wires contracting
at the same time a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of john mark ronicky doone taken utterly by surprise was at a great disadvantage
a great rage came in the eyes of john mark a great wonder came in the eyes of the westerner where did john mark get his sudden strength well said ronicky weve shaken hands and now you can do what you please
sit down leave the room anything
that brought a start from john mark and a flash of eagerness but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl weve shaken hands he admitted slowly as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act
one of them said to the others if we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows how shall we set about it the other said do you see that large cornfield there
if we were to hide ourselves in that no one could find us the army cannot come into it and to morrow it is to march on they crept into the corn but the army did not march on but remained encamped close around them
they sat for two days and two nights in the corn and grew so hungry that they nearly died but if they were to venture out it was certain death they said at last
what use was it our deserting we must perish here miserably whilst they were speaking a fiery dragon came flying through the air
said they then the dragon seized them in his claws took them through the air over the army and set them down on the earth a long way from it he gave them a little whip saying
then he put a book before them which he made all three of them sign i will then give you a riddle he said if you guess it you shall be free and out of my power the dragon then flew away
and they journeyed on with their little whip they had as much money as they wanted wore grand clothes and made their way into the world wherever they went they lived in merrymaking and splendour drove about with horses and carriages ate and drank but did nothing wrong
they went into a field sat down and the two pulled long faces an old woman passed by and asked them why they were so sad
only confide your trouble in me
and how he had given them money as plentifully as blackberries but as they had signed their names they were his unless when the seven years had passed they could guess a riddle the old woman said
if you would help yourselves one of you must go into the wood and there he will come upon a tumble down building of rocks which looks like a little house he must go in and there he will find help the two melancholy ones thought
that wont save us and they remained where they were but the third and merry one jumped up and went into the wood till he found the rock hut in the hut sat a very old woman who was the dragons grandmother
she asked him how he came and what was his business there he told her all that happened and because she was pleased with him she took compassion on him
i will tell you this in the north sea lies a dead sea cat that shall be their roast meat and the rib of a whale that shall be their silver spoon and the hollow foot of a dead horse that shall be their wineglass
i know enough and can help myself splendidly then he went by another way through the window secretly and in all haste back to his comrades he told them how the dragon had been outwitted by his grandmother
and how he had heard from his own lips the answer to the riddle then they were all delighted and in high spirits took out their whip and cracked so much money that it came jumping up from the ground when the seven years had quite gone the fiend came with his book and
pointing at the signatures said i will take you underground with me you shall have a meal there if you can tell me what you will get for your roast meat you shall be free
then said the first soldier
the dragon made a face and growled again three times hum
do you know what your wineglass shall be an old horses hoof shall be our wineglass
once there lived a king who had no children for many years after his marriage at length heaven granted him a daughter of such remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate for her as fairer than a fairy
than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it and either to torment her cruelly or at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men the eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge this fairy was named lagree
she was so old that she only had one eye and one tooth left
she was also so spiteful that she gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or ill natured tricks of the whole body of fairies with her large experience added to her native spite
she felt a little reassured and was further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had followed her
at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out the fire which was burning brightly in the grate she then gave two glass bottles into the princesss charge desiring her to take the greatest care of them
and having enforced her orders with the most awful threats in case of disobedience she vanished leaving the little girl at liberty to explore the palace
several years passed during which time the princess grew accustomed to her lonely life obeyed the fairys orders and by degrees forgot all about the court of the king her father
she noticed that the suns rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce a brilliant rainbow she stood still to admire it when to her great surprise she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come from the centre of its rays
the voice was that of a young man and its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered led one to infer that its owner must be equally charming but this had to be a mere matter of fancy for no one was visible
the beautiful rainbow informed fairer than a fairy that he was young the son of a powerful king and that the fairy lagree who owed his parents a grudge
had revenged herself by depriving him of his natural shape for some years that she had imprisoned him in the palace where he had found his confinement hard to bear for some time but now he owned
he no longer sighed for freedom since he had seen and learned to love fairer than a fairy he added many other tender speeches to this declaration and the princess to whom such remarks were a new experience
could not help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions the prince could only appear or speak under the form of a rainbow and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves
lagree on her return soon found out the neglect and seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her spite to her lovely prisoner
for fire with which to relight the one she had allowed to go out now this locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he came across and especially enjoyed a chance of catching
and eating any young girls our heroine obeyed with great sweetness and without having been able to take leave of her lover
as to certain death as she was crossing a wood a bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find in a fountain close by and to use it when needed
she took the birds advice and in due time arrived at the house of locrinos luckily she only found his wife at home who was much struck by the princesss youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners
she readily let fairer than a fairy have the fire
convenient way of meeting than by the garden fountain and fairer than a fairy carried out his plan daily with entire success every morning she placed a large basin full of water on her window sill and as soon as the suns rays fell on the water
the rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the fountain by this means they were able to meet without losing sight of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old fairy kept her eye and her tooth at night
and for some time the lovers enjoyed every hour of sunshine together one day prince rainbow appeared in the depths of woe he had just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot but he had no idea where he was to go
the poor young couple were in despair and only parted with the last ray of sunshine and in hopes of meeting next morning alas next day was dark and gloomy and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the clouds for a few minutes
fairer than a fairy eagerly ran to the window but in her haste she upset the basin and spilt all the water with which she had carefully filled it overnight no other water was at hand except that in the two bottles
it was the only chance of seeing her lover before they were separated and she did not hesitate to break the bottle and pour their contents into the basin when the rainbow appeared at once their farewells were full of tenderness
the prince made the most ardent and sincere protestations and promised to neglect nothing which might help to deliver his dear fairer than a fairy from her captivity and implored her to consent to their marriage as soon as they should both be free
the princess on her side vowed to have no other husband and declared herself willing to brave death itself in order to rejoin him they were not allowed much time for their adieus the rainbow vanished and the princess resolved to run all risks
started off at once taking nothing with her but her dog her cat a sprig of myrtle and the stone which the wife of locrinos gave her when lagree became aware of her prisoners flight
as she did so the sprig of myrtle she carried touched the ground and immediately a green and shady bower sprang up round her in which she hoped to sleep in peace but lagree had not given up her pursuit
and arrived just as fairer than a fairy had fallen fast asleep this time she made sure of catching her victim but the cat spied her out
she flew at lagrees face and tore out her only eye thus delivering the princess for ever from her persecutor
but no sooner had lagree been put to fight than our heroine was overwhelmed with hunger and thirst she felt as though she should certainly expire and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as far
which stood at no great distance here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in green and white to match the house which apparently belonged to her and of which she seemed the only inhabitant
she gave her a nut desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need after a long and tiring journey fairer than a fairy was once more received in a house and by a lady exactly like the one she
here again she received a present with the same injunctions
that they wished their houses and garments to be equally alike their occupation consisted in helping those in misfortune and they were as gentle and benevolent as lagree had been cruel and spiteful the third fairy comforted the poor traveller
begged her not to lose heart and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded she accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smelling bottle with strict orders only to open it in case of urgent need
fairer than a fairy thanked her warmly and resumed her way cheered by pleasant thoughts after a time her road led through a wood full of soft airs and sweet odours and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a wonderful silver castle
fairer than a fairy felt a strong desire to enter this castle but besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be neither doors nor windows she had no doubt though really i cannot think why
that the moment had come in which to use the nut which had been given her she opened it and out came a diminutive hall porter
you ever saw the princess climbed up one of the silver chains holding in her hand the little porter who in spite of his minute size opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in
she entered a magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire castle and which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling
who now saw him for the first time in his real shape
on opening it found that all the seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof and at once began playing melodiously
the prince was not completely roused but he opened his eyes a little and looked all the handsomer impatient at not being recognised fairer than a fairy now drew out her third present and on opening the crystal scent bottle a little syren flew out
at the same moment the walls of the room expanded and opened out revealing a golden throne covered with jewels
in the first and most splendid of these carriages sat prince rainbows mother she fondly embraced her son after which she informed him that his father had been dead for some years that the anger of the fairies was at length appeased
and that he might return in peace to reign over his people who were longing for his presence the court received the new king with joyful acclamations which would have delighted him at any other time
he was just about to present her to his mother and the court
charms would win all hearts when the three green and white sisters appeared they declared the secret of fairy than a fairys royal birth and the queen taking the two lovers in her carriage set off with them for the capital of the kingdom
far away in north america where the red indians dwell
many of the young braves sought her in marriage but she would listen to one only a handsome chief who had taken her fancy some years before so they were to be married and great rejoicings were made
but from sunrise to sunset he sat by the place where she was laid thinking of his happiness that was buried there at last after many days a light seemed to come to him out of the darkness
he remembered having heard from the old old people of the tribe that there was a path that led to the land of souls that if you sought carefully you could find it
so the next morning he got up early and put some food in his pouch and slung an extra skin over his shoulders for he knew not how long his journey would take nor what sort of country he would have to go through only one thing he knew
one of the old men say that the land of souls lay to the south and so filled with new hope and courage he set his face southwards for many many miles the country looked the same as it did round his own home
but grew less and less the farther he went south till it disappeared altogether soon the trees put forth their buds and flowers sprang up under his feet and instead of thick clouds there was blue sky over his head and everywhere the birds were singing
and on the top of these he found a hut or wigwam an old man clothed in skins and holding a staff in his hand stood in the doorway
rest in my hut as she also rested and i will tell you what you ask and whither you should go on hearing these words the young man entered the hut but his heart was too eager within him
to suffer him to rest and when he arose the old man rose too and stood with him at the door look he said
at the water which lies far out yonder and the plains which stretch beyond
but no man enters it without leaving his body behind him
instead of hiding as he approached and birds circled round him
very soon he noticed with wonder that neither rocks nor trees barred his path he passed through them without knowing it for indeed they were not rocks and trees at all but only the souls of them for this was the land of shadows
when to his joy and wonder he saw following him in another canoe exactly like his own the maiden for whose sake he had made this long journey but they could not touch each other for between them rolled great waves which looked as if they would sink the boats
only the children had no fear and reached the other side in safety still though the chief and the young girl quailed in terror at these horrible sights and sounds no harm came to them for their lives had been free from evil
so they reached unhurt the shore of the happy island and wandered through the flowery fields and by the banks of rushing streams and they knew not hunger nor thirst neither cold nor heat
but in the murmur of the wind he heard the master of life saying to him return whither you came for i have work for you to do and your people need you and for many years you shall rule over them
at the gate my messenger awaits you and you shall take again
to his astonishment he found an old woman who begged him to help her out of the ditch the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there my son
answered the old woman i am a very poor woman and soon after midnight i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning but i lost my way in the dark
over there at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance replied the old woman the prince lifted her on to his horse and soon they reached the hut where the old woman got down and turning to the prince said
just wait a moment and i will give you something and she disappeared into her hut but returned very soon and said you are a mighty prince but at the same
which deserves to be rewarded would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife most certainly i would replied the prince so the old woman continued
who has been captured by a dragon if you wish to marry her you must first set her free and this i will help you to do i will give you this little bell if you ring it once
the king of the eagles will appear if you ring it twice the king of the foxes will come to you and if you ring it three times you will see the king of the fishes by your side
and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid so the next morning the prince mounted his fine horse and left his home
and his horse had died of exhaustion while he himself had suffered much from want and misery but still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of at last one day he came to a hut in front of which sat a very old man
no i do not answered the old man
the prince thanked him for his information and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road and at the end of it came to the little hut where he found a very old man
he asked him the same question and the old man answered no
with diamond windows he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard
when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted the prince replied
would like to enter her service this flattering speech pleased the dragons and the eldest of them said well you may come with me and i will take you to the mother dragon
they entered the castle and walked through twelve splendid halls all made of gold and diamonds in the twelfth room they found the mother dragon seated on a diamond throne she was the
and added to it all she had three heads her appearance was a great shock to the prince and so was her voice which was like the croaking of many ravens she asked him
very well
we will eat you up the prince undertook the task and led the mare out to the meadow
and at last in despair sat down on a big stone and contemplated his sad fate as he sat thus lost in thought he noticed an eagle flying over his head then he suddenly bethought him of his little bell
and taking it out of his pocket he rang it once in a moment he heard a rustling sound in the air beside him and the king of the eagles sank at his feet
the bird said you are looking for the mother dragons mare who is galloping about among the clouds i will summon all the eagles of the air together and order them to catch the mare and bring her to you and with these words the king of the eagles flew away
towards evening the prince heard a mighty rushing sound in the air and when he looked up he saw thousands of eagles driving the mare before them they sank at his feet on to the ground and gave the mare over to him then the prince rode home to the old mother dragon
who was full of wonder when she saw him and said
she gave him at the same time a cloak made of copper
here too was the flower queens beautiful daughter her dress was woven out of the most lovely flowers in the world and her complexion was like lilies and roses as the prince was dancing with her he managed to whisper in her ear
the ball came to an end at midnight and early next morning the prince again led the mother dragons mare out into the meadow but again she vanished before his eyes then he took out his little bell and rang it twice
and again she led him to the ball room the flower queens daughter was delighted to see him safe and sound and when they were dancing together she whispered in his ear if you succeed again to morrow wait for me with the foal in the meadow
after the ball we will fly away together on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again but once more she vanished before his eyes then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times
in a moment the king of the fishes appeared and said to him i know quite well what you want me to do and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together
she said to him you are a brave youth and i will make you my body servant but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with
the prince begged for a foal of the mare which the mother dragon at once gave him and over and above a cloak made of gold for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty so in the evening he appeared at the ball in his golden cloak
the prince and she flew like the wind till they reached the flower queens dwelling but the dragons had noticed their flight and woke their brother out of his years sleep he flew into a terrible rage when he heard what had happened
and determined to lay siege to the flower queens palace but the queen caused a forest of flowers as high as the sky to grow up round her dwelling through which no one could force a way
when the flower queen heard that her daughter wanted to marry the prince she said to him i will give my consent to your marriage gladly but my daughter can only stay with you in summer in winter when everything is dead and the ground covered with snow
she must come and live with me in my palace underground the prince consented to this and led his beautiful bride home where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence the young couple lived happily together till winter came
when the flower queens daughter departed and went home to her mother
and lasted till the approach of winter when the flower queens daughter went back again to her mother
northanger abbey
this little work was finished in the year eighteen o three and intended for immediate publication it was disposed of to a bookseller it was even advertised
neither the author nor the public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete
the public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed since it was finished many more since it was begun and that during that period places manners books and opinions have undergone considerable changes
chapter one no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine her situation in life
the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her her father was a clergyman without being neglected or poor and a very respectable man
her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution she had three sons before catherine was born
where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number but the morlands had little other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any
she had a thin awkward figure
dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind she was fond of all boys plays and greatly preferred cricket
not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary bird or watering a rose bush indeed she had no taste for a garden
and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take such were her propensities
her abilities were quite as extraordinary she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid
her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the beggars petition and after all her next sister sally could say it better than she did not that catherine was always stupid by no means
she learnt the fable of the hare and many friends as quickly as any girl in england her mother wished her to learn music and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet
so at eight years old she began she learnt a year and could not bear it and missus morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off
french by her mother her proficiency in either was not remarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could what a strange unaccountable character for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old
hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house such was catherine morland at ten at fifteen appearances were mending
she began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improved her features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and her figure more consequence
her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement
catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty today were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds to look almost pretty
than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive missus morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occupied in lying in and teaching the little ones
that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback
and running about the country at the age of fourteen to books or at least books of information for provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them provided they were all story and no reflection
she had never any objection to books at all but from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable
many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air from thompson that it is a delightful task to teach the young idea how to shoot
and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ
that the poor beetle which we tread upon in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great as when a giant dies and that a young woman in love always looks
like patience on a monument smiling at grief so far her improvement was sufficient and in many other points she came on exceedingly well for though she could not write sonnets
she brought herself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her own composition she could listen to other peoples performance with very little fatigue
her greatest deficiency was in the pencil she had no notion of drawing not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lovers profile that she might be detected in the design
there she fell miserably short of the true heroic height at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to portray she had reached the age of seventeen
without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient
this was strange indeed but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out there was not one lord in the neighbourhood no not even a baronet
there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door not one young man whose origin was unknown her father had no ward and the squire of the parish no children
but when a young lady is to be a heroine the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way mister allen
who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if
she must seek them abroad invited her to go with them
chapter thirty catherines disposition was not naturally sedentary nor had her habits been ever very industrious but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort
her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased she could neither sit still nor employ herself for ten minutes together walking round the garden and orchard again and again as if nothing but motion was voluntary
and it seemed as if she could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration in her rambling and her idleness
but when a third nights rest had neither restored her cheerfulness improved her in useful activity nor given her a greater inclination for needlework she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of
my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richards cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath
catherine took up her work directly saying in a dejected voice that her head did not run upon bath much then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you
for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles after a short silence i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger
that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast
to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject
about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good catherine said no more and with an endeavour to do right
applied to her work but after a few minutes sunk again without knowing it herself into languor and listlessness moving herself in her chair from the irritation of weariness much oftener than she moved her needle
hastily left the room to fetch the book in question anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady it was some time before she could find what she looked for and other family matters occurring to detain her
a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped her avocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself
she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes till on entering the room the first object she beheld was a young man whom she had never seen before
with a look of much respect he immediately rose and being introduced to her by her conscious daughter as mister henry tilney with the embarrassment of real sensibility
began to apologize for his appearance there acknowledging that after what had passed he had little right to expect a welcome at fullerton and stating his impatience to be assured of miss morlands having reached her home in safety
as the cause of his intrusion he did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart far from comprehending him or his sister in their fathers misconduct
missus morland had been always kindly disposed towards each and instantly pleased by his appearance received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence thanking him for such an attention to her daughter
though his heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked for mildness it was not just at that moment in his power to say anything to the purpose returning in silence to his seat therefore
but her glowing cheek and brightened eye made her mother trust that this good natured visit would at least set her heart at ease for a time and gladly therefore did she lay aside the first volume of the mirror for a future hour
desirous of mister morlands assistance as well in giving encouragement as in finding conversation for her guest whose embarrassment on his fathers account she earnestly pitied
missus morland had very early dispatched one of the children to summon him but mister morland was from home and being thus without any support at the end of a quarter of an hour she had nothing to say
after a couple of minutes unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for the first time since her mothers entrance asked her with sudden alacrity if mister and missus allen were now at fullerton
and on developing from amidst all her perplexity of words in reply the meaning which one short syllable would have given immediately expressed his intention of paying his respects to them and
asked her if she would have the goodness to show him the way you may see the house from this window sir was information on sarahs side which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman and a silencing nod from her mother
for missus morland thinking it probable as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours that he might have some explanation to give of his fathers behaviour
which it must be more pleasant for him to communicate only to catherine would not on any account prevent her accompanying him they began their walk and missus morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it
some explanation on his fathers account he had to give but his first purpose was to explain himself and before they reached mister allens grounds he had done it so well that catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too often
and delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her society i must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than gratitude or in other words that a persuasion of her partiality for him
had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought it is a new circumstance in romance i acknowledge and dreadfully derogatory of an heroines dignity but if it be as new in common life
the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own a very short visit to missus allen in which henry talked at random without sense or connection and catherine
scarcely opened her lips dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tete a tete and before it was suffered to close she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application
on his return from woodston two days before he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father hastily informed in angry terms of miss morlands departure and ordered to think of her no more
such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand the affrighted catherine amidst all the terrors of expectation as she listened to this account
could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientious rejection by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject
nothing to lay to her charge but her being the involuntary unconscious object of a deception which his pride could not pardon and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own
and designed her for his daughter in law on discovering his error to turn her from the house seemed the best though to his feelings an inadequate proof of his resentment towards herself and his contempt of her family
john thorpe had first misled him the general perceiving his son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to miss morland
had accidentally inquired of thorpe if he knew more of her than her name thorpe most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of general tilneys importance had been joyfully and proudly communicative
and being at that time not only in daily expectation of morlands engaging isabella but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying catherine himself
his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them with whomsoever he was or was likely to be connected
his own consequence always required that theirs should be great and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew so regularly grew their fortune the expectations of his friend morland therefore from the first overrated
had ever since his introduction to isabella been gradually increasing and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment by doubling what he chose to think the amount of mister morlands preferment trebling his private fortune
bestowing a rich aunt and sinking half the children he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light for catherine however the peculiar object of the generals curiosity
and his own speculations he had yet something more in reserve and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to mister allens estate
her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of fullerton naturally followed
upon such intelligence the general had proceeded for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority thorpes interest in the family by his sisters approaching connection with one of its members
and his own views on another circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth and to these were added the absolute facts of the allens being wealthy and childless
of miss morlands being under their care and as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge of their treating her with parental kindness his resolution was soon formed
and thankful for mister thorpes communication he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes
catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this than his own children henry and eleanor perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their fathers particular respect
had seen with astonishment the suddenness continuance and extent of his attention and though latterly from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her
henry was convinced of his fathers believing it to be an advantageous connection it was not till the late explanation at northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on
that they were false the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them from thorpe himself whom he had chanced to meet again in town and who under the influence of exactly opposite feelings
irritated by catherines refusal and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between morland and isabella convinced that they were separated forever
and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the morlands confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character
misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither
for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families with the most liberal proposals he had on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator
been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support they were in fact a necessitous family numerous too almost beyond example by no means respected in their own neighbourhood
as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections a forward bragging scheming race
the terrified general pronounced the name of allen with an inquiring look and here too thorpe had learnt his error the allens he believed had lived near them too long
and he knew the young man on whom the fullerton estate must devolve the general needed no more enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself he set out the next day for the abbey where his performances have been seen
i leave it to my readers sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for henry to communicate at this time to catherine how much of it he could have learnt from his father
in what points his own conjectures might assist him and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from james
catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned against his character or magnified his cruelty
henry in having such things to relate of his father was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself he blushed for the narrow minded counsel which he was obliged to expose
the conversation between them at northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind henrys indignation on hearing how catherine had been treated on comprehending his fathers views and being ordered to acquiesce in them
had been open and bold the general accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family prepared for no reluctance but of feeling
no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words could ill brook the opposition of his son steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it but in such a cause his anger
though it must shock could not intimidate henry who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice he felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to miss morland
and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent
he steadily refused to accompany his father into herefordshire an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of catherine and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand
the general was furious in his anger and they parted in dreadful disagreement henry in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose
chapter thirty one isabel came back to florence but only after several months an interval sufficiently replete with incident it is not however during this interval that we are closely concerned with her
our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late spring time shortly after her return to palazzo crescentini
to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude
the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth
too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle
since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always reigned she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do
grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world
a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at gardencourt a couple of years before
if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present
with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted
she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden aunt mister ludlow
the little ludlows had not yet even from the american point of view
lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows
and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped
and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made
missus ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations
missus ludlows mental motions were sufficiently various
which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another
on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities
isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likely development to lilys understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morning calls and evening parties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides
the trophies lilys conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabel to give it form and body
we know ourselves that isabel had made conquests whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land
than that she didnt wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lilys advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever
but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sisters career a strange anti climax an impression confirmed by the fact that isabels silence about mister osmond for instance
was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to missus ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune
it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews
the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the street lamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red
and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily
set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streets the moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark
she made her way down to rome without touching at florence
in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer
and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mister bantling that he would soon come over
had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless
but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt
isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites
her character had revealed itself
a consummation the more desirable
she considered with the presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it
an occasional lapse from candour in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception
and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain
advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend
but it stood for a high water mark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less
a stationary affection in other words was impossible it must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been
i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo or as she stood among the broken columns of the acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis
deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival
during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came
and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome
winter lies too long in country towns hangs on until it is stale and shabby old and sullen on the farm the weather was the great fact and mens affairs went on underneath it as the streams creep under the ice
but in black hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched frozen down to the bare stalk
through january and february i went to the river with the harlings on clear nights and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand but by march the ice was rough and choppy
at our comfortable hotel missus harling had known darnault for years
the wind from without made waves in the long carpet a coal stove glowed at either end of the room and the grand piano in the middle stood open there was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night
for missus gardener had gone to omaha for a week johnnie had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent minded it was missus gardener who ran the business and looked after everything her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travelers
he was a popular fellow but no manager missus gardener was admittedly the best dressed woman in black hawk drove the best horse and had a smart trap and a little white and gold sleigh
she seemed indifferent to her possessions was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were she was tall dark severe with something indian like in the rigid immobility of her face her manner was cold and she talked little
guests felt that they were receiving not conferring a favor when they stayed at her house even the smartest traveling men were flattered when missus gardener stopped to chat with them for a moment
two classes those who had seen missus gardeners diamonds and those who had not when i stole into the parlor anson kirkpatrick marshall fields man
he was a dapper little irishman very vain homely as a monkey with friends everywhere and a sweetheart in every port like a sailor i did not know all the men who were sitting about but i recognized a furniture salesman from kansas city
a drug man and willy oreilly who traveled for a jewelry house and sold musical instruments the talk was all about good and bad hotels actors and actresses and musical prodigies i learned that missus gardener had gone to omaha to hear booth and barrett
who were to play there next week and that mary anderson was having a great success in a winters tale in london the door from the office opened and johnnie gardener came in directing blind darnault he would never consent to be led
his yellow face was lifted in the light with a show of white teeth all grinning and his shrunken papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes good evening gentlemen no ladies here good evening gentlemen
we going to have a little music some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening it was the soft amiable negro voice like those i remembered from early childhood with the note of docile subservience in it
he had the negro head too almost no head at all nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close clipped wool
when he was sitting or standing still he swayed back and forth incessantly like a rocking toy at the piano he swayed in time to the music and when he was not playing his body kept up this motion like an empty mill grinding on
now gentlemen i expect youve all got grand voices seems like we might have some good old plantation songs to night the men gathered round him as he began to play my old kentucky home they sang one negro melody after another
while the mulatto sat rocking himself his head thrown back his yellow face lifted its shriveled eyelids never fluttering he was born in the far south on the darnault plantation where the spirit if not the fact of slavery persisted
when he was three weeks old he had an illness which left him totally blind
his mother a buxom young negro wench who was laundress for the darnaults concluded that her blind baby was not right in his head and she was ashamed of him she loved him devotedly but he was so ugly with his sunken eyes and his fidgets
that she hid him away from people all the dainties she brought down from the big house were for the blind child and she beat and cuffed her other children whenever she found them teasing him or trying to get his chicken bone away from him he began to talk early
and his mammy said he was nt all wrong she named him samson because he was blind but on the plantation he was known as yellow marthas simple child
he was docile and obedient but when he was six years old he began to run away from home always taking the same direction he felt his way through the lilacs along the boxwood hedge
whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin she whipped him unmercifully and told him what dreadful things old mister darnault would do to him if he ever found him near the big house but the next time samson had a chance he ran away again
and went toward the window she saw this hideous little pickaninny dressed in an old piece of sacking standing in the open space between the hollyhock rows his body rocking automatically his blind face lifted
though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children one day samson was standing thus while miss nellie was playing her lesson to her music master the windows were open
talk a little while and then leave the room he heard the door close after them he crept up to the front windows and stuck his head in there was no one there he could always detect the presence of any one in a room
he put one foot over the window sill and straddled it his mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him meddling samson had got too near the mastiffs kennel once and had felt his terrible breath in his face
he thought about that but he pulled in his other foot through the dark he found his way to the thing to its mouth he touched it softly and it answered softly kindly he shivered and stood still
then he began to feel it all over ran his finger tips along the slippery sides embraced the carved legs tried to get some conception of its shape and size of the space it occupied in primeval night
it was cold and hard and like nothing else in his black universe he went back to its mouth began at one end of the keyboard and felt his way down into the mellow thunder as far as he could go
he seemed to know that it must be done with the fingers not with the fists or the feet he approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct and coupled himself to it as if he knew it was to piece him out and make a whole creature of him
that lay under the bones of his pinched conical little skull definite as animal desires the door opened miss nellie and her music master stood behind it but blind samson who was so sensitive to presences did not know they were there
he was feeling out the pattern that lay all ready made on the big and little keys when he paused for a moment because the sound was wrong and he wanted another miss nellie spoke softly he whirled about in a spasm of terror
leaped forward in the dark struck his head on the open window and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor he had what his mother called a fit the doctor came and gave him opium when samson was well again his young mistress led him back to the piano
several teachers experimented with him they found he had absolute pitch and a remarkable memory as a very young child he could repeat after a fashion any composition that was played for him no matter how many wrong notes he struck he never lost the intention of a passage
as piano playing it was perhaps abominable but as music it was something real vitalized by a sense of rhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses that not only filled his dark mind but worried his body incessantly
and he were gloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers in the middle of a crashing waltz darnault suddenly began to play softly and turning to one of the men who stood behind him whispered
somebody dancing in there he jerked his bullet head toward the dining room i hear little feet girls i spect anson kirkpatrick mounted a chair and peeped over the transom
springing down he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining room tiny and lena antonia and mary dusak were waltzing in the middle of the floor they separated and fled toward the kitchen giggling kirkpatrick caught tiny by the elbows
whats the matter with you girls dancing out here by yourselves when theres a roomful of lonesome men on the other side of the partition introduce me to your friends tiny the girls still laughing were trying to escape tiny looked alarmed
she protested shed be awful mad if you was to come out here and dance with us missus gardeners in omaha girl
and youre tony and youre mary have i got you all straight oreilly and the others began to pile the chairs on the tables johnnie gardener ran in from the office easy boys easy he entreated them youll wake the cook and therell be the devil to pay for me
s a fact boys he said confidentially
oh well make it all right with molly get your back up johnnie molly was missus gardeners name of course
and on his watch case doubtless on his heart too he was an affectionate little man and he thought his wife a wonderful woman he knew that without her he would hardly be more than a clerk in some other mans hotel at a word from kirkpatrick
over the piano and began to draw the dance music out of it while the perspiration shone on his short wool and on his uplifted face
whenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath he would boom out softly whos that goin back on me one of these city gentlemen i bet now you girls
antonia seemed frightened at first
tiny soderball was trim and slender with lively little feet and pretty ankles she wore her dresses very short she was quicker in speech lighter in movement and manner than the other girls mary dusak was broad and
she looked bold and resourceful and unscrupulous and she was all of these they were handsome girls had the fresh color of their country up bringing and in their eyes that brilliancy which is called by no metaphor alas
the light of youth darnault played until his manager came and shut the piano before he left us he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours and a topaz ring given him by some russian nobleman who delighted in negro melodies
and had heard darnault play in new orleans at last he tapped his way upstairs after bowing to everybody docile and happy i walked home with antonia we were so excited that we dreaded to go to bed
the day after the cutters left antonia came over to see us grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted youve got something on your mind antonia she said anxiously
she hesitated and then told us how strangely mister cutter had behaved before he went away
as he had just put a new yale lock on the front door cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone
or the way he looked at her i feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again
grandmother was apprehensive at once i dont think its right for you to stay there feeling that way i suppose it would nt be right for you to leave the place alone either
maybe jim would be willing to go over there and sleep and you could come here nights id feel safer knowing you were under my own roof i guess jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could
antonia turned to me eagerly oh would you jim
the third night i spent at the cutters i awoke suddenly with the impression that i had heard a door open and shut everything was still however and i must have gone to sleep again immediately
i was only half awake but i decided that he might take the cutters silver whoever he was
i held my breath and lay absolutely still a hand closed softly on my shoulder and at the same moment i felt something hairy and cologne scented brushing my face
the man became insane he stood over me choking me with one fist and beating me in the face with the other hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of abuse so this is what shes up to when im away is it where is she you nasty whelp
where is she under the bed are you hussy i know your tricks wait till i get at you ill fix this rat youve got in here hes caught all right so long as cutter had me by the throat there was no chance for me at all
when i got home i climbed in at the kitchen window i was covered with blood from my nose and lip but i was too sick to do anything about it i found a shawl and an overcoat on the hatrack lay down on the parlor sofa and in spite of my hurts went to sleep
her cry of fright awakened me truly i was a battered object as she helped me to my room i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my lip was cut and stood out like a snout my nose looked like a big blue plum
and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discolored grandmother said we must have the doctor at once but i implored her as i had never begged for anything before not to send for him i could stand anything i told her
she seemed to understand though i was too faint and miserable to go into explanations when she took
she spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me and rubbing me with arnica i heard antonia sobbing outside my door but i asked grandmother to send her away i felt that i never wanted to see her again
she had let me in for all this disgustingness grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that i had been there instead of antonia but i lay with my disfigured face to the wall and felt no particular gratitude
if the story once got abroad i would never hear the last of it i could well imagine what the old men down at the drug store would do with such a theme
and had left again on the six oclock train for denver that morning the agent said his face was striped with court plaster and he carried his left hand in a sling he looked so used up that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten oclock the night before
my own garments had been treated so badly that i never saw them again grandmother burned them in the cutters kitchen range while antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order to leave it the front door bell rang violently
there stood missus cutter locked out for she had no key to the new lock her head trembling with rage i advised her to control herself or she would have a stroke grandmother said afterwards
antonia was frightened and was going home to stay for a while she told missus cutter it would be useless to interrogate the girl for she knew nothing of what had happened then missus cutter told her story
she and her husband had started home from omaha together the morning before they had to stop over several hours at waymore junction to catch the black hawk train
when he returned he told her that he would have to stay overnight there
she saw him slip a twenty dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket that bill she said should have aroused her suspicions at once but did not the trains are never called at little junction towns everybody knows when they come in
mister cutter showed his wifes ticket to the conductor and settled her in her seat before the train moved off
and that cutter must have planned it so the conductor told her the black hawk train was due at waymore twelve minutes after the kansas city train left she saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to black hawk without her
she had no choice but to go on to kansas city and take the first fast train for home cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices he could have left her in the omaha hotel
but apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible mister cutter will pay for this missus burden he will pay missus cutter avouched nodding her horselike head and rolling her eyes
certainly cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil in some way he depended upon the excitement he could arouse in her hysterical nature perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wifes rage and amazement
than from any experiences of his own his zest in debauchery might wane but never missus cutters belief in it the reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on
chapter two after two years of training he went to sea and entering the regions so well known to his imagination found them strangely barren of adventure he made many voyages
he knew the magic monotony of existence between sky and water he had to bear the criticism of men the exactions of the sea and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread but whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work
the edge of his temper and the fibre of his stuff that reveal the quality of his resistance and the secret truth of his pretences not only to others but also to himself
there are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intention that indefinable something which forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man
that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice with a strength beyond control with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear
the sunshine the memories the future which means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple and appalling act of taking his life jim
disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his scottish captain used to say afterwards man its a pairfect meeracle to me how she lived through it spent many days stretched on his back dazed battered hopeless
and tormented as if at the bottom of an abyss of unrest he did not care what the end would be and in his lucid moments overvalued his indifference the danger when not seen has the imperfect vagueness of human thought
he lay there battened down in the midst of a small devastation and felt secretly glad he had not to go on deck but now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip him bodily
and then the unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost then fine weather returned and he thought no more about it
his lameness however persisted and when the ship arrived at an eastern port he had to go to the hospital his recovery was slow and he was left behind
afflicted by some mysterious tropical disease who held the doctor for an ass and indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his tamil servant used to smuggle in with unwearied devotion they told each other the story of their lives
played cards a little or yawning and in pyjamas lounged through the day in easy chairs without saying a word the hospital stood on a hill and a gentle breeze entering through the windows always flung wide open
brought into the bare room the softness of the sky the languor of the earth the bewitching breath of the eastern waters there were perfumes in it suggestions of infinite repose the gift of endless dreams
jim looked every day over the thickets of gardens beyond the roofs of the town over the fronds of palms growing on the shore at that roadstead which is a thoroughfare to the east at the roadstead dotted by garlanded islets
lighted by festal sunshine its ships like toys its brilliant activity resembling a holiday pageant with the eternal serenity of the eastern sky overhead and the smiling peace of the eastern seas
he associated naturally with the men of his calling in the port these were of two kinds some very few and seen there but seldom led mysterious lives
had preserved an undefaced energy with the temper of buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers they appeared to live in a crazy maze of plans hopes dangers enterprises ahead of civilisation in the dark places of the sea
had remained as officers of country ships they had now a horror of the home service with its harder conditions severer view of duty and the hazard of stormy oceans they were attuned to the eternal peace of eastern sky and sea
how this one had an easy billet in japan somewhere and that one was doing well in the siamese navy and in all they said in their actions in their looks in their persons could be detected the soft spot the place of decay
the determination to lounge safely through existence to jim that gossiping crowd viewed as seamen seemed at first more unsubstantial than so many shadows but at length he found a fascination in the sight of those men
in their appearance of doing so well on such a small allowance of danger and toil in time beside the original disdain there grew up slowly another sentiment and suddenly giving up the idea of going home
she was owned by a chinaman chartered by an arab and commanded by a sort of renegade new south wales german very anxious to curse publicly his native country but who apparently on the strength of bismarcks victorious policy
brutalised all those he was not afraid of and wore a blood and iron air combined with a purple nose and a red moustache after she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside eight hundred pilgrims more or less
they streamed aboard over three gangways they streamed in urged by faith and the hope of paradise they streamed in with a continuous tramp and shuffle of bare feet without a word a murmur or a look back
and when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck flowed forward and aft overflowed down the yawning hatchways filled the inner recesses of the ship like water filling a cistern
like water flowing into crevices and crannies like water rising silently even with the rim eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes with affections and memories they had collected there
coming from north and south and from the outskirts of the east after treading the jungle paths descending the rivers coasting in praus along the shallows crossing in small canoes from island to island passing through suffering
meeting strange sights beset by strange fears upheld by one desire they came from solitary huts in the wilderness from populous campongs from villages by the sea at the call of an idea
they had left their forests their clearings the protection of their rulers their prosperity their poverty the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their fathers they came covered with dust with sweat with grime with rags
the strong men at the head of family parties the lean old men pressing forward without hope of return young boys with fearless eyes glancing curiously shy little girls with tumbled long hair
the timid women muffled up and clasping to their breasts wrapped in loose ends of soiled head cloths their sleeping babies the unconscious pilgrims of an exacting belief
said the german skipper to his new chief mate an arab the leader of that pious voyage came last he walked slowly aboard handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban a string of servants followed loaded with his luggage
and on the secret purposes of their hearts the steamer pounded in the dusk the calm water of the strait and far astern of the pilgrim ship a screw pile lighthouse planted by unbelievers on a treacherous shoal seemed to wink at her
its eye of flame as if in derision of her errand of faith she cleared the strait crossed the bay continued on her way through the one degree passage she held on straight for the red sea under a serene sky
enveloped in a fulgor of sunshine that killed all thought oppressed the heart withered all impulses of strength and energy and under the sinister splendour of that sky the sea blue and profound remained still without a stir
without a ripple without a wrinkle viscous stagnant dead the patna with a slight hiss passed over that plain luminous and smooth unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky
glided past on his descent and sank mysteriously into the sea evening after evening preserving the same distance ahead of her advancing bows the five whites on board lived amidships isolated from the human cargo
the awnings covered the deck with a white roof from stem to stern and a faint hum a low murmur of sad voices alone revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the ocean
such were the days still hot heavy disappearing one by one into the past as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake of the ship and the ship lonely under a wisp of smoke
held on her steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity as if scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity
he said speaking of the ship she went over whatever it was as easy as a snake crawling over a stick the illustration was good the questions were aiming at facts
and the official inquiry was being held in the police court of an eastern port he stood elevated in the witness box with burning cheeks in a cool lofty room
the big framework of punkahs moved gently to and fro high above his head and from below many eyes were looking at him out of dark faces out of white faces out of red faces out of faces attentive spellbound
as if all these people sitting in orderly rows upon narrow benches had been enslaved by the fascination of his voice it was very loud it rang startling in his own ears it was the only sound audible in the world
for the terribly distinct questions that extorted his answers seemed to shape themselves in anguish and pain within his breast came to him poignant and silent
outside the court the sun blazed within was the wind of great punkahs that made you shiver the shame that made you burn the attentive eyes whose glance stabbed the face of the presiding magistrate
clean shaved and impassible looked at him deadly pale between the red faces of the two nautical assessors the light of a broad window under the ceiling fell from above on the heads and shoulders of the three men
as if facts could explain anything after you had concluded you had collided with something floating awash say a water logged wreck you were ordered by your captain to go forward and ascertain if there was any damage done
looking at jim with thoughtful blue eyes the other a heavy scornful man thrown back in his seat his left arm extended full length drummed delicately with his finger tips on a blotting pad in the middle the magistrate
i was told to call no one and to make no noise for fear of creating a panic i thought the precaution reasonable i took one of the lamps that were hung under the awnings and went forward after opening the forepeak hatch i heard splashing in there
his fingers played incessantly touching the paper without noise i did not think of danger just then i might have been a little startled all this happened in such a quiet way and so very suddenly
i knew there was no other bulkhead in the ship but the collision bulkhead separating the forepeak from the forehold i went back to tell the captain i came upon the second engineer getting up at the foot of the bridge ladder he seemed dazed and
told me he thought his left arm was broken he had slipped on the top step when getting down while i was forward he exclaimed my god that rotten bulkheadll give way in a minute
he did not strike him again he stood bending over him and speaking angrily but quite low
stop the engines instead of making a row about it on deck i heard him say get up run fly he swore also the engineer slid down the starboard ladder and bolted round the skylight to the engine room companion
which was on the port side he moaned as he ran he spoke slowly he remembered swiftly and with extreme vividness he could have reproduced like an echo the moaning of the engineer for the better information of these men
who wanted facts after his first feeling of revolt he had come round to the view that only a meticulous precision of statement would bring out the true horror behind the appalling face of things
the facts those men were so eager to know had been visible tangible open to the senses occupying their place in space and time requiring for their existence a fourteen hundred ton steamer
perdition that dwelt within like a malevolent soul in a detestable body he was anxious to make this clear this had not been a common affair everything in it had been of the utmost importance
and fortunately he remembered everything he wanted to go on talking for truths sake perhaps for his own sake also and while his utterance was deliberate his mind positively flew round and round the serried circle of facts
he seemed calm enough only he stumbled several times and once as i stood speaking to him he walked right into me as though he had been stone blind he made no definite answer to what i had to tell
felt a shiver run down his back the big assessor had dropped his eyelids and drummed on without a sound careless and mournful the eyes of the other above the sunburnt clasped fingers
the magistrate had swayed forward
he rested his temple in the palm of his hand the wind of the punkahs eddied down on the heads on the dark faced natives wound about in voluminous draperies on the europeans sitting together very hot
and in drill suits that seemed to fit them as close as their skins and holding their round pith hats on their knees while gliding along the walls the court peons buttoned tight in long white coats flitted rapidly to and fro
rested upon a white man who sat apart from the others with his face worn and clouded but with quiet eyes that glanced straight interested and clear jim answered another question and was tempted to cry out
whats the good of this whats the good he tapped with his foot slightly bit his lip and looked away over the heads he met the eyes of the white man the glance directed at him was not the fascinated stare of the others
it was an act of intelligent volition jim between two questions forgot himself so far as to find leisure for a thought this fellow ran the thought looks at me as though he could see somebody or something past my shoulder
he had come across that man before in the street perhaps he was positive he had never spoken to him for days for many days he had spoken to no one but had held silent incoherent and endless converse with himself
like a prisoner alone in his cell or like a wayfarer lost in a wilderness at present he was answering questions that did not matter though they had a purpose but he doubted whether he would ever again speak out as long as he lived
the sound of his own truthful statements confirmed his deliberate opinion that speech was of no use to him any longer that man there seemed to be aware of his hopeless difficulty jim looked at him then turned away
and audibly perhaps it would be after dinner on a verandah draped in motionless foliage and crowned with flowers in the deep dusk speckled by fiery cigar ends the elongated bulk of each cane chair
harboured a silent listener now and then a small red glow would move abruptly and expanding light up the fingers of a languid hand part of a face in profound repose or flash a crimson gleam into a pair of pensive eyes
overshadowed by a fragment of an unruffled forehead and with the very first word uttered marlows body extended at rest in the seat would become very still as though his spirit had winged its way back into the lapse of time
at his back was the dark night with the clear stars whose distant glitter disposed in retreating planes lured the eye into the depths of a greater darkness
and yet a mysterious light seemed to show me his boyish head as if in that moment the youth within him had for a moment glowed and expired you are an awful good sort to listen
like this he said it does me good you dont know what it is to me you dont words seemed to fail him it was a distinct glimpse he was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you
of the sort you like to imagine yourself to have been of the sort whose appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought gone out extinct cold and which as if rekindled at the approach of another flame
you dont know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed make a clean breast of it to an elder man it is so difficult so awfully unfair so hard to understand
the mists were closing again i dont know how old i appeared to him and how much wise not half as old as i felt just then not half as uselessly wise as i knew myself to be
surely in no other craft as in that of the sea do the hearts of those already launched to sink or swim go out so much to the youth on the brink looking with shining eyes upon that
glitter of the vast surface which is only a reflection of his own glances full of fire there is such magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven each of us to sea such a glorious indefiniteness
such a beautiful greed of adventures that are their own and only reward what we get well we wont talk of that but can one of us restrain a smile
in no other kind of life is the illusion more wide of reality in no other is the beginning all illusion the disenchantment more swift the subjugation more complete
hadnt we all commenced with the same desire ended with the same knowledge carried the memory of the same cherished glamour through the sordid days of imprecation what wonder that when some
heavy prod gets home the bond is found to be close that besides the fellowship of the craft there is felt the strength of a wider feeling the feeling that binds a man to a child he was there before me believing that
and he had been deliberating upon death confound him he had found that to meditate about because he thought he had saved his life while all its glamour had gone with the ship in the night what more natural
and his voice spoke i was so lost you know it was the sort of thing one does not expect to happen to one it was not like a fight for instance
he appeared changed as if he had suddenly matured one couldnt be sure he muttered ah you were not sure i said
and was placated by the sound of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird in the night well i wasnt he said courageously it was something like that wretched story they made up it was not a lie
but it wasnt truth all the same it was something one knows a downright lie there was not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the right and the wrong of this affair
how much more did you want i asked but i think i spoke so low that he did not catch what i said he had advanced his argument as though life had been a network of
his voice sounded reasonable suppose i had not i mean to say suppose i had stuck to the ship well how much longer say a minute half a minute
i interjected i would have meant to be he retorted and thats more than i meant when i he shivered as if about to swallow some nauseous drug jumped
he pronounced with a convulsive effort whose stress as if propagated by the waves of the air made my body stir a little in the chair he fixed me with lowering eyes dont you believe me he cried i swear
i ought to have known i am i am a gentleman too yes yes i said hastily he was looking me squarely in the face and withdrew his gaze slowly
now you understand why i didnt after all didnt go out in that way i wasnt going to be frightened at what i had done and anyhow if i had stuck to the ship i would have done my best to be saved
men have been known to float for hours in the open sea and be picked up not much the worse for it i might have lasted it out better than many others theres nothing the matter with my heart
a hairs breadth he muttered not the breadth of a hair between this and that and at the time it is difficult to see a hair at midnight i put in
a little viciously i fear dont you see what i mean by the solidarity of the craft i was aggrieved against him as though he had cheated me
keep up the illusion of my beginnings as though he had robbed our common life of the last spark of its glamour and so you cleared out at once jumped he corrected me incisively jumped mind
he repeated and i wondered at the evident but obscure intention well yes perhaps i could not see then but i had plenty of time and any amount of light in that boat and i could think too
nobody would know of course but this did not make it any easier for me youve got to believe that too i did not want all this talk no yes i wont lie
i wanted it it is the very thing i wanted there do you think you or anybody could have made me if i i am i am not afraid to tell and i wasnt afraid to think either i looked it in the face
i wasnt going to run away at first at night if it hadnt been for those fellows i might have no by heavens i was not going to give them that satisfaction they had done enough they made up a story and believed it for all i know
but i knew the truth and i would live it down alone with myself i wasnt going to give in to such a beastly unfair thing what did it prove after all i was confoundedly cut up sick of life
no the proper thing was to face it out alone for myself wait for another chance
adam understood dinahs haste to go away and drew hope rather than discouragement from it
i wish id asked her to write to me though he thought and yet
she wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while and ive no right to be impatient and interrupting her with my wishes shes told me what her mind is and shes not a woman to say one thing and mean another
ill wait patiently that was adams wise resolution and it throve excellently for the first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got
but towards the middle of october the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly and showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion the weeks were unusually long dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind
he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second he treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her and makes light of all difficulties
but that sort of glow dies out memory gets sadly diluted with time and is not strong enough to revive us adam was no longer so confident as he had been he began to fear that perhaps dinahs old life
would have too strong a grasp upon her
if she had not felt this she would surely have written to him to give him some comfort but it appeared that she held it right to discourage him as adams confidence waned his patience waned with it
and he thought he must write himself he must ask dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was needful he sat up late one night to write her a letter but the next morning he burnt it afraid of its effect
it would be worse to have a discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips for her presence reconciled him to her will you perceive how it was adam was hungering for the sight of dinah
and when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage a lover is likely to still it though he may have to put his future in pawn but what harm could he do by going to snowfield dinah could not be displeased with him for it
she had not forbidden him to go she must surely expect that he would go before long by the second sunday in october
that he was already on his way to snowfield on horseback this time for his hours were precious now and he had borrowed jonathan burges good nag for the journey what keen memories went along the road with him
he had often been to oakbourne and back since that first journey to snowfield but beyond oakbourne the greystone walls the broken country the meagre trees seemed to be telling him afresh
the story of that painful past which he knew so well by heart but no story is the same to us after a lapse of time or rather we who read it are no longer the same interpreters and adam
this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey country thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of the past that is a base
and selfish even a blasphemous spirit which rejoices and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed another because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to ourselves
adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human sorrow which had been brought so close to him he could never thank god for anothers misery and if i were capable of that narrow sighted joy in adams behalf
i should still know he was not the man to feel it for himself he would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said evils evil and sorrows sorrow
by wrapping it up in other words other folks were not created for my sake that i should think all square when things turn out well for me but it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life
which a sad experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain surely it is not possible to feel otherwise any more than it would be possible
by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day the growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty
we can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner or a philosopher to his less complete formula
something like this sense of enlarged being was in adams mind this sunday morning as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past
the hope of passing his life with her had been the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from snowfield eighteen months ago had been leading him tender and deep as his love for hetty had been
so deep that the roots of it would never be torn away his love for dinah was better and more precious to him for it was the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his acquaintance with deep sorrow
its like as if it was a new strength to me he said to himself to love her and know as she loves me
for shes better than i am
as if you could walk more fearless when youve more trust in another
ive always been thinking i knew better than them as belonged to me
when you cant look to them nearest to you t help you with a bit better thought
when adam came in sight of the grey town on the hill side and looked searchingly towards the green valley below for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near the ugly red mill the scene looked less harsh in the soft
october sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring and the one grand charm it possessed in common with all wide stretching woodless regions
that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching sky had a milder more soothing influence than usual on this almost cloudless day adams doubts and fears melted under this influence
as the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear blue above him he seemed to see dinahs gentle face assuring him with its looks alone of all he longed to know
he did not expect dinah to be at home at this hour but he got down from his horse and tied it at the little gate
he had set his mind on following her and bringing her home she was gone to slomans end a hamlet about three miles off over the hill the old woman told him
to preach in a cottage there as her habit was
so adam got on his horse again and rode to the town putting up at the old inn and taking a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord from whose friendly questions and reminiscences
he was glad to escape as soon as possible and set out towards slomans end with all his haste it was nearly four oclock before he could set off
the little grey desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering trees lay in sight long before he reached it and as he came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn
perhaps thats the last hymn before they come away adam thought ill walk back a bit and turn again to meet her farther off the village he walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again
and seated himself on a loose stone against the low wall to watch till he should see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill he chose this spot almost at the top of the hill
because it was away from all eyes no house no cattle not even a nibbling sheep near no presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky
she was much longer coming than he expected he waited an hour at least watching for her and thinking of her while the afternoon shadows lengthened and the light grew softer at last he saw the little black figure
coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching the foot of the hill slowly adam thought but dinah was really walking at her usual pace with a light quiet step
now she was beginning to wind along the path up the hill but adam would not move yet he would not meet her too soon he had set his heart on meeting her in this assured loneliness and now he began to fear
lest he should startle her too much yet he thought shes not one to be overstartled shes always so calm and quiet as if she was prepared for anything what was she thinking of as she wound up the hill
perhaps she had found complete repose without him and had ceased to feel any need of his love on the verge of a decision we all tremble hope pauses with fluttering wings but now at last she was very near
and adam rose from the stone wall it happened that just as he walked forward dinah had paused and turned round to look back at the village
adam was glad for with the fine instinct of a lover he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw him he came within three paces of her and then said dinah
she started without looking round as if she connected the sound with no place dinah adam said again
what was in her mind she was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the voice but this second time she looked round
what a look of yearning love it was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark eyed man she did not start again at the sight of him she said nothing but moved towards him so that his arm could clasp her round
and they walked on so in silence while the warm tears fell adam was content and said nothing it was dinah who spoke first adam she said it is the divine will
my soul is so knit to yours that it is but a divided life i live without you and this moment now you are with me and i feel that our hearts are filled with the same love i have a fulness of strength
to bear and do our heavenly fathers will that i had lost before adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes then well never part any more dinah till death parts us and they kissed each other

the confession of odette rider he could only gaze in stupified silence you he said wonderingly the girl was pale and her eyes never left his face she nodded yes it is i she said in a low voice
you he said again and walked towards her he held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word sit down he said kindly he thought she was going to faint i hope i didnt hurt you i hadnt the slightest idea
she shook her head oh im not hurt she said wearily
she drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands and he stood by embarrassed almost terrified by this unexpected development so you were the visitor on the bicycle he said at last i didnt suspect
it struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for odette rider to go up to her mothers house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers if there was any crime at all
she looked up at his words i on the bicycle she asked no it was not i not you she shook her head i was in the grounds
i saw you using your lamp and i was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listlessly but i was not on the bicycle who was it he asked she shook her head may i have that please
she held out her hand and he hesitated after all he had no right or title to this curious purse he compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it odette he said gently and walked round to her
laying his hand on her shoulder why dont you tell me tell you what she asked without looking up tell me all there is to be told he said i could help you i want to help you she looked up at him
he was tongue tied for a second because i love you he said and his voice shook it did not seem to him that he was talking the words came of their own volition he had no more intention of telling her he loved her indeed
he had no more idea that he did love her than whiteside would have had yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips the effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him
she did not shrink back she did not look surprised she showed no astonishment whatever
oh that calm
was the second shock of the evening it was as though she had known it all along he was on his knees by her side and his arm was about her shoulders even before his brain had willed the act my girl my girl he said gently wont you please tell me
her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible tell you what she asked what you know of this business he said dont you realise how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion
what business do you mean he hesitated the murder of thornton lyne i know nothing of that she made no response to that tender arm of his but sat rigid something in her attitude chilled him
and he dropped her hand and rose when she looked up she saw that his face was white and set he walked to the door and unlocked it im not going to ask you any more he said quietly you know best why you came to me to night
she got up to her feet unsteadily and swayed toward him in a second he was by her side his arms about her she made no resistance but rather he felt a yielding towards him which he had missed before her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her
odette odette he whispered dont you realise that i love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness wont you tell me everything please no no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice please dont ask me
i am afraid oh i am afraid he crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair but there is nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly if you were as guilty as hell i would save you
if you are shielding somebody i would shield them because i love you odette no no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest dont ask me dont ask me ask me tarling swung round
there was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him milburgh he said between his teeth milburgh smiled the other mockingly i am sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene
but the occasion is a desperate one and i cannot afford to stand on ceremony mister tarling tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager one comprehensive glance the detective gave him
noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood so you were the cyclist eh he said thats right said milburgh it is an exercise to which i am very partial what do you want asked tarling alert and watchful
i want you to carry out your promise mister tarling said milburgh smoothly tarling stared at him my promise he said what promise to protect not only the evil doer
tarling started do you mean to say he said hoarsely do you mean to accuse i accuse nobody said milburgh with a wide sweep of his hands i merely suggest that both miss rider and myself are in very serious trouble
and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow tarling took one step towards him and milburgh shrank back do you accuse miss rider of complicity in this murder he demanded milburgh smiled
but it was an uneasy smile i make no accusation he said
he shrugged his shoulders you will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which i was endeavouring to remove to a place of safety tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it i shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said
locks will present very little difficulty
and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which dangled a small bunch of keys here is the key he said unlock and read to night tarling took the key in his hand inserted it in first one tiny lock and then in the other
the catches snapped open and he threw back the flap then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girls quivering face and read the terror in her eyes no no she cried almost beside herself no for gods sake no
tarling stepped back he saw the malicious little smile on milburghs face and could have struck him down miss rider does not wish me to see what is in this case he said
here it was the girls voice surprisingly clear and steady her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it toward the detective there is a reason she said in a low voice
milburgh had gone too far tarling saw his face lengthen and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes then without further hesitation he opened the paper and read the first line took away his breath the confession of odette rider
good god he muttered and read on
he will never forgive i was walking away when a man touched me some one had seen me come from the doctors office a few minutes before of course this meant detention till the coroner should arrive
i quarreled with the circumstances but felt forced to submit happily jupp now came to the front and i was able to send him to new york to keep that watch over missus carew without which i could not have rested quiet an hour
one great element of danger was removed most remarkably if not providentially from the path i had marked out for myself but there still remained that of this womans possible impulses
under her great determination to keep gwendolen in her own care but with jupp to watch the dock and a man in plain clothes at the door of the small hotel she was at present bound for i thought i might remain in yonkers contentedly the whole day
missus carew and the child were still at the address she had given me all looked well in that direction
miss porter who came in haste to greet me wore the careworn look of a long and unrelieved vigil
how could i she asked when missus ocumpaugh did not close her eyes she did not even lie down but sat all night in an arm chair which she had wheeled into gwendolens room
staring like one who sees nothing out into the night through the window which overlooks the river this morning we can not make her speak her eyes are dry with fever only now and then she utters a little moan
the doctor says she will not live to see her husband unless something comes to rouse her but the papers give no news and all the attempts of the police end in nothing
you saw what a dismal failure their last attempt was the child on which they counted proved to be both red haired and pock marked gwendolen appears to be lost lost
in spite of the despair thus expressed my way seemed to open a little i think i can break missus ocumpaughs dangerous apathy if you will let me see her again will you let me try the nurse we have a nurse now
will not consent i fear then telephone to the doctor tell him i am the only man who can do anything for missus ocumpaugh this will not be an exaggeration wait i will get his order
i do not know why i have so much confidence in you in another fifteen minutes she came to lead me to missus ocumpaugh i entered without knocking they told me to she was seated as they said in a large chair
but with no ease to herself for she was not even leaning against its back
where from what she had intimated to me in our last interview
there was a miniature in her hand but i saw at first glance that it was not the face of gwendolen over which her fingers closed so spasmodically it was her husbands portrait which she held
and it was his face aroused and full of denunciation which she evidently saw in her fancy as i drew nearer her in my efforts to attract her attention for a shiver suddenly contracted her lovely features
and she threw her arms out as if to ward from herself something which she had no power to meet in doing this her head turned slightly and she saw me instantly the spell under which she sat frozen
yielded to a recognition of something besides her own terrible brooding she let her arms drop and the lips which had not spoken that morning moved slightly i waited respectfully
i saw that in another moment she would speak you have come she panted out at last to hear my decision it is too soon the steamer has twenty four hours yet before it can make port
i have not finished weighing my life against the good opinion of him i live for then faintly missus carew has gone to new york i finished no farther than that
she asked anxiously she has not sailed i did not see how it was compatible with my duty to let her missus ocumpaughs whole form collapsed the dangerous apathy was creeping over her again
you are deciding for me she spoke very faintly you and doctor pool
no not yet i wanted her to choose the noble course for mister ocumpaughs sake yes and for her own no i ventured to rejoin you are the only one who can settle your own fate
the word must come from you i am only trying to make it possible for you to meet your husband without any additional wrong to blunt his possible forgiveness oh he will never forgive
and i have lost all and the set look returned in its full force
missus ocumpaugh we may never have another moment together in confidence there is one thing i have never told you something which i think you ought to know as it may affect your whole future course
it concerns gwendolens real mother you say you do not know her no
my darling is happy with missus carew too happy
alarmed i put out my hand in a soothing gesture
i made haste to say listen to my little story it will not add to your pain rather alleviate it
i also knew that this patient had overheard what you said as well as i for impervious as the door looked i had often heard the doctors mutterings when he thought i was safe beyond ear shot if not asleep
yes she was ready to make her compact with the doctor just as you had done before she left everything was arranged for it was her child you took reared loved and have now lost
at another time she might have resented these words especially the last but i had roused her curiosity her panting eager curiosity and she let them pass altogether unchallenged did you see this woman
was she of common blood common manners it does not seem possible gwendolen is by nature so dainty in all her ways the woman was a lady i did not see her face it was heavily veiled
but i heard her voice it was a ladys voice and what she wore beautiful jewels jewels you said she was poor so she declared herself but she had on her neck under her coat
a string of beads which were both valuable and of exquisite workmanship i know because it broke just as she was leaving and the beads fell all over the floor and one rolled my way and i picked it up scamp that i was
when both their backs were turned in their search for the others a bead a costly bead and you were not found out no missus ocumpaugh she never seemed to miss it
to count correctly she thought she had them all but this has been in my pocket for six years perhaps you have seen its like
till yesterday yesterday her great eyes haggard with suffering rose to mine then they fell on the bead which i had taken from my pocket the cry she gave was not loud but it effectually settled all my doubts
i asked impressively for minutes she did not answer she was trembling like a leaf her mother she exclaimed at last her mother her own mother
and she never hinted it to me by word or look oh valerie valerie what tortures we have both suffered and now you are happy while i grief seemed to engulf her
feeling my position keenly i walked to the window but soon turned and came back in response to her cry i must see missus carew instantly
they will think i have gone to be on hand to meet mister ocumpaugh and will say that i have not the strength override their objections i put my whole cause in your hands you will go with me
with pleasure madam and thus was that terrifying apathy broken up
her willingness to break our friendship at the first opportunity gave me little room to think of anything else that she should risk her reputation to run after that man was inexplicable but it was just like a woman
if she could get along without me i could get along without her im the easiest going person in the world but when it comes to allowing the girl you are practically engaged to to make a fool of herself over another man i wont stand for it
and she didnt know but i made up my mind that she would have to give me an awfully good reason for her sudden interest in frank woods before i would forgive her these thoughts held my attention all the way out
now and again i would be recalled from my gloom by some question from the coroner he was trying to solve the problem of who murdered jim
as we neared the bridge i noticed again how scant the vegetation was on both sides of the road any one wishing to murder jim would have been able to see him coming
could be seen the thirteenth hole of the country club golf links when we reached the crest of the hill leading down to the bridge our eyes at once caught sight of a tall maple tree on the right hand side of the road and about two hundred yards from it
as he saw it the coroner gave a grunt of satisfaction theres our tree we stopped the car and scrambled through the thorny bushes that lined the road the ground was hard clay with only burdock and weeds growing on it
there was nothing that would lead us to believe that any one had been there before when we reached the tree the coroner examined the ground around it carefully when he arose he seemed disappointed what did you expect to find here i asked
i didnt know what we might find if the man who fired those shots used this tree i thought we might find an empty cartridge or two there ought to be at least some broken twigs or something to show that he was up there but i find nothing at all
still the fact that the tree is where it is makes the theory plausible he shook his head no now that ive seen how far we are from the road i dont think it does
those bullet holes in the back of the car were fired from above and behind the machine they slanted down but not sidewise
but if the murderer used this tree two hundred yards from the road he would have started firing before the car came opposite
im sorry for when i saw this tree i thought wed struck the right track theres one thing i cant make out i stated and that is the strange cry of my sister in her delirium look out jim its going to hit us she called out
and i would be willing to swear it had something to do with the murder the coroner thought a moment then turned to me what else did she say nothing that seemed to refer to the accident all the rest was apparently delirium
she begged forgiveness for some fancied wrong and repeated that a certain man was not guilty of dishonesty but her first weird cry had to do with the murder im sure
everything points to an aeroplane it was done a hundred yes a thousand times in the war while i was over there with my hospital unit we used to get a lot of cases of motorcycle despatch riders who had been picked off by german aviators
and is the head of an aeroplane firm but i dont think he has an aeroplane here he could get one easy enough the clever devil look over there he had the broad sweep of the golf course as a perfect landing ground
helpless before approaching death i could imagine helens agony as she saw that dim black shape
look out jim its going to hit us yes but how are we going to prove it i asked thats up to us now an aeroplane has such speed that it was easy for woods to fashion an ingenious alibi
to account for every minute of his time on the night of the murder but there must be some holes in it there always is in a manufactured alibi i want you to go over to the country club and check up mister woods schedule of that night
while i examine the golf links to see if he landed there we jumped into my car and drove rapidly to the club i went into the house by the back way to avoid meeting people and asked for jackson
jackson what time did mister woods get out here on the evening mister felderson was killed
did you see him at that time
when was the first time you did see him jackson ah guess it was at dinnah time suh
youre sure he was here all through dinner i asked yes suh he must hab been cause he ohdahd dinnah what time was he through dinner do you know the darky scratched his head ah reckon it war
i asked the boy was trembling he rolled frightened eyes toward jackson who was glaring at him finally he broke into a wail
motioning the angry jackson away he he set down at de table but he aint eat none the boy stuttered what do you mean george
ah brung him some soup but he got up powful sudden lak he had a call to de telephome an he aint come back are you sure of that george yas suh
ah ast him did he want dinnah aftah he come back but he say he aint hongry what time was it when he came back i asked
i gave the boy a dollar and he went away happy jackson had a sheepish look on his face then mister woods wasnt here all through dinner jackson drat dat boy
he make me out a liah fo a dollah he grinned are you sure absolutely sure that you saw mister woods at half past eight i questioned yas suh you caint catch me up no mo
grogan do you remember who was in the bar between seven thirty and eight thirty on the night of the felderson murder only one or two of the gentlemen sir there was mister farnsworth and mister brown and i think mister woods
are you sure mister woods was in here well no sir not exactly i remember mister farnsworth and mister brown there were probably some others the reason i think mister woods was here
was because he called my attention to the fact a few nights after the murder there were a few gentlemen in here and they were talking of mister feldersons death mister woods said in view of the fact that the murderer hadnt been found
almost any one might be accused some one asked him if he was worried we all knew sir that mister felderson and mister woods were not very friendly and mister woods laughed and said that fortunately he had a perfect alibi
oh his alibi is good of course because he was around the club all that evening i guess he was here and i dont remember it i shook hands with him and left far out on the golf links the coroner was bending over examining something on the ground
paralleling each other for almost a hundred yards
they untied it and led it away some of them put their clothes on the donkeys back for a king must ride in comfort others spread their clothes out on the street for a king should ride in state
jesus got on the donkey and started for jerusalem the disciples walked ahead when they had almost reached the city the disciples began to shout jesus used to say that they must not tell anyone that he was the messiah
but now they could tell the whole world for jesus wanted everyone to know they were glad that they did not have to be quiet any longer
and was a cry of welcome they shouted the words of a psalm hosanna to the son of david
hosanna in the highest the city was crowded with travelers from all over palestine and from foreign countries too they were the pilgrims who had come for the passover feast the crowds saw the procession coming they saw the donkey
some of the crowds began to shout with the disciples a great cry of hosanna went ringing down the street everyone seemed to be saying it
some cut branches from the trees and waved them before the messiah it was a royal welcome only the priests and the rulers and the pharisees were sorry to see jesus come what is there we can do they said to one another
who is this they asked others who knew him answered why this is jesus the prophet from nazareth in galilee
this was his fathers house and his house these were his fathers people and his people the king for whom the jews had been waiting had come at last to reign
this time he carried a whip in the court of the gentiles the money was clinking as it had done when jesus was a boy at tables sat the men who grew rich by exchanging the money of visitors for coins used in jerusalem
others were selling doves for sacrifice the poor had to pay heavily to worship god in his own house jesus strode down the room with the whip in his hand and upset the tables where the money was
when the men jumped up from their chairs he drove them out of the temple then he drove the sheep and the cattle out after the men it is written in the scriptures gods house shall be a house of prayer
but you have made it into a den of thieves and robbers he cried this was too much for the priests of the temple and all the important men who ruled jerusalem the next day some of the rulers came to jesus and said
what right have you to do these things who told you that you could act like this so far jesus had never said that he was the messiah
but jesus was too quick for them he said ill answer your question if you answer a question of mine when john the baptist used to preach to you and baptize people who gave him the right to do that
then the rulers did not know what to say they thought to themselves now if we say that john was sent by god to preach he will say why didnt you listen to him then if we say that john didnt have any right to preach
neither am i going to tell you what right i have to do these things every day that week jesus came and taught in the temple several times his enemies tried to trick him into saying something that would turn the people against him
but jesus always had an answer which silenced them once they came and asked should we pay taxes to the romans that was a hard question
everybody would hate him too but if he said they should not pay the taxes well they could count on the roman governor to settle with jesus then
there was a mans picture stamped on one side of it jesus said whose picture is that why they answered that is a picture of caesar the emperor of rome all right said jesus
do whatever your duty is to caesar and his government you will have to decide about that for yourselves and also do your duty to god it was such a clever answer that no one had a word to say
watch out for the scribes and the pharisees he told the people and dont be like them they love to walk around in their long white robes and to have everybody bow to them in the street and to sit in the best seats in the synagogues and at dinners
which people walk over without knowing what is underneath nobody knows how bad you are you snakes how can you escape the punishment which god is bringing upon you he left the pharisees and went into the temple
where people were making their gifts to god
then came a poor widow who put two small coins into the box jesus called his disciples to him and said i tell you this poor widow has given more than all these rich people are giving
and it doesnt cost them anything to give what they do but this poor woman needs her money and she has given all she has with many words and stories he taught the people who thronged around him on the days of that week
and this was the last story he ever told someday i shall sit upon my throne and judge all the nations of the earth to some people i will say come my heavenly father loves you
take the reward he has planned for you to have for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you took me into your homes
i had nothing to wear and you gave me clothes i was sick and in prison and you came to visit me then these people will be surprised and say lord when did we ever do anything for you
then i will say to others go away god wants nothing to do with you for i was hungry and thirsty and naked and sick and in prison and you did nothing at all for me
these people will also be surprised they will say lord
if we had seen you needing anything we would have helped you and i will say many poor people needed your help and you did not help them when you failed them you failed me and now it is too late
if he heard that there was someone in jerusalem pretending to be king of the jews the priests and the rulers wanted to kill jesus that was all they talked about but they did not know how it was to be done
for whenever jesus came to jerusalem great crowds gathered around him none of the priests dared to lay a finger on him in the open the crowds would never let them it seemed to the people as if the messiah might have come at last
but something had to be done the priests and the rulers said the week was going by
we shall have to do away with jesus quietly someone said yes the others agreed we cant wait till the day of the passover if we should do anything to him on that day there would be a riot
they were at their wits end to know how to get rid of jesus the craftiest men in jerusalem could not think what to do there was a knock at the door it was one of jesus twelve disciples
what will you give me judas said if i turn jesus over to you the priests and rulers could hardly believe their ears thirty pieces of silver you shall have they cried if you give us jesus
so for thirty pieces of silver judas agreed to show them where jesus was at some time when there was no one around but the twelve disciples send soldiers when i tell you judas said
the other disciples will all be there and the soldiers wont know which man to take but i will go up to jesus and kiss him the man i kiss will be the one you want
friday was a comfortable day in the household of king everybody was in good humour the story girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and jinns of eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of carlisle workaday folks
she was in turn an oriental princess behind a silken veil the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of palestine disguised as a page the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a coranto
with a highwayman on a moonlit heath and buskirks girl who joined the sons and daughters of temperance just to see what was into it and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated
cecily and sara ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine
chancing accidentally i vow to overhear certain of these secrets i learned that sara ray had named an apple for johnny price and cecily trues you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love
while cecily admitted that willy fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her if you love me as i love you no knife can cut our love in two but sara ray never you breathe this to a living soul
cecily how old must we be before we can have a real beau but sara always denied it so i am inclined to believe felix simply made it up himself paddy distinguished himself by catching a rat
and being intolerably conceited about it until sara ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears then pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping
very few cats have and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon paddy had a finer taste the story girl and i were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking
the story girl would box his ears with her fist and say bless your gray heart paddy youre a good sort of old rascal and pat would purr his satisfaction i used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say
pat youve forgotten more than any human being ever knew and i vow paddy would lick his chops with delight but to be called a sweet cat oh sara sara
felicity tried and had the most gratifying luck with a new and complicated cake recipe a gorgeous compound
the number of eggs she used in it would have shocked aunt janets thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse uncle roger ate three slices of it at tea time and told felicity she was an artist
the poor man meant it as a compliment but felicity who knew uncle blair was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasnt
id like to sighed felicity but wed come home tired and with all the milking to do you boys better go alone peter and i will attend to the milking for one evening said uncle roger you can all go
i have an idea that a raspberry pie for to morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her
a pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spice sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight the raspberries were plentiful
then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies and the story girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glen where a fair white lady dwelt
who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright and if you drank of the cup with her said the story girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with a fairy bride
i think there is such a place in spite of uncle edward said the story girl dreamily and i think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it
one bitter day when they seek it
and that is the tragedy of life on that day the gates of eden are shut behind them and the age of gold is over henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again
they and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles the world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story tellers
as we sat there the awkward man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side he did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods
he strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed the story girl kissed her fingertips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her
youd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him they say its pitiful to see him i must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the story girl
if i put it off any longer it will be too late im growing so fast aunt olivia says ill have to wear ankle skirts next summer if i begin to look grown up hell get frightened of me and then ill never find out the golden milestone mystery
do you think hell ever tell you who alice is i asked i have a notion who alice is already said the mysterious creature but she would tell us nothing more when the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward
and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring when we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights off to the west was a daffodil glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets
and i got back about fifteen minutes ago i set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once i heard a bell ring in the house eight times i tell you i was skeered i made a bolt for the orchard and you wont catch me going near that house till your uncle roger comes home
there we stood in a huddled demoralized group oh what an eerie place that orchard was what shadows what noises
well heres the key go and see for yourself said peter felicity had no intention of going and seeing i think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex you ought to be braver than girls
somebody killed or something like that you know nothing like that ever happened in our family the kings have always been respectable perhaps it is emily
kings ghost whispered felix she never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the story girl oh oh children isnt there something under uncle alecs tree we peered fearfully through the gloom there was something something that wavered and fluttered advanced retreated
thats only my old apron said felicity i hung it there to day when i was looking for the white hens nest oh what shall we do uncle roger may not be back for hours i cant believe theres anything in the house maybe its only peg bowen suggested dan
there was not a great deal of comfort in this we were almost as much afraid of peg bowen as we would be of any spectral visitant peter scoffed at the idea peg bowen wasnt in the house before your uncle roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards he said
no it isnt peg bowen its something that walks i know a story about a ghost said the story girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity it is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes
dont cried cecily hysterically dont you go on dont you say another word i cant bear it dont you the story girl didnt but she had said enough
all at once something leaped from the bough of a tree and alighted before us we split the air with a simultaneous shriek
he struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps
he was a strange furtive animal a questing beast presently the moon rose but this only made matters worse the shadows had been still before now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs the old house with its dreadful secret
was white and clear against the dark background of spruces we were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew the family ghost only appears in daylight said the story girl
i know hell laugh at us awful but its better to be laughed at than scared like this uncle roger did not come until nearly ten never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in the lane
we ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as uncle roger alighted at the front door he stared at us in the moonlight
theres no use asking the meaning of this i suppose said uncle roger with the calm of despair ive gave up trying to fathom you young ones peter wheres the key what yarn have you been telling
uncle roger unlocked and flung open the front door as he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell like chimes
we had to wait until uncle roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation we thought he never would stop
and now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death we heard uncle roger chuckling all the way to the barn
i was so frightened i wouldnt mind if hed laugh once and have it done with it
i shall tell it too i dont care if the joke is as much on myself as any one a story is a story no matter who its on but it is hateful to be laughed at and grown ups always do it i never will when im grown up ill remember better
its all peters fault said felicity i do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing
it dont sound a bit like other clocks
i wouldnt have said the story girl honestly i thought it was a bell when i heard it and the door open too let us be fair felicity
but it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and felicity suggested that a saucerful apiece
elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend his visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction
while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect it was evident that he was unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring
but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one
he joined her and marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others were down and marianne who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could soon left them to themselves but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open
as you are not yet ready for breakfast
this was a subject which ensured mariannes attention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes
when edward interrupted her by saying you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars
which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country
the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber
i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel
and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own it is very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself
because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel
but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing
i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower
marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister
till a new object suddenly engaged her attention she was sitting by edward and in taking his tea from missus dashwood his hand passed so directly before her as to make a ring with a plait of hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers
but i should have thought her hair had been darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt but when she saw how much she had pained edward her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his
he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary glance at elinor replied yes it is my sisters hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
that the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as marianne the only difference in their conclusions was that what marianne considered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself
she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront and affecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt
that it was exactly the shade of her own edwards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled he was particularly grave the whole morning marianne severely censured herself for what she had said
before the middle of the day they were visited by sir john and missus jennings who having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey of the guest with the assistance of his mother in law sir john was not long in discovering
that the name of ferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung
but as it was she only learned from some very significant looks how far their penetration founded on margarets instructions extended sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening
on the present occasion for the better entertainment of their visitor towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute he wished to engage them for both you must drink tea with us to night said he
missus jennings enforced the necessity and who knows but you may raise a dance said she and that will tempt you miss marianne a dance cried marianne impossible who is to dance who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure
what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone i wish with all my soul cried sir john that willoughby were among us again this and mariannes blushing gave new suspicions to edward
and who is willoughby said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom he was sitting she gave him a brief reply
edward saw enough to comprehend not only the meaning of others but such of mariannes expressions as had puzzled him before and when their visitors left them he went immediately round her and said in a whisper i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
what do you mean shall i tell you certainly well then i guess that mister willoughby hunts marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moments silence said
hope i am sure you will like him
missus allen said catherine the next morning will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
catherine cheerfully complied and being properly equipped was more impatient than ever to be at the pump room that she might inform herself of general tilneys lodgings for though she believed they were in milsom street she was not certain of the house
and missus allens wavering convictions only made it more doubtful to milsom street she was directed and having made herself perfect in the number hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit explain her conduct and be forgiven
tripping lightly through the church yard and resolutely turning away her eyes that she might not be obliged to see her beloved isabella and her dear family who she had reason to believe were in a shop hard by she reached the house without any impediment looked at the number
and with a look which did not quite confirm his words said he had been mistaken for that miss tilney was walked out catherine with a blush of mortification left the house she felt almost persuaded that miss tilney was at home and too much offended to admit her
and as she retired down the street could not withhold one glance at the drawing room windows in expectation of seeing her there
at the bottom of the street however she looked back again and then not at a window but issuing from the door she saw miss tilney herself she was followed by a gentleman whom catherine believed to be her father and they turned up towards edgars buildings
catherine in deep mortification proceeded on her way she could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility but she checked the resentful sensation she remembered her own ignorance she knew not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness
to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her amenable dejected and humbled she had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night
for she soon recollected in the first place that she was without any excuse for staying at home and in the second
to the theatre accordingly they all went no tilneys appeared to plague or please her she feared that amongst the many perfections of the family a fondness for plays was not to be ranked but perhaps it was because they were habituated to the finer performances of the london stage
on the beginning of the fifth however the sudden view of mister henry tilney and his father joining a party in the opposite box recalled her to anxiety and distress the stage could no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep her whole attention
every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box and for the space of two entire scenes did she thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch his eye no longer could he be suspected of indifference for a play
his notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes
and forced him to hear her explanation feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her instead of considering her own dignity injured by this ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence
to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of it to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation and to enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight or flirting with somebody else she took to herself all the shame of misconduct
or at least of its appearance and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause the play concluded the curtain fell henry tilney was no longer to be seen where he had hitherto sat but his father remained
and perhaps he might be now coming round to their box she was right in a few minutes he appeared
you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it missus allen did not they tell me that mister tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you
my dear you tumble my gown was missus allens reply her assurance however standing sole as it did was not thrown away it brought a more cordial more natural smile into his countenance
and he replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mister thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now missus allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mister thorpe would only have stopped
i would have jumped out and run after you is there a henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration henry tilney at least was not with a yet sweeter smile he said everything that need be said of his sisters concern regret
and dependence on catherines honour oh do not say miss tilney was not angry cried catherine because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted
perhaps you did not know i had been there i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father
and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you
and meant to make her apology as soon as possible catherines mind was greatly eased by this information yet a something of solicitude remained from which sprang the following question thoroughly artless in itself though rather distressing to the gentleman but mister tilney
why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence me i take offence
nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry i angry i could have no right well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face he replied by asking her to make room for him and talking of the play he remained with them some time
and was only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when he went away before they parted however it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible and setting aside the misery of his quitting their box
she was upon the whole left one of the happiest creatures in the world while talking to each other
was engaged in conversation with general tilney
what could they have to say of her she feared general tilney did not like her appearance she found it was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter rather than postpone his own walk a few minutes how came mister thorpe to know your father was her anxious inquiry
as she pointed them out to her companion he knew nothing about it but his father like every military man
when the entertainment was over thorpe came to assist them in getting out catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry and while they waited in the lobby for a chair he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue by asking
in a consequential manner whether she had seen him talking with general tilney he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you
know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first
the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew
lowering his voice well done general said i i am quite of your mind
the queen was receivd at babylon with all the transports of joy that could possibly be expressd for the safe return of so illustrious and so beautiful a personage that had run thro such a long series of misfortunes
babylon at that time seemd to be perfectly serene and quiet as for the young prince of hyrcania he was slain in battle the babylonians who were the victors
who should gain it by a fair and impartial election they were determind that the most valuable post of honour in the world namely
and the sovereign of babylon should be the result of merit only and not be procurd by any party factions or court intrigues a solemn oath was voluntarily taken by all parties
that he who should distinguish himself by his superior valour and wisdom should unanimously be acknowledgd the sovereign elect a spacious list or circus was pitched upon surrounded with commodious seats
erected in an amphitheatrical manner and richly embellishd some few leagues from the city thither the combatants or champions were to repair compleatly accoutred each of them had a distinct apartment to himself behind the lists
where no soul could either see them or know who they were they were to enter the lists four several times those who were so happy as to conquer four competitors were afterwards to engage each other in single combat
in order that he who should remain master of the field should be proclaimd the happy victor four days afterwards they were to meet again accoutred as before
and to explain all such a enigmas or riddles as the magi should think proper to propose if their queries should prove too intricate and perplext for them to resolve they were to have recourse to the lists again and after that to fresh a enigmas
before they could be entitled to the election so that the tournaments were to be continud till one of the candidates should be twice a victor and shine as conspicuous with respect to his internal qualities as to his dexterity and address in heroic atchievements
the queen in the mean time was to be narrowly watchd and allowd only to be a spectator of both their amusements at some considerable distance and moreover to be coverd with a vail
nor was she indulgd so far as to speak one single word to any candidate whomsoever in order to prevent the least jealousy or suspicion either of partiality or injustice
to inform her lover of all the preliminary articles abovementiond not doubting but that he would exert both his courage and understanding for her sake beyond any of the other competitors zadig accordingly set out for babylon and besought the goddess venus
not only to fortify his courage but to illuminate his mind with wisdom on this important occasion the night before these martial atchievements were to commence zadig arrived upon the banks of the euphrates
he inscribd his device amongst the list of combatants concealing at the same time both his person and name as the laws of the election required and accordingly withdrew to the apartment that was provided for him
according to his lot cador who was just returnd to babylon having hunted all egypt over to no purpose in hopes to find his friend zadig brought a compleat set of armour into his lodge by express orders from the queen
she sent him likewise one of the finest horses in all persia
which redoubled his vigour and his hopes the next morning the queen being seated under a canopy of state enrichd with precious stones and the amphitheatres being crowded with gentlemen and ladies of all ranks and conditions from babylon
the competitors made their personal appearance in the circus each of them went up to the grand magus and laid down his particular device at his feet the devices were drawn by lot that of zadig was the last
one itabod by name immensely rich indeed and very haughty
exceedingly awkward and a man of no acquird parts the sycophants that hoverd round about him flatterd him that a man of his merit couldnt fail of being king he imperiously replied one of my merit must be king
his armour was made of pure gold enamelld with green the housings of his saddle were green and his lance embellishd with green ribbands every one was sensible at first sight
by itobads manner of managing his horse that he was not the man whom heavn had pitchd upon to sway the babylonish scepter the first combatant that tilted with him threw him out of the saddle the second flung him quite over the crupper
and laid him sprawling on the ground with his heels quivring in the air itobad tis true remounted but with so ill a grace
the third disdaining to use his lance made only a feint at him then catchd hold of his right leg and whirling him round threw him flat upon the sand the esquires who were the attendants ran to his assistance
and with a sneer remounted him the fourth combatant catchd hold of his left leg and unhorsd him again he was conveyd thro the hissing multitude to his lodge where according to the law in that case provided he was to pass the night
and as he hobbled along said he to the esquires what a sad misfortune is this to one of my birth and character the other champions playd their parts much better and all came off with credit
some conquerd two of their antagonists and others were so far successful as to get the better of three none of them however except prince hottam vanquishd four zadig at last
one after the other with the utmost ease and with such an air and grace as gaind him universal applause as the case stood thus zadig and hottam were to close the days entertainment in a single combat
the armour of the latter was of a blue colour mixt with gold and the housings of his saddle were of the same those of the former white as snow the multitude were divided in their wishes the knight in blue was the favourite of some of the ladies
the queen whose heart was in a perfect palpitation put up her secret prayers to venus to assist her darling hero the two champions making their passes and their voltas with the utmost dexterity and address
and keeping firm in their saddles gave each other such rebuffs with their lances that all the spectators the queen only excepted wishd for two kings of babylon at last their horses being tired and both their lances broke
zadig made use of the following stratagem
he got artfully behind him and shooting with a spring on his horses buttocks graspd him close threw him headlong on the sand then jumpd into his seat and wheeld round prince hottam while he lay sprawling on the ground all the spectators in general
with loud acclamations cried out victory victory in favour of the champion in white
incensd to the last degree got up and drew his sword zadig sprang from his horse with his sabre in his hand now behold the two chieftains upon their legs commencing a new trial of skill where they seemd to get the better of each other alternately
for both were strong and both were active the feathers of their helmets the studs of their bracelets their coats of mail flew about in pieces thro the dry blows which they a thousand times repeated they struck at each other sometimes with the edge of their swords
at other times they pushd as occasion offerd now on the right then on the left now on the head then at the breast they retreated they advancd they kept at a distance they closd again
their swords struck fire almost at every blow at last zadig in order to recover his breath for a moment or two stood still and afterwards making a feint at the prince threw him on his back and disarmd him hottam thereupon
cried out o thou knight of the white armour tis you only are destind to be the king of babylon the queen was perfectly transported the two champions were reconducted to their separate lodges as the others had been before them in conformity to the laws prescribd
several mutes were orderd to wait on the champions and carry them some proper refreshment well leave the reader to judge whether the queens dwarf was not appointed to wait on zadig on this happy occasion after supper the mutes withdrew
and left the combatants to rest their wearied limbs till the next morning at which time the victor was to produce his device before the grand magus in order to confer notes and discover the hero whoever he might be zadig slept very sound
notwithstanding his amorous regard for the queen being perfectly fatigud itabod who lay in the lodge contiguous to his could not once close his eyes for vexation he got up therefore in the dead of the night stole imperceptibly into zadigs apartment
took his white armour and device away with him and substituted his green one in its place as soon as the day began to dawn he repaird with a seemingly undaunted courage to the grand magus to inform him that he was the mighty hero the happy victor
and was proclaimd victor before zadig was awake
returnd with a heart overwhelmd with despair to the court of babylon
he was obligd tho sorely against his will to put it on having nothing else in his lodge to appear in confounded and big with resentment
the populace that were left behind in the circus hissd him every step he took they made a ring about him and treated him with all the marks of ignominy and contempt the most cowardly wretch breathing was never sure so sweated or hunted down as poor zadig
he grew quite out of patience at last and cut his way thro the insulting mob with his rivals sabre but he did not know what measures to pursue or how to rectify so gross a mistake it was not in his power to have a sight of the queen
he could never recover the white armour again which she had sent him that was the compromise or the engagement to which the combatants had all unanimously agreed thus as he was on the one hand plungd in an abyss of sorrow
so on the other he was almost drove distracted with vexation and resentment he withdrew therefore in a solitary mood to the banks of the euphrates now fully persuaded
that his impropitious star had shed its most baleful influence on him and that his misfortunes were irretrievable revolving in his mind all his disappointments from his first adventure with the court coquet
down to his late loss of his white armour see said he the fatal consequence of being a sluggard
all the knowledge of books or mankind all the personal valour that i can boast of has only provd an aggravation of my sorrows he carried the point so far at last as to murmur at the unequal dispensations of divine providence
and was tempted to believe that all occurrences were governd by a malignant destiny which never faild to oppress the virtuous and always crownd the actions of such villains as the green knight with uncommon success in one of his frantick fits
he put on the green armour that had created him such a world of disgrace a merchant happening to pass by he sold it to him for a trifle and took in exchange nothing more than a mantle and a cap
to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mister bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter
and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency
miss bingley was engrossed by mister darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mister hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man
who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room
she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa
six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me
certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles
said bingley i am afraid mister darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and missus hurst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl
and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily
it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made no answer
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations
and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant
that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it
and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mister hurst looked at her with astonishment do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mister darcy it ought to be good he replied
it has been the work of many generations
charles when you build your house
i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart
i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities charles upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller how i long to see her again i never met
with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingley
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley then
observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word
added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united
missus hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mister hurst called them to order
with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her
a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mister jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service
recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mister jones should be sent for early in the morning
if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgement of her situation
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with missus bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane
on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that missus bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected
indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mister jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her
oh yes i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens
it does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
but people themselves alter so much
offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment
turned silently away missus bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all
indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mister darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town
which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards mister darcy with a very expressive smile
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away
so much the man of fashion so genteel and easy he has always something to say to everybody that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important
and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies
for my part mister bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome
not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend
i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away
but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently
there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy
of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say
and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but missus bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal
the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mister bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield
lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits
and a sort of natural self consequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance
and abruptly reminded him of his promise
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball
but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied
and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
missus bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mister darcy the latter of whom however
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on
chapter five through solway sands through taross moss blindfold he knew the paths to cross by wily turns by desperate bounds had baffled percys best bloodhounds
in eske or liddel fords were none but he would ride them one by one alike to him was time or tide decembers snow or julys pride alike to him was tide or time moonless midnight or matin prime
walter scott all the members of the wharton family laid their heads on their pillows that night with a foreboding of some interruption to their ordinary quiet uneasiness kept the sisters from enjoying their usual repose
and they rose from their beds on the following morning unrefreshed and almost without having closed their eyes on taking an eager and hasty survey of the valley from the windows of their room nothing however but its usual serenity was to be seen
compose the season for enjoyment in the open air they have their storms but they are distinct and not of long continuance leaving a clear atmosphere and a cloudless sky
the sisters descended to the parlor with a returning confidence in their brothers security and their own happiness the family were early in assembling around the breakfast table and miss peyton with a little of that minute
had pleasantly insisted that the absence of her nephew should in no manner interfere with the regular hours she had established consequently the party were already seated when the captain made his appearance
though the untasted coffee sufficiently proved that by none of his relatives was his absence disregarded i think i did much better he cried taking a chair between his sisters and receiving their offered salutes
turning to his younger and evidently favorite sister and tapping her cheek did you see banners in the clouds and mistake miss peytons aeolian harp for rebellious music nay henry rejoined the maid
looking at him affectionately much as i love my own country the approach of her troops just now would give me great pain the brother made no reply but returning the fondness expressed in her eye by a look of fraternal tenderness
he gently pressed her hand in silence when caesar who had participated largely in the anxiety of the family and who had risen with the dawn and kept a vigilant watch on the surrounding objects as he stood gazing from one of the windows
run massa harry run
run repeated the british officer gathering himself up in military pride no mister caesar running is not my trade while speaking he walked deliberately to the window
where the family were already collected in the greatest consternation
his house was surrounded by a dozen sentinels two or three of the dragoons now dismounted and disappeared in a few minutes however they returned to the yard followed by katy from whose
violent gesticulations it was evident that matters of no trifling concern were on the carpet a short communication with the loquacious housekeeper followed the arrival of the main body of the troop and the advance party remounting
but they were all haughtily rejected by the young man as unworthy of his character it was too late to retreat to the woods in the rear of the cottage for he would unavoidably be seen and followed by a troop of horse as inevitably taken
at length his sisters with trembling hands replaced his original disguise the instruments of which had been carefully kept at hand by caesar in expectation of some sudden emergency
this arrangement was hastily and imperfectly completed as the dragoons entered the lawn and orchard of the locusts riding with the rapidity of the wind and in their turn the whartons were surrounded
nothing remained now but to meet the impending examination with as much indifference as the family could assume the leader of the horse dismounted and followed by a couple of his men he approached the outer door of the building
which was slowly and reluctantly opened for his admission by caesar the heavy tread of the trooper as he followed the black to the door of the parlor rang in the ears of the females as it approached nearer and nearer
and drove the blood from their faces to their hearts with a chill that nearly annihilated feeling a man whose colossal stature manifested the possession of vast strength entered the room and removing his cap
his appearance did not indicate as belonging to his nature his dark hair hung around his brow in profusion though stained with powder which was worn at that day and his face was nearly hid in the whiskers by which it was disfigured
still the expression of his eye though piercing was not bad and his voice though deep and powerful was far from unpleasant frances ventured to throw a timid glance at his figure as he entered
and saw at once the man from whose scrutiny harvey birch had warned them there was so much to be apprehended you have no cause for alarm ladies said the officer pausing a moment and contemplating the pale faces around him
my business will be confined to a few questions which if freely answered will instantly remove us from your dwelling and what may they be sir stammered mister wharton
rising from his chair and waiting anxiously for the reply has there been a strange gentleman staying with you during the storm continued the dragoon speaking with interest and in some degree sharing in the evident anxiety of the father
and has not yet departed this gentleman repeated the other turning to captain wharton and contemplating his figure for a moment
he approached the youth with an air of comic gravity and with a low bow continued i am sorry for the severe cold you have in your head sir i exclaimed the captain in surprise
i have no cold in my head i fancied it then from seeing you had covered such handsome black locks with that ugly old wig it was my mistake you will please to pardon it
mister wharton groaned aloud but the ladies ignorant of the extent of their visitors knowledge remained in trembling yet rigid silence the captain himself moved his hand involuntarily to his head
and discovered that the trepidation of his sisters had left some of his natural hair exposed the dragoon watched the movement with a continued smile when seeming to recollect himself turning to the father he proceeded
mister harper echoed the other feeling a load removed from his heart yes i had forgotten but he is gone and if there be anything wrong in his character we are in entire ignorance of it
to me he was a total stranger you have but little to apprehend from his character answered the dragoon dryly but he is gone how when and whither
his countenance gradually lighting into a smile of pleasure
he turned on his heel and left the apartment the whartons judging from his manner thought he was about to proceed in quest of the object of his inquiries they observed the dragoon on
gaining the lawn in earnest and apparently pleased conversation with his two subalterns in a few moments orders were given to some of the troops and horsemen left the valley at full speed by its various roads
the suspense of the party within who were all highly interested witnesses of this scene
some disorder had surely crept into the course of the elements destroying their benignant influence the wind prince of air raged through his kingdom lashing the sea into fury
and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience the god sends down his angry plagues from high famine and pestilence in heaps they die again in vengeance of his wrath he falls
on their great hosts and breaks their tottering walls arrests their navies on the oceans plain and whelms their strength with mountains of the main
their deadly power shook the flourishing countries of the south and during winter even we in our northern retreat began to quake under their ill effects
that fable is unjust which gives the superiority to the sun over the wind who has not seen the lightsome earth the balmy atmosphere and basking nature become dark cold
and ungenial when the sleeping wind has awoke in the east or when the dun clouds thickly veil the sky
until the dank earth refusing to imbibe the superabundant moisture it lies in pools on the surface when the torch of day seems like a meteor to be quenched
who has not seen the cloud stirring north arise the streaked blue appear and soon an opening made in the vapours in the eye of the wind through which the bright azure shines
the clouds become thin an arch is formed for ever rising upwards till the universal cope being unveiled the sun pours forth its rays re animated and fed by the breeze
then mighty art thou o wind to be throned above all
whether thou comest destroying from the east or pregnant with elementary life from the west thee the clouds obey the sun is subservient to thee the shoreless
ocean is thy slave thou sweepest over the earth and oaks the growth of centuries submit to thy viewless axe the snow drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the alps
the avalanche thunders down their vallies thou holdest the keys of the frost and canst first chain and then set free the streams under thy gentle governance the buds and leaves are born
they flourish nursed by thee why dost thou howl thus o wind by day and by night for four long months thy roarings have not ceased the shores of the sea are strewn with wrecks
the earth has shed her beauty in obedience to thy command the frail balloon dares no longer sail on the agitated air thy ministers the clouds deluge the land with rain
rivers forsake their banks the wild torrent tears up the mountain path plain and wood and verdant dell are despoiled of their loveliness
our very cities are wasted by thee alas what will become of us it seems as if the giant waves of ocean and vast arms of the sea were about to wrench the deep rooted island from its centre and cast it
a ruin and a wreck upon the fields of the atlantic what are we the inhabitants of this globe least among the many that people infinite space our minds embrace infinity
of our being is subject to merest accident day by day we are forced to believe this he whom a scratch has disorganized he who disappears from apparent life under the influence of the hostile agency at work around us
had the same powers as i i
in the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the creation wielders of the elements masters of life and death and we allege in excuse of this arrogance that though the individual is destroyed
man continues for ever thus losing our identity that of which we are chiefly conscious we glory in the continuity of our species and learn to regard death without terror
but when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents then indeed man shrinks into insignificance he feels his tenure of life insecure
his inheritance on earth cut off i remember after having witnessed the destructive effects of a fire i could not even behold a small one in a stove without a sensation of fear
the mounting flames had curled round the building as it fell and was destroyed they insinuated themselves into the substances about them
and the impediments to their progress yielded at their touch could we take integral parts of this power and not be subject to its operation could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast
and not fear its growth and maturity thus we began to feel with regard to many visaged death let loose on the chosen districts of our fair habitation
and above all with regard to the plague we feared the coming summer nations bordering on the already infected countries began to enter upon serious plans for the better keeping out of the enemy
we a commercial people were obliged to bring such schemes under consideration and the question of contagion became matter of earnest disquisition
that the plague was not what is commonly called contagious like the scarlet fever or extinct small pox was proved it was called an epidemic but the grand question
was still unsettled of how this epidemic was generated and increased if infection depended upon the air the air was subject to infection
has been brought by ships to one sea port town yet the very people who brought it there were incapable of communicating it in a town more fortunately situated but how are we to judge of airs
and pronounce in such a city plague will die unproductive in such another nature has provided for it a plentiful harvest
in the same way individuals may escape ninety nine times and receive the death blow at the hundredth because bodies are sometimes
these reflections made our legislators pause before they could decide on the laws to be put in force the evil was so wide spreading so violent and immedicable that no care no prevention could be judged superfluous
which even added a chance to our escape these were questions of prudence there was no immediate necessity for an earnest caution england was still secure france
germany italy and spain were interposed walls yet without a breach between us and the plague our vessels truly were the sport of winds and waves even as gulliver
brobdignagians but we on our stable abode could not be hurt in life or limb by these eruptions of nature we could not fear we did not yet a feeling of awe
a breathless sentiment of wonder a painful sense
degradation of humanity was introduced into every heart nature our mother and our friend had turned on us a brow of menace she shewed us plainly that though she permitted us to assign her laws and subdue her apparent powers
we must quake she could take our globe
and all that mans mind could invent or his force achieve she could take the ball in her hand and cast it into space where life would be drunk up and man and all his efforts for ever annihilated
these speculations were rife among us yet not the less we proceeded in our daily occupations and our plans whose accomplishment demanded the lapse of many years no voice was heard telling us to hold
when foreign distresses came to be felt by us through the channels of commerce we set ourselves to apply remedies subscriptions were made for the emigrants and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade
the english spirit awoke to its full activity and as it had ever done set itself to resist the evil and to stand in the breach which diseased nature had suffered chaos and death to make
in the bounds and banks which had hitherto kept them out at the commencement of summer we began to feel that the mischief which had taken place in distant countries was greater than we had at first suspected
quito was destroyed by an earthquake mexico laid waste by the united effects of storm pestilence and famine crowds of emigrants inundated the west of europe
and our island had become the refuge of thousands in the mean time
he had sought this office with eagerness under the idea of turning his whole forces to the suppression of the privileged orders of our community
at length forbade a recourse to the usual modes of relief trade was stopped by the failure of the interchange of cargoes usual between us and america india egypt and greece
in vain our protector and his partizans sought to conceal this truth in vain day after day he appointed a period for the discussion of the new laws concerning hereditary rank and privilege
in vain he endeavoured to represent the evil as partial and temporary these disasters came home to so many bosoms and through the various channels of commerce were carried so
entirely into every class and division of the community that of necessity they became the first question in the state the chief subjects to which we must turn our attention
can it be true each asked the other with wonder and dismay that whole countries are laid waste whole nations annihilated by these disorders in nature the vast cities of america the fertile plains of
hindostan the crowded abodes of the chinese are menaced with utter ruin where late the busy multitudes assembled for pleasure or profit
now only the sound of wailing and misery is heard the air is empoisoned and each human being inhales death even while in youth and health their hopes are in the flower
we called to mind the plague of thirteen forty eight when it was calculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed as yet western europe was uninfected would it always be so
o yes it would countrymen fear not in the still uncultivated wilds of america what wonder that among its other giant destroyers plague should be numbered
it would expire in these climes it drinks the dark blood of the inhabitant of the south but it never feasts on the pale faced celt if
perchance some stricken asiatic
plague dies with him uncommunicated and innoxious let us weep for our brethren though we can never experience their reverse
let us lament over and assist the children of the garden of the earth late we envied their abodes their spicy groves fertile plains and abundant loveliness but in this mortal life extremes are always matched
the thorn grows with the rose the poison tree and the cinnamon mingle their boughs
marble halls and infinite wealth is now a tomb the tent of the arab is fallen in the sands and his horse spurns the ground unbridled and unsaddled the voice of lamentation fills the valley of cashmere
its dells and woods its cool fountains and gardens of roses are polluted by the dead in circassia and georgia the spirit of beauty weeps over the ruin of its favourite temple the form of woman
our own distresses though they were occasioned by the fictitious reciprocity of commerce encreased in due proportion bankers merchants and manufacturers
whose trade depended on exports and interchange of wealth became bankrupt such things when they happen singly affect only the immediate parties but the prosperity of the nation was now shaken by frequent and extensive losses
families bred in opulence and luxury were reduced to beggary the very state of peace in which we gloried was injurious there were no means of employing the idle
even the source of colonies was dried up for in new holland
and the cape of good hope plague raged
and bring back the earth to its accustomed health
at the multitude of evils that gathered round us must he tax the landed interest to assist our commercial population to do this he must gain the favour of the chief land holders the nobility of the country
and these were his vowed enemies he must conciliate them by abandoning his favourite scheme of equalization he must confirm them
he must sell his cherished plans for the permanent good of his country for temporary relief he must aim no more at the dear object of his ambition
throwing his arms aside he must for present ends give up the ultimate object of his endeavours he came to windsor to consult with us every day added to his difficulties
the arrival of fresh vessels with emigrants the total cessation of commerce the starving multitude that thronged around the palace of the protectorate were circumstances not to be tampered with
the blow was struck the aristocracy obtained all they wished and they subscribed to a twelvemonths bill which levied twenty per cent on all the rent rolls of the country
calm was now restored to the metropolis and to the populous cities before driven to desperation and we returned to the consideration of distant calamities wondering if the future would bring any alleviation
to their excess it was august so there could be small hope of relief during the heats on the contrary
while starvation did its accustomed work thousands died unlamented for beside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched made mute by death
on the eighteenth of this month news arrived in london that the plague was in france and italy these tidings were at first whispered about town but no one dared express aloud the soul quailing intelligence
when any one met a friend in the street he only cried as he hurried on you know while the other with an ejaculation of fear and horror would answer
what will become of us at length it was mentioned in the newspapers the paragraph was inserted in an obscure part we regret to state
that there can be no longer a doubt of the plague having been introduced at leghorn genoa and marseilles no word of comment followed
we were as a man who hears that his house is burning and yet hurries through the streets borne along by a lurking hope of a mistake
and sees his sheltering roof enveloped in a flame before it had been a rumour but now in words uneraseable in definite and undeniable print the knowledge went forth
its obscurity of situation rendered it the more conspicuous the diminutive letters grew gigantic to the bewildered eye of fear they seemed graven
with a pen of iron impressed by fire woven in the clouds stamped on the very front of the universe the english
whether travellers or residents came pouring in one great revulsive stream back on their own country and with them crowds of italians and spaniards
our little island was filled even to bursting at first an unusual quantity of specie made its appearance with the emigrants but these people had no means of receiving back into their hands what they spent among us
rents were unpaid and their remittances failed them it was impossible to see these crowds of wretched perishing creatures late nurslings of luxury
and not stretch out a hand to save them as at the conclusion of the eighteenth century the english unlocked their hospitable store for the relief of those driven from their homes by political revolution
so now they were not backward in affording aid to the victims of a more wide spreading calamity we had many foreign friends whom we eagerly sought out and relieved from dreadful penury
our castle became an asylum for the unhappy a little population occupied its halls the revenue of its possessor which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature
was now attended to more parsimoniously that it might embrace a wider portion of utility it was not however money except partially but the necessaries of life
that became scarce it was difficult to find an immediate remedy the usual one of imports was entirely cut off in this emergency to feed the very people to whom we had given refuge we were obliged to yield to the plough
our pleasure grounds and parks live stock diminished sensibly in the country from the effects of the great demand in the market even the poor deer our antlered proteges
were obliged to fall for the sake of worthier pensioners the labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories
adrian did not rest only with the exertions he could make with regard to his own possessions he addressed himself to the wealthy of the land he made proposals in parliament little adapted to please the rich
earnest pleadings and benevolent eloquence were irresistible to give up their pleasure grounds to the agriculturist to diminish sensibly the number of horses kept for the purposes of luxury throughout the country
yet to the honour of the english be it recorded that although natural
made them delay awhile yet when the misery of their fellow creatures became glaring an enthusiastic generosity inspired their decrees
the most luxurious were often the first to part with their indulgencies as is common in communities a fashion was set the high born ladies of the country would have deemed themselves disgraced
if they had now enjoyed what they before called a necessary the ease of a carriage chairs as in olden time and indian palanquins were introduced for the infirm
but else it was nothing singular to see females of rank going on foot to places of fashionable resort it was more common for all who possessed landed property to secede to their estates
attended by whole troops of the indigent to cut down their woods to erect temporary dwellings and to portion out their parks parterres and flower gardens
to necessitous families many of these of high rank in their own countries now with hoe in hand turned up the soil it was found necessary at last
to check the spirit of sacrifice and to remind those whose generosity proceeded to lavish waste that until the present state of things became permanent of which there was no likelihood
so far as to make a reaction difficult experience demonstrated that in a year or two pestilence would cease it were well that in the mean time
we should not have destroyed our fine breeds of horses or have utterly changed the face of the ornamented portion of the country
the infection had now spread in the southern provinces of france but that country had so many resources in the way of agriculture
and its increase through foreign emigration was less felt than with us the panic struck appeared of more injury than disease and its natural
concomitants winter was hailed a general and never failing physician
were welcomed with gratitude the effects of purifying cold were immediately felt and the lists of mortality abroad were
many of our visitors left us those whose homes were far in the south fled delightedly from our northern winter and sought their native land secure of plenty even after their fearful
visitation we breathed again
what were they disputing then said emily no maamselle nor fighting but almost as good for i believe there was not one of the signors sober
and what is more not one of those fine ladies sober either i thought when i saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils why maamselle their veils were worked with silver
and fine trimmings boded no good i guessed what they were good god exclaimed emily what will become of me
if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken signors
and across the great hall and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle and i am in the corridor in a minute are you so says he and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way
well says i if you think there is danger then go with me and guard me i am never afraid when you are by what says he when i am scarcely recovered of one wound shall i put myself in the way of getting another
no no says he i will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle for you shall stay here annette you shall not go out of this room to night so
well well said emily impatiently and anxious to enquire on another subject
yes he did indeed maamselle notwithstanding all i could say to the contrary
and he mistook ludovicos hall for old carlos
so we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the signor was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door
come forth my valorous signor steward just then old carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the signor saw him
he was as tame as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket all this i saw through the key hole well annette said ludovico jeeringly shall i let you out now
interrupted emily quite wearied by this story do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice
but it is expected back to night or to morrow and i shall know then perhaps emily enquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners ah maamselle said annette archly
now i dare say you are thinking of monsieur valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of our people and is taken captive
o lord how glad i should be if it was so would you indeed be glad said emily in a tone of mournful reproach to be sure i should
maam replied annette and would not you be glad too to see signor valancourt i dont know any chevalier i like better i have a very great regard for the signor truly
your regard for him cannot be doubted said emily since you wish to see him a prisoner why no maamselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know and it was only the other night i dreamt
and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up again as fast as they could you would not believe maamselle though i shewed you the very cannon where it used to appear
and are you indeed so simple annette said emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories credit them maamselle why
all the world could not persuade me out of them roberto and sebastian and half a dozen more of them went into fits to be sure there was no occasion for that i said myself there was no need of that
for says i when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row the enemy wont be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up
but will fall to cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men no no says i there is reason in all things
being because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious weakness of annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied
nay maamselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret this was a hard
but i dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have maam emily looked displeased and made no reply as she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself
opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to believe it was valancourt whom she had seen yet if it was he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle
and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart
were the same or if they were whether this was valancourt she however desired that annette would endeavour to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names o dear maamselle said annette i forget to tell you what you bade me ask about
the ladies as they call themselves who are lately come to udolpho why that signora livona that the signor brought to see my late lady at venice is his mistress now and was little better then i dare say and ludovico says
but pray be secret maam that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character so when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal
but i thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor ladys death too
but she cannot hear them now poor soul said i emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired annette to go and make enquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle
but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of monsieur valancourt now i think of it maamselle said annette i do believe there are prisoners for i overheard one of the signors men yesterday
and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellenza to catch up men and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms
because said he we dont go shares there this information heightened emilys impatience to know more and annette immediately departed on her enquiry the late resolution of emily to resign her estates to montoni now gave way to new considerations
the possibility that valancourt was near her revived her fortitude and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle she was in this temper of mind when she received a message from montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlour
which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of valancourt montoni was alone i sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions
i will condescend to advise where i may command
if i have no right in these estates sir said emily of what service can it be to you that i should sign any papers concerning them if the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent
i will have no more argument said montoni with a look that made her tremble what had i but trouble to expect when i condescended to reason with a baby but i will be trifled with no longer
let the recollection of your aunts sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson sign the papers emilys resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived
and from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always
from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent courage sign the papers said montoni more impatiently than before never sir
replied emily that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had i even been ignorant of my right montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech
then all my vengeance falls upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath and think not it shall be delayed
you have dared to question my right now dare to question my power i have a punishment which you think not of it is terrible this night this very night this
night repeated another voice montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself he proceeded in a lower tone you have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly
yet this it appears has not been sufficient to deter you
i could make you tremble at the bare recital he was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes
yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but montoni paused scarcely an instant and commanding his features
resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice i say i could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me
i could tell you that when once my resolution is taken but i am talking to a baby let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples i could recite the recital could not now benefit you
for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition it would not now appease my indignation i will have vengeance as well as justice another groan filled the pause which montoni made
leave the room instantly said he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence without power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair
quit my presence cried montoni this affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation did you hear nothing signor said emily trembling and still unable to leave the room
i heard my own voice rejoined montoni sternly and nothing else
obey my order repeated montoni and for these fools tricks i will soon discover by whom they are practised emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while montoni followed her
but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence passed to the ramparts as in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement emily saw a party of montonis troops winding down a distant mountain
whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle at length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation
on this particular evening he dined at rectors a restaurant of some local fame which occupied a basement at clark and monroe streets thereafter he visited the resort of fitzgerald and moys in adams street opposite the imposing federal building
there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars one of which he lighted this to him represented in part high life a fair sample of what the whole must be
drouet was not a drinker in excess he was not a moneyed man he only craved the best as his mind conceived it and such doings seemed to him a part of the best
rectors with its polished marble walls and floor its profusion of lights its show of china and silverware and above all its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go
he loved fine clothes good eating and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men when dining it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was wont to come to this same place
or that henry e dixie a well known performer of the day was then only a few tables off at rectors he could always obtain this satisfaction for there one could encounter politicians brokers actors
some rich young rounders of the town all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation thats so and so over there was a common remark of these gentlemen among themselves
particularly among those who had not yet reached but hoped to do so the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented you dont say so would be the reply why
why hes manager of the grand opera house when these things would fall upon drouets ears he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort if he had any vanity this augmented it
the floors were of brightly coloured tiles the walls a composition of rich dark polished wood which reflected the light and coloured stucco work which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance
the long bar was a blaze of lights polished wood work coloured and cut glassware and many fancy bottles
with rich screens fancy wines and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country at rectors drouet had met mister g w hurstwood manager of fitzgerald and moys
he had been pointed out as a very successful and well known man about town hurstwood looked the part for besides being slightly under forty he had a good stout constitution an active manner and a solid substantial air
which was composed in part of his fine clothes his clean linen his jewels and above all his own sense of his importance drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing
and was glad not only to meet him but to visit the adams street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind he was shrewd and clever in many little things
and capable of creating a good impression his managerial position was fairly important a kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control he had risen by perseverance and industry
the chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the owners
and upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in for the most part he lounged about dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods a solitaire ring a fine blue diamond in his tie a striking vest of some new pattern
and a watch chain of solid gold which held a charm of rich design and a watch of the latest make and engraving he knew by name and could greet personally with a well old fellow
hundreds of actors merchants politicians and the general run of successful characters about town and it was part of his success to do so he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship which improved from the how do you do
who by long frequenting of the place became aware of his position to the why old man how are you which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly there was a class however
too rich too famous or too successful with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address and with these he was professionally tactful assuming a grave and dignified attitude paying them the deference which would win their good feeling
without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions there were in the last place a few good followers neither rich nor poor famous nor yet remarkably successful with whom he was friendly on the score of good fellowship
these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously
to go to the races the theatres the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs he kept a horse and neat trap had his wife and two children who were well established in a neat house on the north side near lincoln park
and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper class the first grade below the luxuriously rich
the latters genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him he knew that drouet was only a travelling salesman and not one of many years at that but the firm of bartlett caryoe and company
hurstwood knew caryoe quite well having drunk a glass now and then with him in company with several others when the conversation was general
a moderate sense of humour and could tell a good story when the occasion required he could talk races with hurstwood
and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited and so managed to make himself almost invariably agreeable to night he was particularly so since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon
his new samples had been satisfactorily selected and his trip marked out for the next six weeks why hello charlie old man
how goes it the room was crowded drouet shook hands beaming good nature and they strolled towards the bar oh all right i havent seen you in six weeks when did you get in
friday said drouet had a fine trip glad of it said hurstwood his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make believe that usually dwelt in them what are you going to take he added as the barkeeper in snowy jacket and tie
leaned toward them from behind the bar old pepper said drouet a little of the same for me put in hurstwood how long are you in town this time inquired hurstwood only until wednesday im going up to saint paul
george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week yes i saw george returned drouet great old boy isnt he we had quite a time there together
as was considered proper and hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer whats become of caryoe remarked hurstwood i havent seen him around here in two weeks
barely comes down to the office now just one boy hasnt he asked hurstwood yes and a swift pacer laughed drouet i
no he cant injure that any i guess hurstwood was standing his coat open his thumbs in his pockets the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness he was the picture of fastidious comfort
to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind such a bubbling chattering glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly a strange commentary on nature and life
here come the moths in endless procession to bask in the light of the flame such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds
it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities where the sharp eared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst
nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatter here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires
the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved
the company the glow the atmosphere which they found one might take it after all as an augur of the better social order for the things which they satisfied here though sensory were not evil
no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the material minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis
in the last analysis that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind that such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed
could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of liquor
and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber
the dressy greedy company the small self interested palaver the disorganized aimless wandering mental action which it represents the love of light and show and finery which to one outside
under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing under the stars and sweeping night winds what a lamp flower it must bloom a
insect infested rose of pleasure see that fellow coming in there said hurstwood glancing at a gentleman just entering arrayed in a high hat and prince albert coat his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating
no where said drouet
said hurstwood indicating the direction by a cast of his eye the man with the silk hat oh yes said drouet now affecting not to see who is he thats jules wallace the spiritualist
drouet followed him with his eyes much interested doesnt look much like a man who sees spirits does he said drouet oh i
returned hurstwood hes got the money all right and a little twinkle passed over his eyes i dont go much on those things do you
well you never can tell said hurstwood there may be something to it i wouldnt bother about it myself though by the way he added are you going anywhere to night the hole in the ground
said drouet mentioning the popular farce of the time well youd better be going its half after eight already and he drew out his watch the crowd was already thinning out considerably
some bound for the theatres some to their clubs and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasures for the type of man there represented at least the ladies yes i will said drouet
come around after the show i have something i want to show you said hurstwood sure said drouet elated you havent anything on hand for the night have you added hurstwood not a thing well come round then
i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday remarked drouet by way of parting by george thats so i must go and call on her before i go away oh never mind her hurstwood remarked
say she was a little dandy i tell you
twelve oclock said hurstwood thats right
then up got little john and taking the bag of gold which he thrust into his bosom
and on the other as well little john knew to the merry blue boar inn here little john suddenly ceased whistling and stopped in the middle of the path first he looked up and then he looked down and then tilting his cap over one eye he slowly scratched the back part of his head for thus it was
at the sight of these two roads two voices began to alarum within him the one crying there lies the road to the blue boar inn a can of brown october and a merry night with sweet companions such as thou mayst find there the other
looking up into the blue sky across which bright clouds were sailing like silver boats and swallows skimming in circling flight quoth he
for i know my good master would not have me wet to the skin so without more ado off he strode down the path that lay the way of his likings now there was no sign of any foul weather but
fresh cans of ale were brought and with jest and song and merry tales the hours slipped away on fleeting wings none thought of time or tide till the night was so far gone that little john put by the thought of setting forth upon his journey again that night and so
bided at the blue boar inn until the morrow now it was an ill piece of luck for little john that he left his duty for his pleasure and he paid a great score for it as we are all apt to do in the same case as you shall see
and taking his stout pikestaff in his hand he set forth upon his journey once more as though he would make up for lost time in the good town of blyth there lived a stout tanner celebrated far and near for feats of strength and many tough bouts at wrestling and the quarterstaff
besides all this he dearly loved the longbow
so that the kings rangers kept a shrewd eye upon him and his doings for arthur a blands house was apt to have aplenty of meat in it that was more like venison than the law allowed now arthur had been to nottingham town the day before little john set forth on his errand
there to sell a halfscore of tanned cowhides at the dawn of the same day that little john left the inn he started from nottingham homeward for blyth his way led all in the dewy morn past the verge of sherwood forest where the birds were welcoming the lovely day with a great and merry jubilee
across the tanners shoulders was slung his stout quarterstaff ever near enough to him to be gripped quickly and on his head was a cap of doubled cowhide so tough that it could hardly be cloven even by a broadsword now quoth arthur a bland to himself
mayhap i may chance to catch a sight of the dainty brown darlings thus early in the morn for there was nothing he loved better than to look upon a tripping herd of deer
accordingly quitting the path he went peeping this way and that through the underbrush spying now here and now there with all the wiles of a master of woodcraft and of one who had more than once donned a doublet of lincoln green
that springing from the dewy grass hung aloft on quivering wings in the yellow sunlight pouring forth its song that fell like a falling star from the sky his luck led him away from the highway not far from the spot where arthur a bland was peeping this way and that through the leaves of the thickets
hearing a rustling of the branches little john stopped and presently caught sight of the brown cowhide cap of the tanner moving among the bushes i do much wonder
quoth little john to himself what yon knave is after that he should go thus peeping and peering about i verily believe that yon scurvy varlet is no better than a thief and cometh here after our own and the good kings dun deer for
by much roving in the forest little john had come to look upon all the deer in sherwood as belonging to robin hood and his band as much as to good king harry nay
little john trod upon a stick which snapped under his foot whereupon hearing the noise the tanner turned quickly and caught sight of the yeoman seeing that the tanner had spied him out little john put a bold face upon the matter
but an honest craftsman as for my countenance it is what it is and for the matter of that thine own is none too pretty thou saucy fellow ha quoth little john in a great loud voice wouldst thou give me backtalk
i and my friends do take good care of our good sovereigns deer i care not who thou art answered the bold tanner and unless thou hast many more of thy kind by thee thou canst never make arthur a bland cry a mercy
for i will give thee such a drubbing as neer hast thou had in all thy life before take thy staff in thy hand fellow for i will not smite an unarmed man
for he too had talked himself into a fume big words neer killed so much as a mouse who art thou that talkest so freely of cracking the head of arthur a bland if i do not tan thy hide this day as neer i tanned a calfs hide in all my life before
nay i pass not for length answered the tanner my staff is long enough to knock down a calf so look to thyself fellow i say again so without more ado each gripped his staff in the middle and with fell and angry looks they came slowly together
now news had been brought to robin hood how that little john instead of doing his bidding had passed by duty for pleasure and so had stopped overnight with merry company at the blue boar inn instead of going straight to ancaster
so being vexed to his heart by this he set forth at dawn of day to seek little john at the blue boar or at least to meet the yeoman on the way and ease his heart of what he thought of the matter
as thus he strode along in anger putting together the words he would use to chide little john he heard of a sudden loud and angry voices
at this robin hood stopped and listened surely quoth he to himself that is little johns voice and he is talking in anger also methinks the other is strange to my ears
now heaven forfend that my good trusty little john should have fallen into the hands of the kings rangers i must see to this matter and that quickly thus spoke robin hood to himself all his anger passing away like a breath from the windowpane
at the thought that perhaps his trusty right hand man was in some danger of his life so cautiously
ha quoth robin to himself here is merry sport afoot now i would give three golden angels from my own pocket if yon stout fellow would give little john a right sound drubbing it would please me to see him well thumped for having failed in my bidding
i fear me though there is but poor chance of my seeing such a pleasant sight so saying he stretched himself at length upon the ground that he might not only see the sport the better but that he might enjoy the merry sight at his ease
each watching for a chance to take the other unaware and so get in the first blow at last little john struck like a flash and rap the tanner met the blow and turned it aside and then smote back at little john who also turned the blow and so this mighty battle began
never had i thought to see little john so evenly matched in all my life belike though
his cudgel flying from his hand as he fell then raising his staff stout arthur dealt him another blow upon the ribs hold roared little john
hast thou had enough asked the tanner grimly holding his staff aloft ay marry and more than enough and thou dost own that i am the better man of the two yea truly and a murrain seize thee
said little john sitting up and feeling his ribs where the tanner had cudgeled him i make my vow my ribs feel as though every one of them were broken in twain
i did think there was never a man in all nottinghamshire could do to me what thou hast done this day and so thought i also cried robin hood bursting out of the thicket and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks
hand and foot to any man in all merry england i was seeking thee to chide thee for leaving my bidding undone but thou hast been paid all i owed thee
marry a did reach out his arm full length while thou stood gaping at him and with a pretty rap tumbled thee over as never have i seen one tumbled before so spoke bold robin
and now what may be thy name ha arthur a bland quoth robin i have heard thy name before good fellow thou didst break the crown of a friend of mine at the fair at ely last october the folk there call him jock o nottingham we call him will scathelock
this poor fellow whom thou hast so belabored is counted the best hand at the quarterstaff in all merry england his name is little john and mine robin hood
nay quoth little john testily at the same time rising carefully as though his bones had been made of glass i can help myself good fellow without thy aid and let me tell thee had it not been for that vile cowskin cap of thine
i will follow thee to the ends of the earth good master and not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the twang of my bowstring as for thee little john said robin turning to him and laughing
there are other inns that thou knowest yet hereabouts
happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight don quixote of la mancha was sent into the world
but also of the tales and episodes contained in it which are in a measure no less pleasing ingenious and truthful than the history itself which resuming its thread carded spun and wound relates that just as the curate was going to offer consolation to cardenio
all this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him and as it seemed to them to be uttered close by as indeed it was they got up to look for the speaker and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock seated at the foot of an ash tree
a youth in the dress of a peasant whose face they were unable at the moment to see as he was leaning forward bathing his feet in the brook that flowed past they approached so silently that he did not perceive them being fully occupied in bathing his feet
crush clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owners dress suggested and so finding they had not been noticed the curate who was in front made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay there
which they did observing closely what the youth was about he had on a loose double skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth and on his head a brown montera and
as this is not luscinda it is no human creature but a divine being the youth then took off the montera and shaking his head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of the sun might have envied
by this they knew that what had seemed a peasant was a lovely woman nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had ever beheld or even cardenios if they had not seen and known luscinda
the long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders but such was their length and abundance concealed her all round beneath their masses so that except the feet nothing of her form was visible she now used her hands as a comb
and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystal in the water her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders but their anxiety to learn who she was with this object they resolved to show themselves
her delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones seeing which the three hastened towards her and the curate addressing her first said stay senora whoever you may be for those whom you see here only desire to be of service to you
you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless for neither can your feet bear it nor we allow it taken by surprise and bewildered she made no reply to these words they however came towards her and the curate taking her hand went on to say
what your dress would hide senora is made known to us by your hair a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so unworthy of it and sent it into solitudes like these where we have had the good fortune to find you
if not to relieve your distress at least to offer you comfort for no distress so long as life lasts can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention and so senora
but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to her sighing deeply she broke silence and said since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods
it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of what if you were to believe me you would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason
this being so i say i thank you sirs for the offer you have made me which places me under the obligation of complying with the request you have made of me though i fear the account i shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as compassion
for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them however that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds now that you have discovered me to be a woman
i feel bound to tell what i would willingly keep secret if i could all this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty
and as they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise she without further pressing first modestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her and
after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes in a clear and steady voice began her story thus
lowly in origin but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as much on them as fortune they would have had nothing left to desire nor should i have had reason to fear trouble like that in which i find myself now
for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been nobly born it is true they are not so low that they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition
they are in short peasants
and as the saying is old rusty christians but so rich that by their wealth and free handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth and even by position
and as they have no other child to make their heir and are affectionate parents i was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents indulged
all their wishes centred and mine were in accordance with theirs for i knew their worth and as i was mistress of their hearts so was i also of their possessions through me they engaged or dismissed their servants
through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped the oil mills the wine presses the count of the flocks and herds the beehives all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have i had under my care
for experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit such was the life i led in my parents house and if i have depicted it thus minutely it is not out of ostentation or to let you know that i am rich but
and unseen as i thought by any except the servants of the house for when i went to mass it was so early in the morning and i was so closely attended by my mother and the women of the household and
for that is the name of the younger son of the duke i told of the moment the speaker mentioned the name of don fernando
for he began to suspect who she was she however without noticing the excitement of cardenio continuing her story went on to say
and i was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters for however ugly we women may be it seems to me it always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful but that my own sense of right was opposed to all this
as well as the repeated advice of my parents who now very plainly perceived don fernandos purpose for he cared very little if all the world knew it they told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to my virtue
and rectitude alone and bade me consider the disparity between don fernando and myself from which i might conclude that his intentions whatever he might say to the contrary had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage
and if i were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonable suit they were ready they said to marry me at once to anyone i preferred either among the leading people of our own town or
and i never gave don fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success however remote all this caution of mine which he must have taken for coyness had apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite for
or at least to secure additional protectors to watch over me and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you shall hear one night as i was in my chamber with no other companion than a damsel who waited on me with
i had no power to utter a cry nor i think did he give me time to utter one as he immediately approached me and taking me in his arms for overwhelmed as i was i was powerless i say to help myself he began to make such
professions to me that i know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth and the traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words and his sighs for his sincerity
and i began in some degree to recover myself i said to him with more courage than i thought i could have possessed
i have my self respect as much as you a lord and gentleman with me your violence will be to no purpose your wealth will have no weight your words will have no power to deceive me nor your sighs or tears to soften me
were i to see any of the things i speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband his will should be mine and mine should be bounded by his and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were not
and this i say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me if that
be the only scruple you feel fairest dorothea for that is the name of this unhappy being see here i give you my hand to be yours and let heaven
but he was unwilling to interrupt the story and wished to hear the end of what he already all but knew so he merely said what
i have heard of another of the same name who can perhaps match your misfortunes but proceed by and by i may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion dorothea was struck by cardenios words as well as by his strange and miserable attire
and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to tell it to her at once for if fortune had left her any blessing it was courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her as she felt sure that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she endured already
i would not let the occasion pass senora replied cardenio of telling you what i think
and one of his vassals i told him not to let my beauty such as it was blind him
for marriages so unequal never brought happiness nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with all this that i have now repeated i said to him and much more which i cannot recollect but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his purpose
at the same time i argued the matter briefly in my own mind saying to myself i shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station nor will don fernando be the first whom beauty or as is more likely a blind attachment
has led to mate himself below his rank then since i am introducing no new usage or practice
passed through my mind in a moment but the oaths of don fernando the witnesses he appealed to the tears he shed and lastly the charms of his person and his high bred grace which accompanied by such signs of genuine love
these were the things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin i called my waiting maid to me that there might be a witness on earth besides those in heaven and again don fernando renewed and repeated his oaths
called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his promise shed more tears redoubled his sighs
and so i was left by my maid and ceased to be one and he became a traitor and a perjured man the day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly i imagine as don fernando wished
who was indeed the one who had admitted him gained the street before daybreak but on taking leave of me he told me though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came that i might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths
and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine he then took his departure and i was left i know not whether sorrowful or happy all i can say is i was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place
and i had not the spirit or else it did not occur to me to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in concealing don fernando in my chamber for as yet i was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil
i told don fernando at parting that as i was now his he might see me on other nights in the same way until it should be his pleasure to let the matter become known but except the following night he came no more nor for more than a month could i catch a glimpse of him in the street or in church
while i wearied myself with watching for one
i remember too how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before and how i was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance not to give my parents cause to ask me why i was so melancholy
and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply but all this was suddenly brought to an end for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded and there was no further question of honour when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad
it was said too that her name was luscinda and that at the betrothal some strange things had happened
dorothea however did not interrupt her story but went on in these words this sad intelligence reached my ears
and whom i entreated to accompany me to the city where i heard my enemy was
an affair of such notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the street he said that on the night of don fernandos betrothal with luscinda as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying yes she was taken with a sudden fainting fit
and that on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air
on seeing this don fernando persuaded that luscinda had befooled slighted and trifled with him assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been found and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who were present prevented him
it was said moreover that don fernando went away at once and that luscinda did not recover from her prostration until the next day when she told her parents how she was really the bride of that cardenio i have mentioned i learned besides that cardenio
according to report had been present at the betrothal and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation he had quitted the city in despair leaving behind him a letter declaring the wrong luscinda had done him and his intention of going where no one should ever see him again
all this was a matter of notoriety in the city and everyone spoke of it especially when it became known that luscinda was missing from her fathers house and from the city for she was not to be found anywhere to the distraction of her parents who knew not what steps to take to recover her what i learned
revived my hopes and i was better pleased not to have found don fernando than to find him married for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case and i thought that perhaps heaven had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage
to lead him to recognise his obligations under the former one and reflect that as a christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects all this passed through my mind and i strove to comfort myself without comfort
indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life that i now abhor but while i was in the city uncertain what to do as i could not find don fernando i heard notice given by the public crier offering a great reward to anyone who should find me
and giving the particulars of my age and of the very dress i wore and i heard it said that the lad who came with me had taken me away from my fathers house a thing that cut me to the heart showing how low my good name had fallen since it was not enough that i should lose it by my flight
but they must add with whom i had fled and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my consideration the instant i heard the notice i quitted the city with my servant who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me and the same night for fear of discovery
he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first and began to use violence but just heaven that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion
i pushed him over a precipice where i left him whether dead or alive i know not and then with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror and fatigue i made my way into the mountains without any other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them and escaping my father
and those despatched in search of me by his orders it is now i know not how many months since with this object i came here where i met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this sierra
but all my care and pains were unavailing for my master made the discovery that i was not a man and harboured the same base designs as my servant
kletke there was once upon a time a man and woman who had three fine looking sons but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for themselves let alone their children
of her and their father the three set forth on their travels the youngest of the three brothers whose name was ferko was a beautiful youth with a splendid figure blue eyes fair hair
and a complexion like milk and roses his two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more fortunate than they would ever be
for the sun was hot and they were tired of walking ferko fell fast asleep but the other two remained awake and the eldest said to the second brother what do you say to doing our brother ferko some harm
he is so beautiful that everyone takes a fancy to him which is more than they do to us if we could only get him out of the way we might succeed better i quite agree with you answered the second brother
and my advice is to eat up his loaf of bread and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs his eldest brother was delighted with this proposal
and the two wicked wretches seized ferkos loaf and ate it all up while the poor boy was still asleep when he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread but his brothers cried out
you ate your loaf in your sleep you glutton and you may starve as long as you like but you wont get a scrap of ours ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep but he said nothing
and fasted all that day and the next night but on the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears and implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread
and break one of your legs then we will give you a bit of our bread at these words poor ferko wept more bitterly than before and bore the torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens
then he could stand it no longer and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out and his left leg to be broken when this was done he stretched out his hand eagerly for the piece of bread
but his brothers gave him such a tiny scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them for a second bit but the more ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger
the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed so he endured the pangs of starvation all that day but when night came his endurance gave way and he let his right eye be put out
and his right leg broken for a second piece of bread after his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for life they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey without him
poor ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly but no one heard him or came to his help night came on and the poor blind youth had no eyes to close
and could only crawl along the ground not knowing in the least where he was going but when the sun was once more high in the heavens ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him
and sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs he climbed to the top of a hill and lay down in the grass and as he thought under the shadow of a big tree
is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable about this neighbourhood i should just think there was replied the other many things that dont exist anywhere else in the world
there is a lake down there below us and anyone who bathes in it though he were at deaths door becomes sound and well on the spot and those who wash their eyes with the dew on this hill
become as sharp sighted as the eagle even if they have been blind from their youth well answered the first raven my eyes are in no want of this healing bath for heaven be praised
they are as good as ever they were but my wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many years ago so let us fly at once to the lake that i may be restored to health and strength again
and so they flew away their words rejoiced ferkos heart and he waited impatiently till evening should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes
at last it began to grow dusk and the sun sank behind the mountains gradually it became cooler on the hill and the grass grew wet with dew then ferko buried his face in the ground
till his eyes were damp with dewdrops and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life before the moon was shining brightly and lighted him to the lake where he could bathe his poor broken legs
then ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the water no sooner had he done so
he had not gone far before he met a wolf who was limping disconsolately along on three legs and who on perceiving ferko began to howl dismally my good friend said the youth
be of good cheer for i can soon heal your leg and with these words he poured some of the precious water over the wolfs paw and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and well on all fours
the grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly and promised ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field
here he noticed a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws for its front paws had both been broken in a trap ferko felt so sorry for the little beast
that he spoke to it in the most friendly manner and washed its small paws with the healing water in a moment the mouse was sound and whole and after thanking the kind physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows
ferko again proceeded on his journey but he hadnt gone far before a queen bee flew against him trailing one wing behind her which had been cruelly torn in two by a big bird
ferko was no less willing to help her than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse so he poured some healing drops over the wounded wing on the spot the queen bee was cured and turning to ferko she said
i am most grateful for your kindness and shall reward you some day and with these words she flew away humming gaily then ferko wandered on for many a long day
and at length reached a strange kingdom here he thought to himself he might as well go straight to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country for he had heard that the kings daughter
they had managed to obtain places in the kings service and when they recognised ferko with his eyes and legs sound and well they were frightened to death for they feared he would tell the king of their conduct
for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before his brothers noticed this and envy and jealousy were added to their fear so much so that they determined once more to destroy him
they went to the king and told him that ferko was a wicked magician who had come to the palace with the intention of carrying off the princess then the king had ferko brought before him and said
you are accused of being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter and i condemn you to death but if you can fulfil three tasks which i shall set you to do your life shall be spared
on condition you leave the country but if you cannot perform what i demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree and turning to the two wicked brothers he said suggest something for him to do
no matter how difficult he must succeed in it or die they did not think long but replied let him build your majesty in one day a more beautiful palace than this and if he fails in the attempt
let him be hung the king was pleased with this proposal and commanded ferko to set to work on the following day the two brothers were delighted for they thought they had now got rid of ferko for ever
as he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round the palace wondering how he could escape being put to death a little bee flew past and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear
what is troubling you my kind benefactor can i be of any help to you i am the bee whose wing you healed
a palace shall be built unlike any that king has dwelt in before just stay here till i come again and tell you that it is finished having said this she flew merrily away and ferko
be of good cheer and lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls and humming gaily she flew away again ferko went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished
the whole court went out to see the wonder and their astonishment was great at the sight which met their eyes a splendid palace reared itself on the hill just outside the walls of the city made of the most exquisite flowers
with sunflowers for knockers and all round hyacinths and other sweet smelling flowers bloomed in masses so that the air was perfumed far and near and enchanted all who were present
this splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee who had summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her the kings amazement knew no bounds and the princesss eyes beamed with delight
on the delighted ferko but the two brothers had grown quite green with envy and only declared the more that ferko was nothing but a wicked magician
the king although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his commands had been carried out was very vexed
and turning to the two brothers he said he has certainly accomplished the first task with the aid no doubt of his diabolical magic but what shall we give him to do now
let us make it as difficult as possible and if he fails he shall die then the eldest brother replied the corn has all been cut but it has not yet been put into barns
let the knave collect all the grain in the kingdom into one big heap before to morrow night and if as much as a stalk of corn is left let him be put to death
the princess grew white with terror when she heard these words but ferko felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time and wandered out into the meadows again
but he could think of no way of escape the sun sank to rest and night came on when a little mouse started out of the grass at ferkos feet and said to him im delighted to see you
my kind benefactor but why are you looking so sad can i be of any help to you and thus repay your great kindness to me then ferko recognised the mouse whose front paws he had healed and replied
before to morrow night all the grain in the kingdom has to be gathered into one big heap and if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting i must pay for it with my life is that all answered the mouse
that neednt distress you much just trust in me and before the sun sets again you shall hear that your task is done and with these words the little creature scampered away into the fields
ferko who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word lay down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning the day passed slowly
and the whole court went out to see the wonder
for in a heap higher than the kings palace lay all the grain of the country and not a single stalk of corn had been left behind in any of the fields and how had all this been done
the little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the land to its help and together they had collected all the grain in the kingdom the king could not hide his amazement but at the same time his wrath increased
and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers who kept on repeating
than a wicked magician only the beautiful princess rejoiced over ferkos success and looked on him with friendly glances which the youth returned the more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him
the more angry he became for he could not in the face of his promise put the stranger to death he turned once more to the two brothers and said his diabolical magic has helped him again
but now what third task shall we set him to do no matter how impossible it is he must do it or die the eldest answered quickly let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom on to this hill
before to morrow night if he does this he may go free if not he shall be hung as you have said at these words the princess burst into tears
and when the king saw this he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on the nearest tree ferko wandered out into the fields again
and sat down on the stump of a tree wondering what he should do next suddenly a big wolf ran up to him and standing still said im very glad to see you again my kind benefactor
what are you thinking about all alone by yourself if i can help you in any way only say the word for i would like to give you a proof of my gratitude ferko at once recognised the wolf
whose broken leg he had healed and told him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his life but how in the world he added am i to collect all the wolves of the kingdom on to that hill over there
if thats all you want done answered the wolf you neednt worry yourself ill undertake the task and youll hear from me again before sunset to morrow
and with these words he trotted quickly away then the youth rejoiced greatly for now he felt that his life was safe but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess
and that he would never see her again if he left the country he lay down once more on the grass and soon fell fast asleep all the next day he spent wandering about the fields
then return at once to me and get on my back and i will help you to drive all the wolves together then ferko went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done
ferko himself returned to the fields and mounting on the wolfs back he rode to the wood close by quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood and in a minute many hundred wolves rose up before him
increasing in number every moment till they could be counted by thousands he drove them all before him on to the hill where the king and his whole court and ferkos two brothers were standing only the lovely princess was not present
for she was shut up in her tower weeping bitterly the wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure of their wicked designs but the king was overcome by a sudden terror
when he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer and calling out to ferko he said enough enough we dont want any more but the wolf on whose back ferko sat said to its rider
go on go on and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill howling horribly and showing their white teeth the king in his terror called out stop a moment i will give you half my kingdom
if you will drive all the wolves away but ferko pretended not to hear and drove some more thousands before him so that everyone quaked with horror and fear then the king raised his voice again and called out
stop you shall have my whole kingdom if you will only drive these wolves back to the places they came from but the wolf kept on encouraging ferko and said go on go on so he led the wolves on
till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked brothers and ate them and the whole court up in a moment then ferko went straight to the palace and set the princess free and on the same day
he married her and was crowned king of the country and the wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes and ferko and his bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together
kletke once upon a time there were three princesses who were all three young and beautiful but the youngest although she was not fairer than the other two was the most loveable of them all
about half a mile from the palace in which they lived there stood a castle which was uninhabited and almost a ruin but the garden which surrounded it was a mass of blooming flowers
and in this garden the youngest princess used often to walk one day when she was pacing to and fro under the lime trees a black crow hopped out of a rose bush in front of her
the poor beast was all torn and bleeding and the kind little princess was quite unhappy about it when the crow saw this it turned to her and said i am not really a black crow
but an enchanted prince who has been doomed to spend his youth in misery if you only liked princess you could save me but you would have to say good bye to all your own people
and come and be my constant companion in this ruined castle there is one habitable room in it in which there is a golden bed there you will have to live all by yourself
and dont forget that whatever you may see or hear in the night you must not scream out for if you give as much as a single cry my sufferings will be doubled
the good natured princess at once left her home and her family and hurried to the ruined castle and took possession of the room with the golden bed
when night approached she lay down but though she shut her eyes tight sleep would not come at midnight she heard to her great horror some one coming along the passage and in a minute
her door was flung wide open and a troop of strange beings entered the room they at once proceeded to light a fire in the huge fireplace then they placed a great cauldron of boiling water on it
when they had done this they approached the bed on which the trembling girl lay and screaming and yelling all the time they dragged her towards the cauldron she nearly died with fright
but she never uttered a sound then of a sudden the cock crew and all the evil spirits vanished at the same moment the crow appeared and hopped all round the room with joy
it thanked the princess most heartily for her goodness and said that its sufferings had already been greatly lessened now one of the princesss elder sisters who was very inquisitive
that at last the good natured little princess consented but at midnight when the odd folk appeared the elder sister screamed with terror and from this time on the youngest princess
insisted always on keeping watch alone so she lived in solitude all the daytime and at night she would have been frightened had she not been so brave but every day
the crow came and thanked her for her endurance and assured her that his sufferings were far less than they had been and so two years passed away when one day the crow came to the princess and said
in another year i shall be freed from the spell i am under at present because then the seven years will be over but before i can resume my natural form
and take possession of the belongings of my forefathers you must go out into the world and take service as a maidservant the young princess consented at once and for a whole year
and had worked her little white hands weary she heard a rustling beside her and a cry of joy then she saw a handsome youth standing beside her who knelt down at her feet
and kissed the little weary white hands i am the prince he said who you in your goodness when i was wandering about in the shape of a black crow freed from the most awful torments
come now to my castle with me and let us live there happily together so they went to the castle where they had both endured so much
it was difficult to believe that it was the same for it had all been rebuilt and done up again
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers
ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged no sire replied treville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire
ill be their warranty and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestys service but what are they to do
would not one say he was speaking of a religious community in truth my dear captain
and by and by by and by we will see ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket
la vieuville said he take my place
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of justice before everything
yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible
and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say
had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning the party was to take place at saint germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac
who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah you incline me to think so said the king there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire
but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood
then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king
are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes treville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty
but i will not swear to it sire you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct
you are right treville but they were not alone your musketeers they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the kings musketeers one of whom was wounded
and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinals guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory
one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself dartagnan sire
he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well tell me how treville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting
placing his hand upon his hip sire resumed treville as i told you
he was dressed as a citizen the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see treville interrupted the king it was they who attacked
that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty
brave young man murmured the king well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry
he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy
it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man treville i will see him and if anything can be done
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand treville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel it is a brawl
that is true said the king but never mind treville come still by the back staircase treville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master
he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited
but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams
dartagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis
and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve the two musketeers were already there and were playing together
although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion
and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting
passed so close to dartagnans face
his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely
declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms
look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said
youre in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name
lest it be observed that we go out together you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way thats true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man
that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn
which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer
never mind be content i will do my best on guard but said he whom dartagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better
bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom
he hoped to intimidate but dartagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts
and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder
in whose service he had a relative
and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with dartagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror
and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue
at these cries all who were in the hotel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded
to his eminence thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels
to the rescue musketeers to the rescue
who hastened to the succor of their comrades the melee became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers
the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state
excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hotel
domestics in daring to make a sortie upon the kings musketeers the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock struck
they succeeded in calming their friends who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates but the gates were too strong they soon tired of the sport besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way
who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance
and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal
and the two will pass off together
directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of saint germain
required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency
the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it
everyone to return home and wait for news
with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the kings musketeers
whose relative as we already know bernajoux was
but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hotel they had endeavored to burn now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion
he repaired therefore immediately to his hotel and caused himself to be announced the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem both were men of courage and honor
we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair
and all the fault is with your musketeers
not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you
in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous
of which the doctor says bad things
perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth
then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed
returned to his hotel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner
that his eminences guardsmen had received
not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey
whom he had sent home two hours before from the hotel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him the reader may ask
when he was left stiff as a rush in london in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses has anyone brought a letter for me asked dartagnan eagerly
but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket
i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter
it is not natural for letters to enter peoples houses in this manner if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but no all was hermetically sealed
there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter
there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you be this evening about ten oclock at saint cloud
while reading this letter dartagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love
did i not guess truly is it not some bad affair
exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men
which the liberality of dartagnan had not entirely effaced left alone dartagnan read and reread his billet then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams
i am going out for all day perhaps you are therefore your own master till seven oclock in the evening but at seven oclock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols
ah like the charming journey the other day
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear
well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready
perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said dartagnan and nodding to planchet he went out
dartagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at saint cloud
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man
whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinals executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture
dartagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance
in a tine of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days
brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris
far from here oh lord no about forty leagues only
where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not
as i see there is no concealing anything from you yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer
so trifling indeed that dartagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing no
is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked dartagnan do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open
particularly in the night what the deuce can you expect i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning
that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter
which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well
this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile
so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend amuse yourself well replied bonacieux
he certainly would not have remarked it
his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative he found treville in a joyful mood he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered
he had retired at one oclock under the pretense of being indisposed as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the morning now said treville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone
now let us talk about yourself my young friend
the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied dartagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself
and knows that i have been to london the devil you have been to london was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger beware my dear dartagnan a present from an enemy is not a good thing
are there not some latin verses upon that subject stop yes doubtless replied dartagnan
beware of the enemy who makes you presents
why it is indeed a true royal jewel
by whom did the queen send you this jewel she gave it to me herself where in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet how giving me her hand to kiss
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor and that in the presence of witnesses imprudent thrice imprudent
oh the women the women cried the old soldier i know them by their romantic imagination everything that savors of mystery charms them so you have seen the arm that was all you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are
no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man
shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend
well then off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one
which may betray him who wears it sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign never said dartagnan then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony
does not find such stones in his mothers jewel case you think then i have something to dread asked dartagnan i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted
the devil said dartagnan
the devil what must i do above all things be always on your guard the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested what will they dare to arrest a man in his majestys service pardieu
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions if anyone seeks a quarrel with you
shun it were it with a child of ten years old if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot
lest one should give way beneath you if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be armed if
by the by you can be sure of your lackey mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all dartagnan blushed my mistress above all repeated he mechanically
you are acquainted with the scriptures
for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero
did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess
what has become of your three companions
detained by an accusation of coining
and how the devil did you escape
they merit richly that piece of attention on your part
ah young man young man some flirtation or other
it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands take my advice and set out this evening
ah thats quite another thing but promise me if you should not be killed tonight that you will go tomorrow i promise it do you need money
but your companions i dont think they can be in need of any we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure
neither of them had returned their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other
as he passed the hotel des gardes he took a glance in to the stables three of the four horses had already arrived
was busy grooming them and had already finished two
how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man
but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you
two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features
and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed
shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction
heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse
as already detailed that i was one night sitting at the great drawing room window lost in the melancholy reveries of night and in admiration of the moonlighted scene i was the only occupant of the room
hardly reached to the window at which i sat the shorn grass sloped gently downward from the windows till it met the broad level on which stood in clumps or solitarily scattered some of the noblest timber in england
hoar in the moonbeams stood those graceful trees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass and in the background crowning the undulations of the distance in masses were piled those woods among which lay the solitary tomb
to me funereal but glorious woods which formed the background of the picture my thoughts recurred to my fathers mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor and the thought of the unknown journey saddened me
in all that concerned his religion from very early association there was to me something of the unearthly and spectral when my dear mamma died i was not nine years old and i remember two days before the funeral
there came to knowl where she died a thin little man with large black eyes and a very grave dark face he was shut up a good deal with my dear father who was in deep affliction and missus rusk used to say
and good mister clay ready at call in the village much good that little black whipper snapper will do him with that little black man on the day after the funeral i was sent out for some reason for a walk my governess was ill i know
and there was confusion in the house and i dare say the maids made as much of a holiday as they could i remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man but i was not afraid of him for he was gentle though sad and seemed kind
he led me into the garden the dutch garden we used to call it with a balustrade and statues at the farther front laid out in a carpet pattern of brilliantly coloured flowers we came down the broad flight of caen stone steps into this
and we walked in silence to the balustrade the base was too high at the spot where we reached it for me to see over but holding my hand he said
well you cant but i can see beyond it shall i tell you what i see ever so much i see a cottage with a steep roof that looks like gold in the sunlight
growing by the walls and windows and two little children are playing among the stems of the trees and we are on our way there and in a few minutes shall be under those trees ourselves and talking to those little children
yet now to me it is but a picture in my brain and to you but a story told by me which you believe come dear let us be going so we descended the steps at the right
and there we stood in rich sunlight among the many objects he had described is this your house my little men he asked of the children pretty little rosy boys who assented and he leaned with his open hand against the stem of one of the trees
the same on which i was now looking in the distance every now and then he made me sit down to rest
would relate some little story reflecting even to my childish mind a strange suspicion of a spiritual meaning
and somehow startling in its very vagueness thus entertained though a little awfully i accompanied the dark mysterious little whipper snapper through the woodland glades
we came to me quite unexpectedly in the deep sylvan shadows upon the grey pillared temple four fronted with a slanting pedestal of lichen stained steps
the lonely sepulchre in which i had the morning before seen poor mamma laid at the sight the fountains of my grief reopened and i cried bitterly repeating oh mamma mamma little mamma
and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent there was a stone bench some ten steps away from the tomb sit down beside me my child said the grave man with the black eyes very kindly and gently
now what do you see there he asked pointing horizontally with his stick towards the centre of the opposite structure oh that that place where poor mamma is
yes a stone wall with pillars too high for either you or me to see over but here he mentioned a name which i think must have been swedenborg
i only know that it sounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale i fancied he lived in the wood which surrounded us and i began to grow frightened as he proceeded but swedenborg sees beyond it over and through it
and has told me all that concerns us to know he says your mamma is not there she is taken away i cried starting up and with streaming eyes gazing on the building which though i stamped my feet in my distraction
i was afraid to approach oh is mamma taken away where is she where have they brought her to i was uttering unconsciously very nearly the question with which mary
in the grey of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty sepulchre accosted the figure standing near your mamma is alive but too far away to see or hear us swedenborg standing here can see and hear her
and tells me all he sees just as i told you in the garden about the little boys and the cottage and the trees and flowers which you could not see
so i can tell you now as i did then and as we are both i hope walking on to the same place just as we did to the trees and cottage
how true the description is which i give you i was very frightened for i feared that when he had done his narrative
and of shadows where the dead were visible he leaned his elbow on his knee and his forehead on his hand which shaded his downcast eyes in that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape
radiant with a wondrous light in which rejoicing my mother moved along an airy path ascending among mountains of fantastic height and peaks melting in celestial colouring into the air
he said the same words he had spoken before come dear let us go oh no no no not now i said resisting and very much frightened home i mean dear
we cannot walk to the place i have described we can only reach it through the gate of death to which we are all tending young and old with sure steps and where is the gate of death i asked in a sort of whisper as we walked together
holding his hand and looking stealthily he smiled sadly and said when sooner or later the time comes as hagars eyes were opened in the wilderness and she beheld the fountain of water
so shall each of us see the door open before us and enter in and be refreshed for a long time following this walk i was very nervous more so for the awful manner in which missus rusk received my statement
with stern lips and upturned hands and eyes and an angry expostulation i do wonder at you mary quince letting the child walk into the wood with that limb of darkness it is a mercy he did not show her the devil
or frighten her out of her senses in that lonely place of these swedenborgians indeed i know no more than i might learn from good missus rusks very inaccurate talk two or three of them crossed in the course of my early life
but i grew after a day or two so nervous that i laid it aside it is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions which so far from superseding confirmed
and interpreted the language of the bible and as dear papa accepted their ideas i am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ leaning on my hand i was now looking upon that solemn wood
white and shadowy in the moonlight where for a long time after that ramble with the visionary i fancied the gate of death hidden only by a strange glamour and the dazzling land of ghosts were situate
and i suppose these earlier associations gave to my reverie about my fathers coming visitor
chapter six a walk in the wood two little pieces of by play in which i detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion from the corner of the gallery i one day saw her when she thought i was out and all quiet
with her ear at the keyhole of papas study
her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs from which only she apprehended surprise her great mouth was open and her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness she was devouring all that was passing there
indignation however quickly returned and i came back treading briskly as i did so when i reached the angle of the gallery again madame i suppose had heard me for she was half way down the stairs
i am so glad to find you and you are dress to come out we shall have so pleasant walk at that moment the door of my fathers study opened and missus rusk with her dark energetic face very much flushed stepped out in high excitement
the master says you may have the brandy bottle madame and im glad to be rid of it i am madame courtesied with a great smirk that was full of intangible hate and insult better your own brandy if drink you must exclaimed missus rusk
you may come to the store room now or the butler can take it and off whisked missus rusk for the back staircase there had been no common skirmish on this occasion but a pitched battle madame had made a sort of pet of anne wixted an underchambermaid
with a brandy bottle under her apron stealing up stairs
madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town and convey it to her bed room upon this missus rusk impounded the flask and with anne beside her rather precipitately appeared before the master he heard and summoned madame
madame was cool frank and fluent the brandy was purely medicinal she produced a document in the form of a note doctor somebody presented his compliments to madame de la rougierre and ordered her a table spoonful of brandy
and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain of stomach returned
she claimed her medicine mans estimate of woman is higher than womans own perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy perhaps womans is the juster and the other an appointed illusion
i dont know but so it is ordained missus rusk was recalled and i saw as you are aware madames procedure during the interview it was a great battle a great victory madame was in high spirits
the air was sweet the landscape charming i so good everything so beautiful where should we go this way i had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to madame i was so incensed at the treachery i had witnessed
but such resolutions do not last long with very young people and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual i dont wish to go into the wood madame and for what poor mamma is buried there
is there the vault demanded madame eagerly i assented my faith curious reason you say because poor mamma is buried there you will not approach
how solemn murmured madame what noble tomb
as i approached i happened to look i cant tell why suddenly over my shoulder i was startled for madame was grimacing after me with a vile derisive distortion she pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing
but it would not do she saw that i had detected her and she laughed aloud
do you think your house of knowl down there is what you call haunt my dear why said i flushing and growing pale again i felt quite afraid of madame and confounded at the suddenness of all this because anne wixted
she says there is ghost how dark is this place and so many of the ruthyn family they are buried here is not so how high and thick are the trees all round and nobody comes near
and madame rolled her eyes awfully as if she expected to see something unearthly and indeed looked very like it herself come away madame i said growing frightened and feeling that if i were once by any accident
to give way to the panic that was gathering round me i should instantaneously lose all control of myself oh come away do madame im frightened no on the contrary sit here by me
un gout bizarre vraiment but i love very much to be near to the dead people
do madame pray speak of something else wat little fool but no you are not afraid i av seen the ghosts myself i saw one for example last night shape like a monkey sitting in the corner
with his arms round his knees very wicked old old man his face was like and white eyes so large come away madame you are trying to frighten me i said in the childish anger which accompanies fear madame laughed an ugly laugh and said
wat good man is your father very the kindest darling i dont know why it is madame i am so afraid of him and never could tell him how much i love him this confidential talking with madame strange to say
doctor bryerly i think they call him yes a doctor bryerly who remained a few days shall we begin to walk towards home madame do pray
oh no ma foi i have heard nothing but if the doctor came it was not because he was quite well but that doctor is a doctor in theology i fancy i know he is a swedenborgian and papa is so well he could not have come as a physician
but still you know your father is old man
oh yes he is old man
as he made his will my dear every man so rich as he especially so old
there is no need of haste madame it is quite time enough when his health begins to fail
but you are not such fool as you feign yourself no no you know everything come tell me all about it is for your advantage you know what is in his will and when he wrote but madame i really know nothing of it
i cant say whether there is a will or not let us talk of something else
he will not come to lie here a day sooner by cause of that
would not that be pity i really dont know anything of his will
he has never spoken of it to me i know he loves me that is enough
you do know everything of course
otherwise i will break your little finger tell me everything i know nothing of papas will you dont know madame how you hurt me let us speak of something else you do know and you must tell petite dure tete
with which words she seized that joint and laughing spitefully she twisted it suddenly back i screamed while she continued to laugh will you tell yes yes let me go i shrieked she did not release it immediately however
but continued her torture and discordant laughter at last she finally released my finger
what do you cry for little fool youve hurt me very much
what cross girl i will never play with you again never let us go home madame was silent and morose all the way home she would not answer my questions and affected to be very lofty and offended
this did not last very long however and she soon resumed her wonted ways and she returned to the question of the will but not so directly and with more art
lady knollys pursued her enquiries and why does not madame make your dresses my dear i wager a guinea the womans a milliner did not she engage to make your dresses i
she is my governess a finishing governess missus rusk says finishing fiddle hoity toity and my ladys too grand to cut out your dresses and help to sew them and what does she do
but she is ill i answered and all this time i was ready to cry for vexation thinking of my dress which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative
is she up or in bed in her room but not in bed i should so like to see her my dear it is not mere curiosity i assure you in fact curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it
but she may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable she may teach you a bad accent
and heaven knows what beside send the housekeeper my dear to tell her that i am going to see her i had better go myself perhaps i said fearing a collision between missus rusk and the bitter frenchwoman very well dear
not sorry somehow to escape before captain oakley returned as i went along the passage i was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it and trying in vain
to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garrulous dandy i could not quite the reverse indeed still i was uncomfortable and feverish
girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable under similar circumstances such a misgiving would make them it was a long way to madames room i met missus rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid
how is madame i asked quite well i believe answered the housekeeper drily nothing the matter that i know of she eat enough for two to day
i try to swallow a little to please her and your cold is it better she shook her head languidly her elbow resting on the chair and three finger tips supporting her forehead and then she made a little sigh
looking down from the corners of her eyes in an interesting dejection
but i am quaite appy
and with these words she turned a languid glance of gratitude on me which dropped on the ground lady knollys wishes very much to see you only for a few minutes if you could admit her
vous savez les malades see never visitors she replied with a startled sort of tartness and a momentary energy besides i cannot converse
of head and of the ear the right ear it is parfois agony absolutely and now it is here and she winced and moaned with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the organ affected
simple as i was i felt instinctively that madame was shamming she was over acting her transitions were too violent and beside she forgot that i knew how well she could speak english and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness
by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom i there fore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly oh madame dont you really think you might without much inconvenience see lady knollys for a very few minutes
but it is impossible you must see quite impossible i never you know refuse to take trouble when i am able never never and madame shed some tears which always came at call
and with her hand pressed to her ear said very faintly be so good to tell your friend how you see me and how i suffer
since the pain will not allow me to remain longer so with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused
i returned to the drawing room
has gone to the billiard room i think
that then accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which i had heard as i passed the door i have been telling maud how detestably she is got up very thoughtful of you monica said my father
yes and really austin it is quite clear you ought to marry you want some one to take this girl out and look after her and whos to do it
and it is really such a pity for shes a very pretty creature and a clever woman could make her quite charming
eight and twenty years ago or more with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds well you know she has got ever so much now
and though you would not have her then she has had her second husband since i can tell you im glad i was not the first said my father well they really say her wealth is absolutely immense her last husband
the russian merchant left her everything she has not a human relation and she is in the best set you were always a match maker monica said my father stopping and putting his hand kindly on hers
but it wont do no no monica we must take care of little maud some other way i was relieved we women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages
and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger and i remember whenever my father which indeed was but seldom made a visit to town or anywhere else it was a saying of missus rusk
i shant wonder neither need you my dear if he brings home a young wife with him so my father with a kind look at her and a very tender one on me went silently to the library as he often did about that hour
i suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at knowl and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance but it was impossible long to be vexed with cousin monica
you know my dear your father is an oddity she said i dont mind him i never did you must not cracky my dear cracky decidedly cracky and she tapped the corner of her forehead with a look so sly and comical
that i think i should have laughed if the sentiment had not been so awfully irreverent well dear how is our friend the milliner madame is suffering so much from pain in her ear that she says it would be quite impossible to have the honour honour fiddle
pain in her ear you say poor thing well dear i think i can cure that in five minutes i have it myself now and then come to my room and well get the bottles so she lighted her candle in the lobby and with a light and agile step
she scaled the stairs i following and having found the remedies we approached madames room together i think while we were still at the end of the gallery madame heard and divined our approach for her door suddenly shut
and there was a fumbling at the handle but the bolt was out of order
there was no answer so she opened the door and we both entered madame had rolled herself in the blue coverlet and was lying on the bed with her face buried in the pillow and enveloped in the covering perhaps shes asleep said lady knollys
getting round to the side of the bed and stooping over her madame lay still as a mouse cousin monica set down her two little vials on the table and stooping again over the bed began very gently with her fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face
madame uttered a slumbering moan and turned more upon her face clasping the coverlet faster about her madame it is maud and lady knollys we have come to relieve your ear pray let me see it
courting a broomstick the side show let us now describe some of the manifestations of hypnotism to see just how it operates and how it exhibits itself
the following is a description of a public performance given by doctor herbert l flint a very successful public operator it is in the language of an eye witness a new york lawyer
in response to a call for volunteers twenty young and middle aged men came upon the stage they evidently belonged to the great middle class the entertainment commenced by doctor flint passing around the group
who were seated on the stage in a semicircle facing the audience and stroking each ones head and forehead repeating the phrases close your eyes think of nothing but sleep you are very tired you are drowsy
you feel very sleepy as he did this several of the volunteers closed their eyes at once and one fell asleep immediately one or two remained awake
while a few were wide awake and smiling at the rest these latter were dismissed as unlikely subjects when the stage had been cleared of all those who were not responsive the doctor passed around and snapping his finger
at each individual awoke him one of the subjects when questioned afterward as to what sensation he experienced at the snapping of the fingers replied that it seemed to him as if something inside of his head responded
and with this sensation he regained self consciousness this is to be doubted as a rule subjects in this stage of hypnotism do not feel any sensation that they can remember
that you cant pull them apart they are fast you cannot pull them apart try you cant the whole class made frantic efforts to unclasp their hands but were unable to do so the doctors explanation of this is
that what they were really doing was to force their hands closer together thus obeying the counter suggestion that they thought they were trying to unclasp their hands was evident from their endeavors
one young fellow aged about eighteen said that he was addicted to the cigarette habit the suggestion was made to him that he would not be able to smoke a cigarette for twenty four hours after the entertainment he was asked to smoke as was his usual habit
he was then away from any one who could influence him he replied that the very idea was repugnant however he was induced to take a cigarette in his mouth but it made him ill and he flung it away with every expression of disgust
this is an instance of what is called post hypnotic suggestion doctor cocke tells of suggesting to a drinker whom he was trying to cure of the habit that for the next three days anything he took would make him vomit
they immediately began and twirled them faster and faster in spite of their efforts to stop one of the subjects said he thought of nothing but the strange action of his hands and sometimes it puzzled him to know why they whirled
at this point doctor flints daughter took charge of the class she pointed her finger at one of them and the subject began to look steadily before him at which the rest of the class were highly amused
presently the subjects head leaned forward the pupils of his eyes dilated and assumed a peculiar glassy stare he arose with a steady gliding gait
then he stopped miss flint led him to the front of the stage and left him standing in profound slumber he stood there stooping eyes set and vacant fast asleep
in the meantime the act had caused great laughter among the rest of the class one young fellow in particular laughed so uproariously that tears coursed down his cheeks and he took out his handkerchief to wipe his eyes
just as he was returning it to his pocket the lady suddenly pointed a finger at him
but the moment the gesture was made his countenance fell his mirth stopped while that of his companions redoubled and the change was so obvious that the audience shared in the laughter but the subject neither saw nor heard
his eyes assumed the same expression that had been noticed in his companions he too arose in the same attitude as if his head were pulling the body along and following the finger in the same way as his predecessor
another was given a broomstick and told to hunt game in the woods before him another was given a large rag doll and told that it was an infant and that he must look among the audience and discover the father
he was informed that he could tell who the father was by the similarity and the color of the eyes these suggestions were made in a loud tone miss flint being no nearer one subject than another
the bare suggestion was given as now think that you are a newsboy and are selling papers or now think that you are hunting and are going into the woods to shoot birds so the party was started
at the same time into the audience the one who was impersonating a newsboy went about crying his edition in a loud voice while the hunter crawled along stealthily and carefully
the newsboy even adopted the well worn device of asking those whom he solicited to buy to help him get rid of his stock one man offered him a cent when the price was two cents the newsboy chaffed the would be purchaser
and taking him into the center of the stage showed him a small riding whip he looked at it indifferently enough he was told it was a hot bar of iron but he shook his head still incredulous
the suggestion was repeated and as the glazed look came into his eyes the incredulous look died out every member of the class was following the suggestion made to the subject in hand all of them had the same expression in their eyes the doctor said
that his daughter was hypnotizing the whole class through this one individual as she spoke she lightly touched the subject with the end of the whip the moment the subject felt the whip he jumped and shrieked as if it really were a hot iron
she touched each one of the class in succession and every one manifested the utmost pain and fear one subject sat down on the floor and cried in dire distress
had the suggestion been continued it would undoubtedly have raised a blister one of the amusing experiments tried at a later time was that of a tall young man diffident pale and modest being given a broom carefully wrapped in a sheet
and told that it was his sweetheart he accepted the situation and sat down by the broom he was a little sheepish at first but eventually he grew bolder and smiled upon her such a smile as malvolio casts upon olivia
the manner in which little by little he ventured upon a familiar footing was exceedingly funny but when in a moment of confident response to his wooing he clasped her round the waist and imprinted a chaste kiss upon the brushy part of the broom
disguised by the sheet the house resounded with roars of laughter the subject however was deaf to all of the noise he was absorbed in his courtship and he continued to hug the broom and exhibit in his features
all the world loves a lover as the saying is and all the world loves to laugh at him one of the subjects was told that the head of a man in the audience was on fire
he looked for a moment and then dashed down the platform into the audience and seizing the mans head vigorously rubbed it as this did not extinguish the flames he took off his coat and put the fire out in doing this he set his coat on fire
then he calmly resumed his garment and walked back to the stage the side show closed the evenings entertainment a young man was told to think of himself as managing a side show at a circus
when his mind had absorbed this idea he was ordered to open his exhibition he at once mounted a table and in the voice of the traditional side show fakir began to dilate upon the fat woman and the snakes
that for the small sum of ten cents they could see more wonders than ever before had been crowded under one canvas tent he harangued the crowd as they surged about the tent door
he pointed to a suppositious canvas picture he chaffed the boys he flattered the vanity of the young fellows with their girls telling them that they could not afford for the small sum of ten cents to miss this great show
how the subject feels under hypnotization doctor coopers experience effect of music doctor alfred marthieus experiments
the sensations produced during a state of hypnosis are very interesting as may be supposed they differ greatly in different persons
one of the most interesting accounts ever given is that of doctor james r cocke a hypnotist himself who submitted to being operated upon by a professional magnetizer
he was at that time a firm believer in the theory of personal magnetism a delusion from which he afterward escaped on the occasion which he describes the operator commanded him to close his eyes
but he did open them at once again he told him to close the eyes and at the same time he gently stroked his head and face and eyelids with his hand doctor cocke fancied he felt a tingling sensation in his forehead and eyes
which he supposed came from the hand of the operator afterward he came to believe that this sensation was purely imaginary on his part then he says a sensation akin to fear came over me
the operator said you are going to sleep you are getting sleepy you cannot open your eyes i was conscious that my heart was beating rapidly and i felt a sensation of terror
he then made passes over my head down over my hands and body but did not touch me he then said to me you cannot open your eyes the motor apparatus of my lids would not seemingly respond to my will
yet i was conscious that while one part of my mind wanted to open my eyes another part did not want to so i was in a paradoxical state i believed that i could open my eyes and yet could not
the feeling of not wishing to open my eyes was not based upon any desire to please the operator i had no personal interest in him in any way but be it understood i firmly believed in his power to control me
then he stroked the arm and said it was growing numb he said you have no feeling in it have you doctor cocke goes on i said no and i knew that i said no
the operator went on pricking the arm with a pin and though doctor cocke felt the pain he said he did not feel it and at the same time the sensation of terror increased i was not conscious of my body at all he says further on
but i was painfully conscious of the two contradictory elements within me i knew that my body existed but could not prove it to myself i knew that the statements made by the operator were in a measure untrue
i obeyed them voluntarily and involuntarily this is the last remembrance that i have of that hypnotic experience after this however the operator caused the doctor to do a number of things which he learned of from his friends after the performance was over
it seemed to me that the hypnotist commanded me to awake as soon as i dropped my arm and yet ten minutes of unconsciousness had passed on a subsequent occasion doctor cocke who was blind was put into a deep hypnotic sleep
by fixing his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand this time he experienced a still greater degree of terror and incidentally learned that he could hypnotize himself the matter of self hypnotism
we shall consider in another chapter in this connection we find great interest in an article in the medical news july twenty eighth eighteen ninety four
in which he describes the effects of music upon hypnotic subjects while in vienna he took occasion to observe closely the enthusiastic musical devotees as they sat in the audience at the performance of one of wagners operas
he believed they were in a condition of self induced hypnotism in which their subjective faculties were so exalted as to supersede their objective perceptions music was no longer to them a succession of pleasing sounds
but the embodiment of a drama in which they became so wrapped up that they forgot all about the mechanical and external features of the music and lived completely in a fairy world of dream
this observation suggested to him an interesting series of experiments his first subject was easily hypnotized and of an emotional nature wagners
was played from the piano score the pulse of the subject became more rapid and at first of higher tension increasing from a normal rate of sixty beats a minute to one hundred twenty then
as the music progressed the tension diminished the respiration increased from eighteen to thirty per minute great excitement in the subject was evident his whole body was thrown into motion his legs were drawn up his arms tossed into the air
the state of mind brought up before him in the most realistic and vivid manner possible the picture of the ride of tam oshanter which he had seen years before the picture
soon became real to him and he found himself taking part in a wild chase not as witch devil or tam even but in some way his consciousness was spread through every part of the scene being of it
and yet playing the part of spectator as is often the case in dreams doctor warthin tried the same experiment again this time on a young man who was not so emotional and was hypnotized with much more difficulty
this subject did not pass into such a deep state of hypnotism but the result was practically the same the pulse rate rose from seventy to one hundred twenty the sensation remembered was that of riding furiously through the air
the experiment was repeated on other subjects in all cases with the same result
to him it always expressed the pictured wild ride of the daughters of wotan the subject taking part in the ride it was noticeable in each case that the same music played to them in the waking state produced no special impression
at first it seemed to produce the opposite effect for the pulse was lowered later it rose to a rate double the normal and the tension was diminished the impression described by the subject afterward
and the subject seemed to contemplate a landscape of lofty grandeur a different sort of music was played
appears to summon sigmund to valhalla
it became slow and irregular and very small the respiration decreased almost to gasping the face grew pale and a cold perspiration broke out readers who are especially interested in this subject
will find descriptions of many other interesting experiments in the same article doctor cocke describes a peculiar trick he played upon the sight of a subject says he i once hypnotized a man
and call the letters as i directed stimulation was in this case impossible as i made him read fifteen or twenty pages he calling the letters as suggested each time they occurred the extraordinary heightening
and clairvoyance if the powers of the mind are so enormously increased all that is required of a very sensitive and easily hypnotized person is to hypnotize him or herself when he will be able to read thoughts
and it is true that a person can deliberately hypnotize himself when he wishes to till he has become accustomed to it and is expert in it so to speak it does away at a stroke with the claims of all professional hypnotists and magnetic healers
that they have any peculiar power in themselves which they exert over their fellows one of these professionals gives an account in his book of what he calls the wonderful lock method he says that
though he is locked up in a separate room he can make the psychic power work through the walls all that he does is to put his subjects in the way of hypnotizing themselves
he shows his inconsistency when he states that under certain circumstances the hypnotizer is in danger of becoming hypnotized himself in this he makes no claim that the subject is using any psychic power
but of course if the hypnotizer looks steadily into the eyes of his subject and the subject looks into his eyes the steady gaze on a bright object will produce hypnotism in one quite as readily as in the other
hypnotism is an established scientific fact but the claim that the hypnotizer has any mysterious psychic power is the invariable mark of the charlatan
probably no scientific phenomenon was ever so grossly prostituted to base ends as that of hypnotism later we shall see some of the outrageous forms this charlatanism assumes
and how it extends to the professional subjects as well as to the professional operators till those subjects even impose upon scientific men who ought to be proof against such deception
moreover the possibility of self hypnotization carefully concealed and called by another name opens another great field of humbug and charlatanism of which the advertising columns of the newspapers are constantly filled
namely that of the clairvoyant and medium we may conceive how such a profession might become perfectly legitimate and highly useful but at present it seems as if any person who went into it
however honest he might be at the start soon began to deceive himself as well as others until he lost his power entirely to distinguish between fact and imagination before discussing the matter further
let us quote doctor cockes experiment in hypnotizing himself it will be remembered that a professional hypnotizer or magnetizer had hypnotized him by telling him to fix his mind on the number twenty six and holding up his hand
i was intensely cold my heart seemed to stand still i had ringing in my ears my hair seemed to rise upon my scalp i persisted in the effort and the previously mentioned noise in my ears grew louder and louder
the roar became deafening it crackled like a mighty fire i was fearfully conscious of myself having read vivid accounts of dreams visions et cetera it occurred to me that i would experience them
i felt in a vague way that there were beings all about me but could not hear their voices i felt as though every muscle in my body was fixed and rigid
the roar in my ears grew louder still and i heard above the roar reports which sounded like artillery and musketry then above the din of the noise a musical chord i seemed to be absorbed in this chord i knew nothing else
secondly i wished to be hypnotized these together with a vivid imagination and strained attention brought on the states which occurred
his descriptions of dreams bear a wonderful likeness to de quinceys dreams such as those described in the english mail coach de profundis and the confessions of an english opium eater
all of which were presumably due to opium the causes which doctor cocke thinks produced the hypnotic condition in his case namely belief desire to be hypnotized and strained attention united with a vivid imagination
are causes which are often found in conjunction and produce effects which we may reasonably explain on the theory of self hypnotization
for instance the effects of an exciting religious revival are very like those produced by mesmers operations in paris the subjects become hysterical and are ready to believe anything or do anything
by prolonging the operation a whole community becomes more or less hypnotized in all such cases however unusual excitement is commonly followed by unusual lethargy
in fact it is a sort of intoxication the same phenomena are probably accountable for many of the strange records of history the wonderful cures at lourdes of which we have read in zolas novel of that name
are no doubt the effect of hypnotization by the priests some of the strange movements of whole communities during the crusades are to be explained either on the theory of hypnotization or of contagion
and possibly these two things will turn out to be much the same in fact on no other ground can we explain the so called childrens crusade in which over thirty thousand children from germany from all classes of the community
tried to cross the alps in winter and in their struggles were all lost or sold into slavery without even reaching the holy land again hypnotism is accountable for many of the poets dreams
gazing steadily at a bed of bright coals or a stream of running water will invariably throw a sensitive subject into a hypnotic sleep that will last sometimes for several hours doctor cocke says
that he has experimented in this direction with patients of his says he they have the ability to resist the state or to bring it at will many of them describe beautiful scenes from nature or some mighty cathedral
with its lofty dome or the faces of imaginary beings beautiful or demoniacal according to the will and temper of the subject perhaps the most wonderful example of self hypnotism which we have in history
is that of the mystic swedenborg who saw such strange things in his visions and at last came to believe in them as real the same explanation may be given of the manifestations of oriental prophets
for in the orient hypnotism is much easier and more systematically developed than with us of the west the performances of the dervishes and also of the fakirs who wound themselves and perform many wonderful feats
their impersonations are ridiculous in the extreme one man i remember believed himself to be controlled by the spirit of charles sumner being uneducated he used the most wretched english
and his language was utterly devoid of sense while on the other hand a very intelligent lady who believed herself to be controlled by the spirit of charlotte cushman personated the part very well doctor cooke says of himself
i can hypnotize myself to such an extent that i will become wholly unconscious of events taking place around me and a long interval of time say from one half to two hours will be a complete blank
the summer passed away and the bleak fall came myles had long since accepted his position as one set apart from the others of his kind and had resigned himself to the evident fact that he was never to serve in the household in waiting upon the earl
the other lads were sometimes occupied by their household duties when sports were afoot in which they would liked to have taken part myles was always free to enter into any matter of the kind after his daily exercise had been performed at the pels the butts or the tilting court
the lady anne the daughter of the house a tall thin dark eyed dark haired handsome young dame of twenty or twenty one years of age hawk nosed like her father and silent proud and haughty myles heard the squires say
lady alice the earl of mackworths niece and ward a great heiress in her own right a strikingly pretty black eyed girl of fourteen or fifteen these composed the earls personal family
but besides them was lord george beaumont his earls brother and him myles soon came to know better than any of the chief people of the castle excepting sir james lee for since myless great battle in the armory lord george
for the princely nobles of those days lived in state little less royal than royalty itself most of the knights and gentlemen myles soon came to know by sight meeting them in lord georges apartments in the south wing of the great house
and some of them following the lead of lord george singled him out for friendly notice giving him a nod or a word in passing every season has its pleasures for boys and the constant change that they bring is one of the greatest delights of boyhoods days
all of us as we grow older have in our memory pictures of by gone times that are somehow more than usually vivid the colors of some not blurring by time as others do
one of which in remembering always filled myless heart in after years with an indefinable pleasure was the recollection of standing with others of his fellow squires
which when the east wind was straining flew low overhead to pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyond the brow of the hill
shot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat good natured mother joan graced the rude mess table of the squires in the long hall and even the toughest and fishiest drake so the fruit of their skill had a savor that somehow or other
the daintiest fare lacked in after years then fall passed and winter came bleak cold and dreary not winter as we know it nowadays with warm fires and bright lights to make the long nights sweet and cheerful with comfort
but winter with all its grimness and sternness in the great cold stone walled castles of those days the only fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazing logs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace
around which the folks gathered sheltering their faces as best they could from the scorching heat and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold for at the farther end of the room where giant shadows swayed and bowed and danced huge and black against the high walls
but at the best only rude stories and jests recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listening circle gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse gross jests and coarser grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter
yet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days and cold and biting as was the frost in the cheerless windy halls and corridors of the castle it was not without its joys to the young lads for then as now boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather
when the sodden snow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of thrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over and the lads making themselves skates of marrow bones which they bought from the hall cook at a groat a pair went skimming over the smooth surface
while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them from the top of the bleak gray walls then at yule tide which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the merry christmas season of our day a great feast was held in the hall
and all the castle folk were fed in the presence of the earl and the countess oxen and sheep were roasted whole huge suet puddings made of barley meal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums were boiled in great caldrons in the open courtyard
whole barrels of ale and malmsey were broached and all the folk gentle and simple were bidden to the feast afterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play and in the evening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the north hall
for a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the good things left from that great feast until everyone grew to loathe fine victuals and longed for honest beef and mustard again then at last in that constant change the winter was gone
and even the lads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm once more and the grass showed green in sunny places and the leader of the wild fowl blew his horn as they who in the fall had flown to the south flew arrow like northward again
when the buds swelled and the leaves burst forth once more and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in the green grass like sparks and flames of gold with the spring came the out door sports of the season among others that of ball
for boys were boys and played at ball even in those faraway days a game called trap ball even yet in some parts of england it is played just as it was in myles falworths day and enjoyed just as myles and his friends enjoyed it
so now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game of trap ball was in full swing every afternoon the play ground being an open space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and that of the privy garden
myles himself was at the trap barehanded and barearmed the wind was blowing from behind him and aided perhaps by it he had already struck three of four balls nearly the whole length of the court an unusual distance
and several of the lads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden to catch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that then once more myles struck throwing all his strength into the blow the ball shot up into the air
and when it fell it was to drop within the privy garden the shouts of the young players were instantly stilled and gascoyne who stood nearest myles thrust his hands into his belt giving a long shrill whistle
there be no more play for us until we get another ball the outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in a little circle around myles i could not help it said myles in answer to their grumbling how knew i the ball would fly so far
wouldst get thyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs like poor diccon cook of all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the most sacred it was a small plot of ground only a few rods long and wide
and was kept absolutely private for the use of the countess and her family only a little while before myles had first come to devlen one of the cooks men had been found climbing the wall whereupon the soldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow
the poor fellow dropped from the wall into the garden and when they found him he still held a bunch of flowers in his hand which he had perhaps been gathering for his sweetheart had myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as gascoyne and some of the others had done
he might have thought twice before venturing to enter the ladies private garden as it was he only shook his stubborn head and said again i will climb the wall and fetch it
now at the lower extremity of the court and about twelve or fifteen feet distant from the garden wall there grew a pear tree some of the branches of which overhung into the garden beyond so first making sure that no one was looking that way
and bidding the others keep a sharp lookout myles shinned up this tree and choosing one of the thicker limbs climbed out upon it for some little distance then lowering his body he hung at arms length the branch bending with his weight and slowly let himself down
hand under hand until at last he hung directly over the top of the wall and perhaps a foot above it below him he could see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth of clematis and even as he hung there
he noticed the broad smooth walks the grassy terrace in front of the countesss apartments in the distance the quaint flower beds the yew trees trimmed into odd shapes and even the deaf old gardener working bare armed in the sunlight at a flower bed in the far corner by the tool house
the top of the wall was pointed like a house roof and immediately below him was covered by a thick growth of green moss and it flashed through his mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slippery foothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top
but it was too late to draw back now bracing himself for a moment he loosed his hold upon the limb above the branch flew back with a rush and he dropped striving to grasp the sloping angle with his feet
flew through his brain like a cloud of flies and then a leafy greenness seemed to strike up against him a splintering crash sounded in his ears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him and with one final clutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath
but at least he understood after a few conversations with mister havisham that he could gratify all his nearest wishes and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight which caused mister havisham much diversion
in the week before they sailed for england he did many curious things the lawyer long after remembered the morning they went down town together to pay a visit to dick
and the afternoon they so amazed the apple woman of ancient lineage by stopping before her stall and telling her she was to have a tent and a stove and a shawl and a sum of money which seemed to her quite wonderful
so i think i dont know how painful a persons bones can be but ive sympathized with you a great deal and i hope youll be better shes a very good apple woman he said to mister havisham as they walked away
leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath and not at all believing in her great fortune once when i fell down and cut my knee she gave me an apple for nothing ive always remembered her for it you know
you always remember people who are kind to you it had never occurred to his honest simple little mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses the interview with dick was quite exciting
dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with jake and was in low spirits when they saw him his amazement when cedric calmly announced that they had come to give him what seemed a very great thing to him and would set all his troubles right
the statement that his old friend had become a lord and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough caused dick to so open his eyes and mouth and start that his cap fell off when he picked it up he uttered a rather singular exclamation
mister hobbs thought id had a sunstroke i didnt think i was going to like it myself but i like it better now im used to it the one who is the earl now hes my grandpapa and he wants me to do anything i like
hes very kind if he is an earl and he sent me a lot of money by mister havisham and ive brought some to you to buy jake out
and found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a most astonishing sign and outfit he could not believe in his good luck any more easily than the apple woman of ancient lineage could believe in hers
he walked about like a boot black in a dream he stared at his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment he scarcely seemed to realize anything until cedric put out his hand to shake hands with him before going away
well good bye he said and though he tried to speak steadily there was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes and i hope tradell be good im sorry im going away to leave you
but perhaps i shall come back again when im an earl and i wish youd write to me because we were always good friends and if you write to me heres where you must send your letter and he gave him a slip of paper
and he would have found it difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried perhaps that was why he didnt try and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat i wish ye wasnt goin away he said in a husky voice
then he winked his eyes again then he looked at mister havisham and touched his cap thanky sir fur bringin him down here an fur wot yeve done hes hes a queer little feller he added ive allers thort a heap of him
hes such a game little feller an an such a queer little un and when they turned away he stood and looked after them in a dazed kind of way and there was still a mist in his eyes and a lump in his throat
as he watched the gallant little figure marching gayly along by the side of its tall rigid escort until the day of his departure his lordship spent as much time as possible with mister hobbs in the store
gloom had settled upon mister hobbs he was much depressed in spirits when his young friend brought to him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and chain mister hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it properly
he laid the case on his stout knee and blew his nose violently several times theres something written on it said cedric inside the case i told the man myself what to say
from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mister hobbs when this you see remember me i dont want you to forget me mister hobbs blew his nose very loudly again
i shant forget you he said speaking a trifle huskily as dick had spoken nor dont you go and forget me when you get among the british arrystocracy
i shouldnt forget you whoever i was among answered his lordship ive spent my happiest hours with you at least some of my happiest hours i hope youll come to see me sometime
id come to see you replied mister hobbs graciously so it seemed to be agreed that if he received a pressing invitation from the earl to come and spend a few months at dorincourt castle
when the carriage stood at the door then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon the little boy his mamma had been shut up in her room for some time when she came down the stairs her eyes looked large and wet and her sweet mouth was trembling
cedric went to her and she bent down to him and he put his arms around her and they kissed each other he knew something made them both sorry though he scarcely knew what it was but one tender little thought rose to his lips
we liked this little house dearest didnt we he said we always will like it wont we yes yes she answered in a low sweet voice yes darling
it seemed almost directly they were on the steamer in the midst of the wildest bustle and confusion carriages were driving down and leaving passengers passengers were getting into a state of excitement about baggage which had not arrived and threatened to be too late
big trunks and cases were being bumped down and dragged about sailors were uncoiling ropes and hurrying to and fro officers were giving orders ladies and gentlemen and children and nurses were coming on board
he looked at the piles of rope at the furled sails at the tall tall masts which seemed almost to touch the hot blue sky he began to make plans for conversing with the sailors and gaining some information on the subject of pirates
it was just at the very last when he was standing leaning on the railing of the upper deck and watching the final preparations enjoying the excitement and the shouts of the sailors and wharfmen
he came up to cedric quite breathless ive run all the way he said ive come down to see ye off trades been prime
ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells i lost the paper when i was tryin to get through them fellers downstairs
its a hankercher he poured it all forth as if in one sentence a bell rang and he made a leap away before cedric had time to speak good bye he panted wear it when ye get among the swells and he darted off and was gone
a few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck and rush on shore just before the gang plank was drawn in he stood on the wharf and waved his cap cedric held the handkerchief in his hand
it was of bright red silk ornamented with purple horseshoes and horses heads there was a great straining and creaking and confusion the people on the wharf began to shout to their friends and the people on the steamer shouted back
every one seemed to be saying dont forget us write when you get to liverpool good bye good bye little lord fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief
and he heard nothing but the hearty childish voice calling
of course as soon as the story of lord fauntleroy and the difficulties of the earl of dorincourt were discussed in the english newspapers they were discussed in the american newspapers the story was too interesting to be passed over lightly
one said he was engaged to a young lady of great beauty who was the daughter of a duke another said he had just been married the only thing in fact which was not said was that he was a little boy between seven and eight
with handsome legs and curly hair one said he was no relation to the earl of dorincourt at all but was a small impostor who had sold newspapers and slept in the streets of new york before his mother imposed upon the family lawyer
who came to america to look for the earls heir then came the descriptions of the new lord fauntleroy and his mother sometimes she was a gypsy sometimes an actress sometimes a beautiful spaniard
but it was always agreed that the earl of dorincourt was her deadly enemy and would not acknowledge her son as his heir if he could help it and as there seemed to be some slight flaw in the papers she had produced
it was expected that there would be a long trial which would be far more interesting than anything ever carried into court before mister hobbs used to read the papers until his head was in a whirl and in the evening he and dick would talk it all over
the more excited they became seems like somethin orter be done said mister hobbs things like them orter be held on to earls or no earls but there really was nothing they could do
but each write a letter to cedric containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy they wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news and after having written them they handed them over to each other to be read
this is what mister hobbs read in dicks letter dere frend
an we say hold on as longs u kin
there is a lot of ole theves wil make al they kin of u
an if there aint no better way cum over here an go in pardners with me
an ile see no harm cums to u enny big feler that trise to cum it over u
so no more at present dick
i believe its a put up job and them thats done it ought to be looked after sharp and what i write to say is two things
and if the worst happens and them earls is too many for us theres a partnership in the grocery business ready for you when yure old enough and a home and a friend in
silas hobbs well said mister hobbs hes pervided for between us if he aint a earl so he is said dick id ha stood by him blest if i didnt like that little feller fust rate
the very next morning one of dicks customers was rather surprised he was a young lawyer just beginning practice as poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be
but a bright energetic young fellow with sharp wit and a good temper he had a shabby office near dicks stand and every morning dick blacked his boots for him and quite often they were not exactly water tight but he always had a friendly word or a joke for dick
and dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open and his sharp face almost pale with excitement whats to pay dick said the young man what has paralyzed you dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened
my i know her better n i know you the young man began to laugh where did you meet her dick he said at newport or when you ran over to paris the last time dick actually forgot to grin
he began to gather his brushes and things together as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present never mind he said i know her an ive struck work for this mornin
mister hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw dick rush in with the paper in his hand the boy was out of breath with running so much out of breath in fact that he could scarcely speak
as he threw the paper down on the counter hello
look at it panted dick
thats what you look at she aint no ristocrat she aint with withering scorn shes no lords wife
thats who done it she was allers up to her tricks an ill tell yer wot come to me the minnit i saw her pictur there was one o them papers we saw had a letter in it that said somethin bout her boy an it said he had a scar on his chin
put them two together her n that there scar why that there boy o hers aint no more a lord than i am its bens boy the little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me
professor dick tipton had always been a sharp boy and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper he had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him
and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment if little lord fauntleroy could only have looked into the store that morning he would certainly have been interested
the feller that give me the paper hes a lawyer lets ax him what wed better do lawyers knows it all mister hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and dicks business capacity
thats so he replied this here calls for lawyers and leaving the store in the care of a substitute he struggled into his coat and marched down town with dick and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in mister harrisons office
much to that young mans astonishment if he had not been a very young lawyer with a very enterprising mind and a great deal of spare time on his hands he might not have been so readily interested in what they had to say
for it all certainly sounded very wild and queer but he chanced to want something to do very much and he chanced to know dick and dick chanced to say his say in a very sharp telling sort of way
it appears there has been some dubiousness about the child the woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age and aroused suspicion the first persons to be written to are dicks brother and the earl of dorincourts family lawyer
and actually before the sun went down two letters had been written and sent in two different directions one speeding out of new york harbor on a mail steamer on its way to england and the other on a train carrying letters and passengers bound for california
and the second to benjamin tipton
it ofttimes requires heroic courage to face fruitless effort to take up the broken strands of a life work to look bravely toward the future and proceed undaunted on our way
but what to our eyes may seem hopeless failure is often but the dawning of a greater success it may contain in its debris the foundation material of a mighty purpose or the revelation of new and higher possibilities
some years ago it was proposed to send logs from canada to new york by a new method the ingenious plan of mister joggins was to bind great logs together by cables and iron girders
and the angry waters scattered the logs far and wide the chief of the hydrographic department at washington heard of the failure of the experiment and at once sent word to shipmasters the world over
urging them to watch carefully for these logs which he described and to note the precise location of each in latitude and longitude and the time the observation was made hundreds of captains sailing over the waters of the earth
noted the logs in the atlantic ocean in the mediterranean in the south seas for into all waters did these venturesome ones travel hundreds of reports were made covering a period of weeks and months
these observations were then carefully collated systematized and tabulated and discoveries were made as to the course of ocean currents that otherwise would have been impossible the loss of the joggins raft was not a real failure
for it led to one of the great discoveries in modern marine geography and navigation in our superior knowledge we are disposed to speak in a patronizing tone
but their failure to transmute the baser metals into gold resulted in the birth of chemistry they did not succeed in what they attempted but they brought into vogue the natural processes of sublimation filtration
distillation and crystallization they invented the alembic the retort the sand bath the water bath and other valuable instruments to them is due the discovery of antimony sulphuric ether and phosphorus
and its use in gunpowder and the discovery of the distillation of essential oils this was the success of failure a wondrous process of nature for the highest growth a mighty lesson of comfort strength and encouragement
in discovering america columbus failed absolutely his ingenious reasoning and experiment led him to believe that by sailing westward he would reach india every redman in america carries in his name indian
the perpetuation of the memory of the failure of columbus the genoese navigator did not reach india the cargo of souvenirs he took back to spain to show to ferdinand and isabella as proofs of his success
really attested his failure but the discovery of america was a greater success than was any finding of a back door to india when david livingstone had supplemented his theological education by a medical course
opened a whole continent to light and truth his study proved an ideal preparation for his labors as physician explorer teacher and evangel in the wilds of africa
business reverses and the failure of his partner threw upon the broad shoulders and the still broader honor and honesty of sir walter scott a burden of responsibility that forced him to write
his brush strokes put on in the early morning hours before going to his menial duties as a railway porter in the dusk like that perpetuated on his canvas meant strength food and medicine for the dying wife he adored
the art failure that cast him into the depths of poverty unified with marvellous intensity all the finer elements of his nature this rare spiritual unity
this purging of all the dross of triviality as he passed through the furnace of poverty trial and sorrow gave eloquence to his brush and enabled him to paint as never before as no prosperity would have made possible
failure is often the turning point the pivot of circumstance that swings us to higher levels it may not be financial success it may not be fame it may be new draughts of spiritual moral or mental inspiration
there is but one question for him to answer to face boldly and honestly as an individual alone with his conscience and his destiny how will i let that poverty or wealth affect me if that trial or deprivation has left me better
truer nobler then poverty has been riches failure has been a success if wealth has come to me and has made me vain arrogant contemptuous uncharitable cynical
it has not been riches it has been dark treacherous poverty that stole from me even myself all things become for us then what we take from them failure is one of gods educators
it is experience leading man to higher things it is the revelation of a way a path hitherto unknown to us the best men in the world those who have made the greatest real successes
look back with serene happiness on their failures the turning of the face of time shows all things in a wondrously illuminated and satisfying perspective many a man is thankful to day that some petty success for which he once struggled
melted into thin air as his hand sought to clutch it failure is often the rock bottom foundation of real success if man in a few instances of his life can say
the death or destruction of the seed is the prelude to its resurrection as wheat it is at night in the darkest hours those preceding dawn that plants grow best that they most increase in size
may this not be one of natures gentle showings to man of the times when he grows best of the darkness of failure that is evolving into the sunlight of success let us fear only the failure of not living the right as we see it
leaving the results to the guardianship of the infinite if we think of any supreme moment of our lives any great success any one who is dear to us and then consider how we reached that moment that success
we will see how logical has been the course of our joy and success from sorrow and failure and that what gives us most happiness to day is inextricably connected with what once caused us sorrow
have had their source and their trickling increase into volume among the dark gloomy recesses of our failure there is no honest and true work
in continuous harmony with them
no matter what statistics of failure a near sighted and half blind world of critics and commentators may lay at his door high ideals noble efforts will make seeming failures but trifles
they need not dishearten us they should prove sources of new strength the rocky way may prove safer than the slippery path of smoothness birds cannot fly best with the wind but against it ships do not progress in calm
when the sails flap idly against the unstrained masts
is to explore various views which are held by leading authorities at present it can be said however that a majority of authorities agree that hypnosis ensues as a result of natural laws
which have been incorporated in the human organism since the beginning of man as he is today the older theories show almost as much disparity as today but for the purposes of history
both names loom large in the history of hypnosis mesmer an eighteenth century physician believed that hypnosis occurred as a result of vital fluids drawn from a magnet or lodestone
and which drew their unique qualities from the sun moon and stars charcot
was convinced that hypnosis was a form of hysteria and that only hysterics could be hypnotized the former mesmer thought further that metal became imbued by the solar qualities and his system is also known as metalogy
notably doctor william s kroger a psychiatrically oriented obstetrician and gynecologist who limits his practice to hypnotherapy believe hypnosis is a conviction phenomenon which produces results that parallel the phenomena
produced at lourdes and other religious healing shrines his formula is that faith hope belief and expectation all catalyzed by the imagination lead inevitably to hypnosis
is convinced that you cannot will yourself to be hypnotized and that whenever the will and the imagination come into conflict
this fits in perfectly of course with the authors already discussed visual imagery technique which requires a high degree of imagination doctor kroger like a few others has proved to his own satisfaction that all hypnotic phenomena
can be produced at a non hypnotic level a large number of hypnotists including the author has come to believe that hypnosis is a semantic problem in which words are the building blocks to success not just any words
but words which ring a bell or tap the experiential background of the subject
the word is used because hypnosis superficially resembles sleep inasmuch as the eyes usually are closed the body in a posture of complete relaxation actually the mind is hyperacute
on the other hand we know that a strong interpersonal relationship is necessary for hypnosis in the opening chapter of the book i explained that hypnosis was a state of heightened suggestion in which the subject adopted an uncritical attitude
allowing him to accept suggestions and to take appropriate action this is excellent as far as it goes but it does not explain how suggestion works this is the crux of the hypnotic dilemma and the answer is far from solved
hypnotists are much like those who use electricity every day of their lives but have no idea of the nature of electricity it is enough for them to know it has been harnessed for their use
if there is one thing virtually certain about hypnosis it is that some parts of the brain are inhibited and other parts expanded by the process
but why is this high order of concentration so easy under hypnosis when asians notably the chinese have been trying for centuries to concentrate on one subject for as long as four or five seconds
we do not know the mechanics of this metamorphosis of an ordinary brain into an organ of concentrated power according to janet this is accomplished through the formation of a group of unconscious memories and activities
which takes over the usual stream of consciousness type of thinking it is implied that the process may be atavistic one of the newer theories one held by doctor lewis r wolberg a psychoanalyst
and a limitation of sensory channels such as takes place in sleep he also believes that the psychological process operates through transference others agree that it is a transference process
but that it is more of an extension of the subjects own psychic processes which is enlarged to include the voice of the hypnotist or his own thoughts or voice incidentally an excellent book along these theoretical lines is hypnotism
actually hypnotists today
milton v kline professor of psychology at long island university postulates that hypnosis is primarily retrogressive he has written that the organism functions differently on various levels of behavior regression
this is a legitimate use of regression although it is not used so much these days to uncover past traumatic incidents actually regression by duplicating the exact earlier age
makes us once more as little children a condition to be desired for certain forms of therapy an atavistic theory held to some extent by doctor jerome m schneck clinical associate professor of psychiatry
state university of new york college of medicine is that hypnosis should be equated with states of immobilization on the basis of his observation that some subjects equate hypnosis with death
of animals to avoid danger others primarily europeans have pointed out the analogy between the hypnotic state of animals and man another widely held theory is that hypnosis is a state of dissociation
meaning that it constitutes a group of unconscious memories and activities which may be dredged up to replace the stream of consciousness automaticism of course is inherently part of this view and is presumed to negate volition activity of the cerebrum
which controls the conscious and voluntary system is rendered non operational my own thoughts on the matter are that hypnosis results from first of all a good transference secondly from a conditioned reflex
thirdly from the person acting as a hypnotized person role playing and fourthly from a suspension of the critical faculties along the last named line i believe that hypnotic suggestions
which supersede all else in the hypnotic situation there are many more theories i believe are partially correct but the ones named will do for the purposes of this volume incidentally
are equally applicable to self hypnosis except where as in transference it is obvious a therapist is needed in conclusion the author would like to take issue with those
where hypnotherapy is impossible like the man who cannot sleep because of an active mind sleep and myriad thoughts and suggestions are incompatible and i believe once a hypnotic state has been attained that the subject is kept awake
unless definite sleep suggestions are given by the therapists series of suggestions we have discussed the effect of the experiential background at length and surely nothing connotates sleep more than closing ones eyes
and so in my view
supreme control of age youth is eternal nature never grows old the flowers that bloomed in eden are blooming to day just as lovely just as sweet
just as fresh and unchanged the roses your life mate brings home to you have the same fragrance as the roses adam brought to eve if he thought of it
warmed mother earth into vernal spring life are the same life giving rays that shall bring again the spring tide life never grows old it only changes form your life is perpetual
then your youth may be perpetual the human race is ever young its units fall off you should be younger at sixty than at sixteen
growing old is a habit people travel along the years up the hill of life till they reach a certain point where they begin to think they must be growing old think its time to sag think its time to droop
think its time to begin the process of decay then begin to talk about it to write letters about it to feel around for it to look for it in others finally the habit they inherited from the race is on
and they are old life is endless but you can think it short the power of an endless life is within you but by thinking you can turn it to the white ashes of old age think youth
and you stay young youth is growth keep growing and you keep young a new idea will make you feel younger develop it and it will develop you quicken your mental throb with new ideas
begin now stop talking about being too old to grow you pass by trees daily a hundred
the rose bush on a wall in china is supposed to be over a thousand years old it bears more roses now than when it was a mere slip of a vine of only one hundred
gladstone at eighty two was a growing statesman and elected prime minister of england for the fourth time cato at eighty began to study greek and renewed the youth of his mind donald davis
is a growing hunter at one hundred and three goddard diamond was a growing teacher of health when he was one hundred and eleven i know a bright cheery lady
who is just beginning a new study for decorating china along with her household cares and she is eighty eight also another woman who has taken up a new process of enlarging drawings into water colors
and she is eighty one years young the fig tree withered when the master of life found it not growing producing creating when you stop growing you will wither by the same law grow something create something
the law of production the law of expression the law of beauty the law of selflessness keep your bodily forces up rebuild destroyed tissue keep the system free of waste
stop poisoning your body with anger hate jealousy fear keep your mind sweet think cheerfully avoid mental turmoil and excitement two great enemies of youth are worry and fear
the next is selfishness think every morning when you rise this new day is new life it is fresh from the hand of god it is mine to use i will increase it unto the perfect day
grow in each day and make each day grow check discord quit useless discussion for it weakens and withers stop quarreling check complainings root criticism out of your life
you are bigger than these things get into harmony you are of the world upon worlds universe unto universe study your words to make them have beauty your walk to have grace
your personality to make it magnetic your smile to give courage and comfort your presence to have it healing helping inspiring if there be any virtue in whatsoever things are lovely
think on those things youth is loving work like what you do do what makes you and others happy enter your daily work with joy adjust it until you do like it
learn to love work for the happiness it brings put joy into your work in the morning and you will find it multiplied into happiness at night work is a law of youth inaction is decay
inertia is death men and women do not usually lose their positions they drive their positions away from them the law of work will not stand personal abuse
any more than the law of beauty will endure brutality form an ideal of your work make a mental picture of it simplify it orderly it beautify it then glorify it
and work with confident expectation put rules and system into your daily task exercise your self control your self possession self mastery march up to your task with efficiency
put invincible determination i will into your complex problem put irresistible confidence i shall achieve into your ardent desires you will then love work
love is the fulfilling of the law youth is supreme cheerfulness to be funless is to be lifeless good cheer is the tonic of youth if you are so sad you cannot laugh at something
bathe in mirth frolic in some sunshine daily even if you live in pittsburgh and have to make your own sunshine make fun dont always buy it you can cure disease and kill the devil with laughter
cultivate an infectious laugh mirth makes work easy read humor and learn to tell it practice telling a good funny story be a quick wit there is a bright side to everything in this world
even to a dark lantern the end of the film is sure to be jolly good cheer attracts good luck cheer up if you havent a smile get one of somebody and wear it as your own
let thine heart cheer thee give it out let go to sleep with a smile on your face and you will awaken with a joy in your heart let your humor be rich humor laughter is the cipher key to a man
it is one of the most delightful sounds of earth most utterly lost is the day you laugh not mirth clears the mirrors of the mind a person who does not laugh is not healthy
like a medicine to forget your sorrow begin to cultivate joy keep away from sad people or you will be sad stop rehearsing your grief you only enlarge it if you suffer grief
find someone in trouble and cheer them encourage them help them and you will deliver yourself you will comfort yourself when you comfort another you cannot lose a loved one tho absent from the earth plane
they are nearer than ever life and love never change death is an unreality thought made
that is glorified in life and spirit when you believe you were created in his image
it is easier to believe you shall arise in his likeness some day we shall all believe we have not disfigured morally broken natures but divine natures supreme in limitless power
traditions teachings education environment of generations of thinking have disfigured morally broken sin burdened humanity all are thought created conditions thought made limitations
thought made original sins system cultivated human wrongs institutionalized teachings of error but you should know the universe is one undivided soul you are a yoke fellow with god
you are a lobe of the infinite brain
of absolute personality nothing that has life is god damned where love is only a dream the marriage is an alarm clock if you cannot endure your mother in law
you can begin your plans at once to live alone when your children are married a quarrel between two people to settle things is a good deal like a dog fight in a flower bed the only things that get settled are the flowers
nearly always when you hear the lusty wail of a boy with energy plus filling the air you can look in at the window and find a womans hand at the seat of his trouble you can over work your notion of neatness
chapter fourteen in derycks safe control the white cliffs of dover gradually became more solid and distinct until at length they rose from the sea a strong white wall
emblem of the undeniable purity of england the stainless honour and integrity of her throne her church her parliament her courts of justice and her dealings at home and abroad whether with friend or foe
strength and whiteness thought jane as she paced the steamers deck and after a two years absence her heart went out to her native land then dover castle caught her eye so beautiful in the pearly light of that spring afternoon
an hour after she had read it she was driving down the long straight road to cairo embarked at alexandria the next day landed at brindisi
and this night and day travelling had brought her at last within sight of the shores of england in a few minutes she would set foot upon them and then there would be but two more stages to her journey for from the moment she started
jane never doubted her ultimate destination the room where pain and darkness and despair must be waging so terrible a conflict against the moral courage the mental sanity and the instinctive hold on life of the man she loved
that she was going to him jane knew but she felt utterly unable to arrange how or in what way her going could be managed that it was a complicated problem her common sense told her
and that her surest way to garth lay through the doctors consulting room so she telegraphed to deryck from paris and at present her mind saw no further than wimpole street at dover she bought a paper
and hastily scanned its pages as she walked along the platform in the wake of the capable porter who had taken possession of her rugs and hand baggage in the personal column she found the very paragraph she sought
but the injured parts were progressing favourably and all fear of brain complications seemed over during the last few days however a serious reaction from shock has set in and it has been considered necessary to summon sir deryck brand
the well known nerve specialist in consultation with the oculist and the local practitioner in charge of the case there is a feeling of wide spread regret and sympathy in those social and artistic circles where mister dalmain was so well known and so deservedly popular
that janes half crown was not a penny he had a sick young wife at home who had been ordered extra nourishment and just as the rush on board began he had put up a simple prayer to the heavenly father
who knoweth that ye have need of these things asking that he might catch the eye of a generous traveller he felt he had indeed been led to this plain brown faced broad shouldered lady when he remembered how nearly
after her curt nod from a distance had engaged him he had responded to the blandishments of a fussy little woman with many more bags and rugs and a parrot cage who was now doling french coppers out of the window of the next compartment
seven pence apenny of this stuff aint much for carrying all that along i dont think grumbled his mate and janes young porter experienced the double joy of faith confirmed and willing service generously rewarded a telegraph boy walked along the train saying
have coffee at dover deryck jane gave one hard tearless sob of thankfulness and relief she had been so lonely then she turned to the window here somebody fetch me a cup of coffee will you
and just as the train began to move handed a cup of steaming coffee and a plate of bread and butter in at the window oh thank you my good fellow said jane putting the plate on the seat while she dived into her pocket
here you have done very well for me no never mind the change coffee at a moments notice should fetch a fancy price good bye the train moved on and the porter stood looking after it with tears in his eyes
over the first half crown he had said to himself milk and new laid eggs now as he pocketed the second he added the other two things mentioned by the parish doctor soup and jelly and his heart glowed
your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of these things and jane seated in a comfortable corner choked back the tears of relief which threatened to fall drank her coffee and was thereby more revived than she could have thought possible
she read his telegram through once more and smiled how like him to think of the coffee and oh how like him to be coming to the station she took off her hat and leaned back against the cushions
she had been travelling night and day in one feverish whirl of haste and at last she had brought herself within reach of derycks hand and derycks safe control the turmoil of her soul was stilled
a great calm took its place and jane dropped quietly off to sleep your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of these things washed and brushed and greatly refreshed
jane stood at the window of her compartment as the train steamed into charing cross the doctor was stationed exactly opposite the door when her carriage came to a standstill
mere chance and yet to jane it seemed so like him to have taken up his position precisely at the right spot on that long platform an enthusiastic lady patient had once said of deryck brand with more accuracy of definition than of grammar
you know he is always so very just there and this characteristic of the doctor had made him to many a very present help in time of trouble he was through the line of porters and had his hand upon the handle of janes door in a moment
standing at the window she took one look at the firm lean face now alight with welcome and read in the kind steadfast eyes of her childhoods friend a perfect sympathy and comprehension then she saw behind him her aunts footman
and her own maid who had been given a place in the duchesss household in another moment she was on the platform and her hand was in derycks that is right dear he said all fit and well i can see now hand over your keys
i suppose you have nothing contraband i telephoned the duchess to send some of her people to meet your luggage and not to expect you herself until dinner time as you were taking tea with us was that right this way come outside the barrier what a rabble
all wanting to break every possible rule and regulation and each trying to be the first person in the front row really the patience and good temper of railway officials should teach the rest of mankind a lesson the doctor talking all the time
piloted jane through the crowd opened the door of a neat electric brougham helped her in took his seat beside her and they glided swiftly out into the strand and turned towards trafalgar square
well said the doctor niagara is a big thing isnt it when people say to me were you not disappointed in niagara we were i feel tempted to wish for one homicidal moment that the earth would open her mouth and swallow them up
people who can be disappointed in niagara and talk about it should no longer be allowed to crawl on the face of the earth and how about the little mother isnt she worth knowing i hope she sent me her love and new york harbour
he will always be blind dear but life holds other things beside sight we must never say no hope will he live there is no reason he should not live
but how far life will be worth living largely depends upon what can be done for him poor chap during the next few months he is more shattered mentally than physically
when all were gone i learnt that the vile slander had indeed been circulated throughout the company in the very presence of the victim rose however vowed she did not and would not believe it
and my mother made the same declaration though not i fear with the same amount of real unwavering incredulity it seemed to dwell continually on her mind and she kept irritating me from time to time by such expressions as
the foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world said i and in the fact that mister lawrence has been seen to go that way once or twice of an evening and the village gossips say he goes to pay his addresses to the strange lady
and the scandal mongers have greedily seized the rumour to make it the basis of their own infernal structure well but gilbert there must be something in her manner to countenance such reports did you see anything in her manner
no certainly but then you know i always said there was something strange about her i believe it was on that very evening that i ventured on another invasion of wildfell hall from the time of our party
which was upwards of a week ago i had been making daily efforts to meet its mistress in her walks and always disappointed she must have managed it so on purpose had nightly kept revolving in my mind some pretext for another call
at length i concluded that the separation could be endured no longer by this time you will see i was pretty far gone and taking from the book case an old volume that i thought she might be interested in
though from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated condition i had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal i hastened away but not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me
or how i could summon courage to present myself with so slight an excuse but perhaps i might see her in the field or the garden and then there would be no great difficulty it was the formal knocking at the door
with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by rachel to the presence of a surprised uncordial mistress that so greatly disturbed me my wish however was not gratified
missus graham herself was not to be seen but there was arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in the garden i looked over the gate and called him to me he wanted me to come in but i told him i could not without his mothers leave
he ran to perform my bidding and quickly returned with his mother how lovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer breeze her fair cheek slightly flushed and her countenance radiant with smiles
there is no mediator like a merry simple hearted child ever ready to cement divided hearts to span the unfriendly gulf of custom to melt the ice of cold reserve and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality and pride
well mister markham what is it said the young mother accosting me with a pleasant smile i want you to look at this book and if you please to take it and peruse it at your leisure
i make no apology for calling you out on such a lovely evening though it be for a matter of no greater importance tell him to come in mamma said arthur would you like to come in asked the lady yes
i should like to see your improvements in the garden and how your sisters roots have prospered in my charge added she as she opened the gate and we sauntered through the garden and talked of the flowers the trees and the book
and then of other things the evening was kind and genial and so was my companion by degrees i waxed more warm and tender than perhaps i had ever been before
but still i said nothing tangible and she attempted no repulse until in passing a moss rose tree that i had brought her some weeks since in my sisters name
and i saw a flash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye a glow of glad excitement on her face i thought my hour of victory was come but instantly a painful recollection seemed to flash upon her
a cloud of anguish darkened her brow a marble paleness blanched her cheek and lip there seemed a moment of inward conflict and with a sudden effort she withdrew her hand and retreated a step or two back
now mister markham said she with a kind of desperate calmness i must tell you plainly that i cannot do with this i like your company because i am alone here
and let me alone hereafter in fact we must be strangers for the future i will then be your friend or brother or anything you wish if you will only let me continue to see you but tell me why i cannot be anything more
there was a perplexed and thoughtful pause is it in consequence of some rash vow it is something of the kind she answered some day i may tell you but at present you had better leave me
and never gilbert put me to the painful necessity of repeating what i have just now said to you she earnestly added giving me her hand in serious kindness how sweet how musical my own name sounded in her mouth
i will not i replied but you pardon this offence on condition that you never repeat it and may i come to see you now and then perhaps occasionally
provided you never abuse the privilege i make no empty promises but you shall see the moment you do our intimacy is at an end thats all and will you always call me gilbert
but as i went the tramp of horses hoofs fell on my ear and broke the stillness of the dewy evening and looking towards the lane i saw a solitary equestrian coming up inclining to dusk as it was
and seemed inclined to turn back but on second thought apparently judged it better to continue his course as before he accosted me with a slight bow and edging close to the wall endeavoured to pass on but i was not so minded
you and your pony be what makes you so coarse and brutal markham im quite ashamed of you you answer my questions before you leave this spot i will know what you mean by this perfidious duplicity
if you stand till morning now then said i unclosing my hand but still standing before him ask me some other time when you can speak like a gentleman returned he and he made an effort to pass me again
but i quickly re captured the pony scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage really mister markham this is too much said the latter can i not go to see my tenant on matters of business without being assaulted in this manner by
and in truth the vicar was just behind me plodding homeward from some remote corner of his parish i immediately released the squire and he went on his way saluting mister millward as he passed
what quarrelling markham cried the latter addressing himself to me
but let me tell you young man here he put his face into mine with an important confidential air shes not worth it and he confirmed the assertion by a solemn nod
with a look that plainly said what this to me
you must suppose about three weeks passed over missus graham and i were now established friends or brother and sister as we rather chose to consider ourselves
she called me gilbert by my express desire and i called her helen for i had seen that name written in her books i seldom attempted to see her above twice a week
and still i made our meetings appear the result of accident as often as i could for i found it necessary to be extremely careful and altogether i behaved with such exceeding propriety that she never had occasion to reprove me once
yet i could not but perceive that she was at times unhappy and dissatisfied with herself or her position and truly i myself was not quite contented with the latter this assumption of brotherly nonchalance was very hard to sustain
and i often felt myself a most confounded hypocrite with it all i saw too or rather i felt that in spite of herself i was not indifferent to her as the novel heroes modestly express it
and while i thankfully enjoyed my present good fortune i could not fail to wish and hope for something better in future but of course i kept such dreams entirely to myself
youre going to wildfell hall arent you what makes you think so because you look as if you were but i wish you wouldnt go so often nonsense child i dont go once in six weeks what do you mean
well but if i were you i wouldnt have so much to do with missus graham why rose are you too giving in to the prevailing opinion no returned she hesitatingly
both at the wilsons and the vicarage and besides mamma says if she were a proper person she would not be living there by herself and dont you remember last winter gilbert all that about the false name to the picture
and how she explained it saying she had friends or acquaintances from whom she wished her present residence to be concealed and that she was afraid of their tracing her out and then how suddenly she started up and left the room when that person came
whom she took good care not to let us catch a glimpse of and who arthur with such an air of mystery told us was his mammas friend yes rose i remember it all and i can forgive your uncharitable conclusions
for perhaps if i did not know her myself i should put all these things together and believe the same as you do but thank god i do know her and i should be unworthy the name of a man if i could believe anything that was said against her
unless i heard it from her own lips i should as soon believe such things of you rose oh gilbert well
you know nothing of her former life and last year at this time you did not know that such a person existed no matter there is such a thing as looking through a persons eyes into the heart and learning more of the height and breadth
and depth of anothers soul in one hour than it might take you a lifetime to discover if he or she were not disposed to reveal it or if you had not the sense to understand it then you are going to see her this evening
missus graham and i are two friends and will be and no man breathing shall hinder it or has a right to interfere between us but if you knew how they talk you would be more careful for her sake as well as for your own
jane wilson thinks your visits to the old hall but another proof of her depravity confound jane wilson and eliza millward is quite grieved about you i hope she is
but i wouldnt if i were you wouldnt what how do they know that i go there theres nothing hid from them they spy out everything oh i never thought of this
and so they dare to turn my friendship into food for further scandal against her that proves the falsehood of their other lies at all events if any proof were wanting mind you contradict them rose whenever you can
but they dont speak openly to me about such things it is only by hints and innuendoes and by what i hear others say that i knew what they think well then i wont go to day as its getting latish
after his customary cheerful and fatherly greeting of rose who was rather a favourite with the old gentleman he turned somewhat sternly to me well sir said he youre quite a stranger it is
as he deposited his ponderous bulk in the arm chair that rose officiously brought towards him it is just six weeks by my reckoning since you darkened my door he spoke it with emphasis and struck his stick on the floor
is it sir said i ay it is so he added an affirmatory nod and continued to gaze upon me with a kind of irate solemnity holding his substantial stick between his knees
with his hands clasped upon its head i have been busy i said for an apology was evidently demanded busy repeated he derisively yes you know ive been getting in my hay
in time for tea but offered to have some immediately prepared if he would do her the favour to partake of it not any for me i thank you replied he i shall be at home in a few minutes oh but do stay and take a little
it will be ready in five minutes but he rejected the offer with a majestic wave of the hand ill tell you what ill take missus markham said he ill take a glass of your excellent ale
with pleasure cried my mother proceeding with alacrity to pull the bell and order the favoured beverage i thought continued he id just look in upon you as i passed and taste your home brewed ale
really ejaculated my mother why so mister millward asked i he looked at me with some severity and turning again to my mother repeated
and struck his stick on the floor again my mother sat opposite an awe struck but admiring auditor missus graham said i he continued shaking his head as he spoke
these are terrible reports what sir says she affecting to be ignorant of my meaning it is my duty as your pastor said i to tell you both everything that i myself see reprehensible in your conduct
and all i have reason to suspect and what others tell me concerning you so i told her you did sir cried i starting from my seat and striking my fist on the table
but she offered no extenuation or defence and with a kind of shameless calmness shocking indeed to witness in one so young as good as told me that my remonstrance was unavailing and my pastoral advice quite thrown away upon her
nay that my very presence was displeasing while i spoke such things and i withdrew at length too plainly seeing that nothing could be done and sadly grieved to find her case so hopeless
but i am fully determined missus markham that my daughters shall not consort with her do you adopt the same resolution with regard to yours as for your sons as for you young man he continued sternly turning to me
slamming the door behind me with a bang that shook the house to its foundations and made my mother scream and gave a momentary relief to my excited feelings
the next minute saw me hurrying with rapid strides in the direction of wildfell hall to what intent or purpose i could scarcely tell but i must be moving somewhere and no other goal would do
i must see her too and speak to her that was certain but what to say or how to act i had no definite idea
the huns had a famous king named atti la he was only twenty one years old when he became their king but although he was young he was very brave and ambitious and he wanted to be a great and powerful king not far from attilas palace
there was a great rocky cave in the mountains in this cave lived a strange man called the hermit of the rocks
he was very old with wrinkled face and long gray hair and beard many persons believed that he was a fortune teller so people often went to him to inquire what was to happen to them
one day shortly after he became king attila went to the cave to get his fortune told wise man said he look into the future and tell me what is before me in the path of life the hermit thought for a few moments and then said
o king i see you a famous conqueror the master of many nations i see you going from country to country defeating armies and destroying cities until men call you the fear of the world you heap up vast riches
but he was young and full of spirit and very soon he remembered only what had been said to him about his becoming a great and famous conqueror and began to prepare for war he gathered together the best men
from the various tribes of his people and trained them into a great army of good soldiers two about this time one of the kings shepherds while taking care of cattle in the fields
noticed blood dripping from the foot of one of the oxen the shepherd followed the streak of blood through the grass and at last found the sharp point of a sword sticking out of the earth he dug out the weapon carried it to the palace
as long as i fight with the sword of tiew as soon as his army was ready he marched with it into countries which belonged to rome he defeated the romans in several great battles and captured many of their cities
the roman emperor theodosius had to ask for terms of peace attila agreed that there should be peace but soon afterwards he found out that theodosius had formed a plot to murder him
he was so enraged at this that he again began war
and at last the emperor had to give him a large sum of money
this made peace but the peace did not last long in a few years attila appeared at the head of an army of seven hundred thousand men with this great force he marched across germany and into gaul
he attacked and destroyed towns and killed the inhabitants without mercy the people had such dread of him that he was called the scourge of god and the fear of the world three
attila and his terrible huns marched through gaul until they came to the city of orleans here the people bravely resisted the invaders they shut their gates and defended themselves in every way they could
in those times all towns of any great size were surrounded by strong walls there was war constantly going on
who lived by robbing their neighbors so the towns and castles in which there was
were not safe without high and strong walls attila tried to take orleans but soon after he began to attack the walls he saw a great army at a distance coming towards the city
the army which attila saw was an army of three hundred thousand romans and visigoths it was led by a roman general
the visigoths after the death of
had settled in parts of gaul and their king had now agreed to join the romans against the common enemy the terrible huns so the great army of the romans and visigoths
thoris mond the son of theodoric
when his father was killed and now he led them on to fight they were all eager to have revenge for the death of their king so they fought like lions and swept across the plain with great fury the huns were soon beaten on every side
and attila himself fled to his camp it was the first time he had ever been defeated thorismond the conqueror was lifted upon his shield on the battle field and hailed as king of the visigoths
when attila reached his camp he had all his baggage and wagons gathered in a great heap he intended to set fire to it and jump into the flames if the romans should come there to attack him
here i will perish in the flames he cried rather than surrender to my enemies
very soon however he was again on the war path this time he invaded italy
and they had no army strong enough to send against him rome would have been again destroyed if it had not been for pope leo
and persuaded him not to attack the city it is said that the barbarian king
they enclosed his body in three coffins one of gold one of silver and one of iron
when the funeral was over they killed the slaves who had dug the grave
when he was but twenty one years of age he was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very ordinary person like most of the vandals he was a cruel and cunning man but he had great ability in many ways
but a plot was formed against him
and that he was going to make war against rome at the same time he wrote secretly to count boniface and told him that if he came to rome the empress would put him to death boniface believed this story
he also sent a letter to genseric inviting him to come to africa with an army genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from boniface he had long wanted to attack rome and take from her some of the rich countries she had conquered
and marched into other parts of the coast and captured towns and cities by this time boniface had learned all about the wicked plot of aetius he now regretted having invited the vandals to africa and tried to induce them to return to spain
but genseric sternly refused never he said shall i go back to spain until i am master of africa then cried boniface i will drive you back soon afterwards there was a battle between the romans and vandals and the romans were defeated
they were also defeated in several other battles at last they had to flee for safety to two or three towns which the vandals had not yet taken one of these towns was hippo genseric captured this town
destroys valuable property a great many of the natives of africa joined the army of genseric they had for a long time been ill treated by the romans and were glad to see them defeated
he built great fleets and sailed over the mediterranean capturing trading vessels for many years he plundered towns along the coasts
after ruling several years valentinian had just been murdered by a roman noble named maximus who had at once made himself emperor when the messenger entered the room where genseric was he said great king
i bring you a message from the empress eudoxia she begs your help she and her two beautiful daughters are in danger in rome she wishes you to protect them against maximus she invites you to come with an army to rome and take the city
she and her friends will help you as much as they can with a cry of joy genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed tell the empress that i accept her invitation i shall set out for rome immediately
i shall set out for rome immediately i shall protect eudoxia and her friends genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army and sailed across the mediterranean
to the mouth of the tiber when the emperor maximus heard that the vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the city and he advised the senate to do the same the people were so angry at this
it was only forty five years since alaric had been there
but since then rome had become again grand and wealthy so there was plenty for genseric and his vandals to carry away they spent fourteen days in the work of plunder they sacked the temples
and public buildings and private houses
some years after the capture of rome by genseric there was a roman emperor named ma jori an he was a good ruler and a brave man the vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in italy
and other countries belonging to rome and majorian resolved to punish them so he got together a great army and built a fleet of three hundred ships to carry his troops to carthage
but he first marched his men across the alps through gaul and down to the seaport of carthagena in spain where his fleet was stationed he took this route because he expected to add to his forces
as he went along before sailing with his army for carthage he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people the vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was generally believed
and entertained him hospitably not knowing that he was the emperor majorian of course peace was not made the emperor left carthage after having got as much information as he could
but genseric did not wait for the roman fleet to come to attack him in his capital when he got word that it was in the bay of carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single day burned or sank nearly all the roman ships
after this the vandals became more than ever the terror of the mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it every year their ships went round the coasts from asia minor to spain attacking and plundering cities on their way
and carrying off prisoners all the efforts of the romans failed to put a stop to these ravages the emperor leo who ruled over the eastern division of the empire fitted out a great fleet at constantinople
to make another attempt to suppress the pirates there were more than a thousand ships in this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men
the brother of emperor leos wife basilicus sailed with his ships to africa and landed the army not far from carthage genseric asked for a truce for five days to consider terms of peace and the truce was granted
but the cunning vandal was not thinking of peace he only wanted time to carry out a plan he had made to destroy the roman fleet one dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his ships
in among the roman ships towing behind them large boats filled with material that would easily burn these boats were set on fire and floated against the roman vessels which also were soon on fire the flames quickly spread
and in a very short time a great part of the roman fleet was destroyed basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save and returned to constantinople this was the last attempt of the romans to conquer the vandals
in the time of clovis the country now called bulgaria was inhabited by goths one day a poor shepherd boy about sixteen years of age left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of constantinople which was many miles away
but he was determined to go even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live on fruits that he could gather by the way he was a bright clever boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager to go out into the world
to seek his fortune some years before this boys uncle who was named justin had gone to constantinople and joined the roman army he was so brave and so good a soldier that he soon came to be
commander of the imperial guard which attended the emperor the poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle and this was the reason why he resolved to set off for the big city so he started down the mountain
and trudged along the valley in high hope feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey in safety
and to cross rivers and high hills but at last one afternoon in midsummer he walked through the main gate of constantinople proud and happy that he had accomplished his purpose he had no trouble in finding his uncle justin
and gave him the best education that could be had in the city
richly dressed he was well liked at the emperors court and was respected by everybody on account of his learning two one day a great change came for both uncle and nephew the emperor died
in ruling the empire justinus agreed to this proposal for he was now old and in feeble health and not able himself to attend to the important affairs of government
justinian reigned for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he was afterwards called justinian the great he had many wars during his reign but he himself did not take part in them
he was fortunate enough however to have two great generals to lead his armies one of them was named belisarius and the other narses belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived
he gained wonderful victories for justinian and conquered some of the old roman provinces that had been lost for many years the victories of these two generals largely helped to make the reign of justinian remarkable in history
that were carried on a fleet of six hundred ships it took this fleet three months to make the voyage from constantinople to africa the same voyage may now be made in a very few days but in the time of belisarius there were no steamships
and nothing was known of the power of steam for moving machinery the ships or galleys were sailing vessels and when there was no wind they could make no progress except by rowing when belisarius reached africa
he left five men as a guard in each vessel and with the body of his army he marched for some days along the coast the people received him in a friendly way for they had grown tired of the rule of the vandals
and preferred to be under the government of the romans about ten miles from carthage he met a large army led by the brother of gelimer a battle immediately took place and the vandals were utterly defeated
gelimer gave himself up to belisarius who took him to constantinople justinian set apart an estate for him to live upon and the conquered king passed the rest of his life in peaceful retirement
after conquering the vandals justinian resolved to conquer italy which was then held by the ostrogoths a large army was got together and put under the command of belisarius and narses who immediately set out for italy
when they arrived there they marched straight to rome and after some fighting
but in a few months viti ges king of the goths appeared with an army before the gates and challenged belisarius and narses to come out and fight the roman generals however
laid siege to the city thinking that he would compel the romans to surrender but instead of having any thought of surrender belisarius was preparing his men for fight and when they were ready he attacked vitiges and defeated him
vitiges retired to ravenna and belisarius quickly followed and made such an assault on the city that it was compelled to surrender the ostrogoth army was captured
for a long time the grandest church structure in the world the great temple still exists in all its beauty and grandeur
the work for which he is most celebrated was the improving and collecting of the laws he made many excellent new laws and reformed many of the old laws so that he became famous as one of the greatest of the worlds legislators
for a long time the roman laws had been difficult to understand there was a vast number of them and different writers differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant justinian employed a great lawyer named
trib oni an to collect and simplify the principal laws the collection which he made was called the code of justinian it still exists and is the model according to which most of the countries of europe have made their laws
justinian also did a great deal of good by establishing a number of manufactures in constantinople it was he who first brought silk worms into europe to the last year of his life justinian was strong and active
and a hard worker he often worked or studied all day and all night without eating or sleeping
a great number of people in asia and africa and much of those in turkey in europe profess the mo hamme dan religion they are called mohammedans mussul mans or moslems
and the proper name for their religion is islam which means obedience or submission
a city of arabia his parents were poor people though it is said they were descended from arabian princes they died when mohammed was a child
and brought him up when the boy grew old enough he took care of his uncles sheep and camels sometimes he went on journeys with his uncle to different parts of arabia to help him in his business as a trader on these journeys mohammed used to ride on a camel
and he soon became a skillful camel driver mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work he always spoke the truth and never broke a promise i have given my promise he would say and i must keep it
that people gave him the name of el amin which means the truthful at this time he was only sixteen years of age but the rich traders had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business to attend to and trusted him with large sums of money
and sold there the goods carried by the camels
and faithfully paid over to the owners of the goods the money he had received mohammed had no school education he could neither read nor write but he was not ignorant he knew well how to do the work intrusted to him and
this woman was a widow who was carrying on the business left her by her husband as soon as the camel driver saw mohammed he stopped him and said my mistress wishes to see you before noon i think she intends to engage you to take charge of her caravans
as quickly as possible he went to the house of khadijah for he was well pleased at the thought of being employed in so important a service
she said i have heard much of you among the traders
are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole time and service to me mohammed was delighted
khadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business and he served her well and faithfully she thought a great deal of him
and soon they came to love one another and were married as he was now the husband of a rich woman he did not need to work very hard he still continued to attend to his wifes business but he did not make so many journeys as before
and christianity but he was not satisfied with either of them
worshiped idols very few of them were christians
in a cave on mount hira near mecca he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious meditation he declared that while praying in his cave he often had visions of god and heaven
he said that many times the angel gabriel appeared to him and revealed to him the religion which he afterwards taught his followers as he himself could not write he committed to memory all that the angel told him and had it written in a book
this book is called the koran which means like our own word bible the book
three when mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to him he told his wife of what he had seen and heard she at once believed and so became a convert to the new religion
she fell upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out there is but one god mohammed is gods prophet mohammed then told the story to other members of his family some of them believed and became his first followers
soon afterwards he began to preach to the people he spoke in the market and other public places
laughed at what he told them but some poor people and a few slaves believed him and adopted the new religion others said he was a dreamer and a fool mohammed however paid no heed to the insults he received
he went on telling about the appearance of gabriel and preaching the doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the people
at such times his face grew pale as death his eyes became red and staring he spoke in a loud voice and his body trembled violently then he would tell what he had seen in his vision
people came from distant parts of arabia and from neighboring countries to hear him one day six of the chief men of me dina
about this time mohammeds uncle and wife died and he had then hardly any friends in mecca he therefore resolved to leave that city and go to medina numbers of the people there believed his doctrines
and wished him to come and live among them so he secretly left his native town and fled from his enemies with a few faithful companions he made his escape to medina
that mohammed fled from mecca this event is very important in mohammedan history it is called the flight of the prophet or the heji ra
the remainder of his life a splendid church was built for him in medina it was called a mosque and all mohammedan churches or places of worship
he gained many victories he marched against mecca with an army of ten thousand men and the city surrendered with little resistance the people then joined his religion and destroyed their idols
he was buried in the mosque in which he had held religious services for so many years
that the body still lies in the coffin in the same state as when it was first buried
that the coffin of mohammed rests somewhere between heaven and earth suspended in the air but this fable was invented by enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion
every mussulman is bound by his religion to make a visit or pilgrimage to mecca at least once in his life
of the mosque and chanting in a loud voice such words as these come to prayer come to prayer there is no god but god he giveth life and he dieth not i praise his perfection god is great in mecca
there is a mosque called the great mosque it is a large enclosure in the form of a quadrangle or square
it its wall at one corner is the celebrated black stone moslems regard this stone with the greatest reverence they say that it came down from heaven it is said to have been once white
but has become dark from being wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims it really is reddish brown in color before the time of mohammed the kaa ba was a pagan temple
but when he took possession of mecca he made the old temple the centre of worship for his own religion after mohammed died a person was appointed to be his successor as head of the moslem church
and this title has been borne ever since by the religious chief of the mohammedans in modern times the sultans or rulers of turkey
right off i observed a cluster of mountains about two thousand feet high whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted after our position fix i reentered the lounge and when our bearings were reported on the chart i saw that we were off the island of ceylon
that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the indian peninsula i went looking in the library for a book about this island one of the most fertile in the world sure enough i found a volume entitled ceylon and the singhalese
reentering the lounge i first noted the bearings of ceylon on which antiquity lavished so many different names
its length is two hundred seventy five miles its maximum width one hundred fifty miles its circumference nine hundred miles its surface area twenty four thousand four hundred forty eight square miles
in other words a little smaller than that of ireland just then captain nemo and his chief officer appeared the captain glanced at the chart then turning to me the island of ceylon he said
is famous for its pearl fisheries would you be interested professor aronnax
certainly captain fine its easily done only when we see the fisheries well see no fishermen
and well arrive there late tonight
who went out immediately soon the nautilus reentered its liquid element and the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty feet with the chart under my eyes
i found it by the ninth parallel off the northwestern shores of ceylon
to reach it we had to go all the way up ceylons west coast professor captain nemo then told me there are pearl fisheries in the bay of bengal the seas of the east indies
the seas of china and japan plus those seas south of the united states the gulf of panama and the gulf of california but its off ceylon that such fishing reaps its richest rewards no doubt well be arriving a little early
only during the month of march and for thirty days some three hundred boats concentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea each boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen the latter divide into two groups
dive in rotation and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to their boat you mean i said
that such primitive methods are still all that they use all
although these fisheries belong to the most industrialized people in the world the english
yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman service in such work yes since those poor fishermen cant stay long underwater on his voyage to ceylon
the englishman percival made much of a kaffir who stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface but i find that hard to believe
i know that some divers can last up to fifty seven seconds and highly skillful ones to eighty seven but such men are rare
i believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate is thirty seconds during which they hastily stuff their little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose
their vision weakens ulcers break out on their eyes sores form on their bodies and some are even stricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor yes i said its a sad occupation
and one that exists only to gratify the whims of fashion but tell me captain how many oysters can a boat fish up in a workday
its even said that in eighteen fourteen when the english government went fishing on its own behalf its divers worked just twenty days and brought up seventy six million oysters
the fishermen are well paid arent they hardly professor in panama they make just one dollar per week in most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl and they bring up so many that have none
only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich thats atrocious on that note professor captain nemo told me
and if by chance some eager fisherman arrives early well we can watch him at work that suits me captain by the way professor aronnax you arent afraid of sharks are you sharks i exclaimed
this struck me as a pretty needless question to say the least well captain nemo went on i admit captain im not yet on very familiar terms with that genus of fish were used to them
the rest of us captain nemo answered and in time you will be too anyhow well be armed and on our way we might hunt a man eater or two its a fascinating sport so professor ill see you tomorrow
bright and early this said in a carefree tone captain nemo left the lounge if youre invited to hunt bears in the swiss mountains you might say oh good i get to go bear hunting tomorrow
if youre invited to hunt lions on the atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of india you might say ha nows my chance to hunt lions and tigers but if youre invited to hunt sharks in their native element
you might want to think it over before accepting as for me i passed a hand over my brow where beads of cold sweat were busy forming lets think this over i said to myself and lets take our time
hunting otters in underwater forests as we did in the forests of crespo island is an acceptable activity
thats another story i know that in certain countries particularly the andaman islands negroes dont hesitate to attack sharks dagger in one hand and noose in the other
but i also know that many who face those fearsome animals dont come back alive besides im not a negro and even if i were a negro in this instance i dont think a little hesitation on my part would be out of place
and there i was fantasizing about sharks envisioning huge jaws armed with multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half i could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle
and how i resented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his deplorable invitation
thank heavens i said to myself conseil will never want to come along and thatll be my excuse for not going with the captain as for ned land i admit i felt less confident of his wisdom
danger however great held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature i went back to reading sirrs book but i leafed through it mechanically between the lines i kept seeing fearsome wide open jaws
just then conseil and the canadian entered with a calm even gleeful air little did they know what was waiting for them ye gods sir ned land told me your captain nemo the devil take him
has just made us a very pleasant proposition oh i said you know about with all due respect to master conseil replied the nautiluss commander has invited us together with master
for a visit tomorrow to ceylons magnificent pearl fisheries he did so in the most cordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman he didnt tell you anything else nothing sir the canadian replied
he said youd already discussed this little stroll indeed i said but didnt he give you any details on not a one mister naturalist you will be going with us right me
why yes certainly of course i can see that you like the idea mister land yes it will be a really unusual experience and possibly dangerous i added in an insinuating tone
dangerous ned land replied a simple trip to an oysterbank assuredly
for my part i stared at them with anxious eyes as if they were already missing a limb or two should i alert them yes surely but i hardly knew how to go about it would master
conseil said to me give us some background on pearl fishing on the fishing itself i asked or on the occupational hazards that on the fishing the canadian replied before we tackle the terrain it helps to be familiar with it
all right sit down my friends
ned and conseil took seats on a couch and right off the canadian said to me sir just what is a pearl exactly my gallant ned i replied for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea
for orientals its a drop of solidified dew for the ladies its a jewel
necks and ears thats oblong in shape glassy in luster and formed from mother of pearl for chemists its a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate with a little gelatin protein
and finally for naturalists its a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces mother of pearl in certain bivalves branch mollusca conseil said class
acephala order testacea correct my scholarly conseil now then those testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone
turbo snails giant clams and saltwater scallops briefly all those that secrete mother of pearl in other words that blue azure violet or white substance
lining the insides of their valves are mussels included too the canadian asked yes the mussels of certain streams in scotland wales ireland saxony bohemia and france
good the canadian replied from now on well pay closer attention to em but i went on for secreting pearls the ideal mollusk is the pearl oyster meleagrina margaritifera
that valuable shellfish pearls result simply from mother of pearl solidifying into a globular shape either they stick to the oysters shell or they become embedded in the creatures folds
on the valves a pearl sticks fast on the flesh it lies loose but its nucleus is always some small hard object say a sterile egg or a grain of sand
around which the mother of pearl is deposited in thin concentric layers over several years in succession can one find several pearls in the same oyster conseil asked yes my boy
they even mention one oyster about which i remain dubious
ned land yelped did i say sharks i exclaimed hastily i meant one hundred fifty pearls sharks wouldnt make sense indeed conseil said
but will master now tell us how one goes about extracting these pearls one proceeds in several ways and often when pearls stick to the valves fishermen even pull them loose with pliers
thus they die in the open air and by the end of ten days theyve rotted sufficiently next theyre immersed in huge tanks of salt water then theyre opened up and washed at this point the sorters begin their twofold task
first they remove the layers of mother of pearl which are known in the industry by the names legitimate silver bastard white or bastard black
then they remove the oysters meaty tissue boil it and finally strain it in order to extract even the smallest pearls do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size conseil asked not only on their size i replied
but also according to their shape their water in other words their color and their orient in other words that dappled shimmering glow that makes them so delightful to the eye the finest pearls are called virgin pearls or paragons
they form in isolation within the mollusks tissue theyre white often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency and usually spherical or pear shaped the spherical ones are made into bracelets
the pear shaped ones into earrings and since theyre the most valuable theyre priced individually the other pearls that stick to the oysters shell are more erratically shaped and are priced by weight finally classed in the lowest order
the smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls theyre priced by the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church vestments but it must be a long hard job sorting out these pearls by size
the canadian said no my friend that task is performed with eleven strainers or sieves that are pierced with different numbers of holes those pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first order
those not slipping through the sieves pierced with one hundred to eight hundred holes are in the second order finally those pearls for which one uses strainers pierced with nine hundred to one thousand holes make up the seed pearls
how ingenious conseil said to reduce dividing and classifying pearls to a mechanical operation and could master tell us the profits brought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters according to sirrs book i replied
these ceylon fisheries are farmed annually for a total profit of three million man eaters francs conseil rebuked yes francs three million francs i went on
but i dont think these fisheries bring in the returns they once did similarly the central american fisheries
but now they bring in only two thirds of that amount all in all its estimated that nine million francs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl harvesting industry but conseil asked
havent certain famous pearls been quoted at extremely high prices yes my boy
ive even heard stories the canadian said about some lady in ancient times who drank pearls in vinegar cleopatra conseil shot back it must have tasted pretty bad ned land added abominable ned my friend
conseil replied but when a little glass of vinegar is worth one million five hundred thousand francs its taste is a small price to pay
ned land married to cleopatra conseil exclaimed but i was all set to tie the knot conseil the canadian replied in all seriousness
i even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancee kate tender but she married somebody else instead
but you can absolutely trust me on this professor its pearls were so big
my gallant ned i replied laughing those were artificial pearls ordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with essence of orient wow
that essence of orient must sell for quite a large sum as little as zero it comes from the scales of a european carp its nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is preserved in ammonia its worthless
maybe thats why kate tender married somebody else replied mister land philosophically but i said getting back to pearls of great value i dont think any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by captain nemo
this one conseil said pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass case exactly and im certainly not far off when i estimate its value at two million uh francs
conseil said quickly yes i said two million francs and no doubt all it cost our captain was the effort to pick it up ha ned land exclaimed during our stroll tomorrow who says we wont run into one just like it
conseil put in and why not what good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the nautilus here no ned land said but elsewhere oh elsewhere conseil put in
shaking his head in fact i said mister land is right and if we ever brought back to europe or america a pearl worth millions it would make the story of our adventures more authentic and much more rewarding thats how i see it
the canadian said but said conseil who perpetually returned to the didactic side of things is this pearl fishing ever dangerous no i replied quickly especially if one takes certain precautions
what risks would you run in a job like that ned land said swallowing a few gulps of salt water whatever you say ned then trying to imitate captain nemos carefree tone i asked
by the way gallant ned are you afraid of sharks
the canadian replied im a professional harpooner its my job to make a mockery of them it isnt an issue i said of fishing for them with a swivel hook hoisting them onto the deck of a ship
opening the belly ripping out the heart and tossing it into the sea so its an issue of yes precisely in the water in the water ye gods just give me a good harpoon
you see sir these sharks are badly designed they have to roll their bellies over to snap you up and in the meantime ned land had a way of pronouncing the word snap
well how about you conseil what are your feelings about these man eaters me conseil said im afraid i must be frank with master good for you i thought
if you have lived in cities and have walked in the park on a summer afternoon you have perhaps seen blinking in a corner of his iron cage
a huge grotesque kind of monkey a creature with ugly sagging hairless skin below his eyes and a bright purple underbody this monkey is a true monster
in the completeness of his ugliness he achieved a kind of perverted beauty children stopping before the cage are fascinated men turn away with an air of disgust and women linger for a moment
trying perhaps to remember which one of their male acquaintances the thing in some faint way resembles had you been in the earlier years of your life a citizen of the village of winesburg ohio
there would have been for you no mystery in regard to the beast in his cage it is like wash williams you would have said as he sits in the corner there the beast is exactly like old wash
sitting on the grass in the station yard on a summer evening after he has closed his office for the night wash williams the telegraph operator of winesburg was the ugliest thing in town his girth was immense
his neck thin his legs feeble he was dirty everything about him was unclean even the whites of his eyes looked soiled i go too fast not everything about wash was unclean
he took care of his hands his fingers were fat but there was something sensitive and shapely in the hand that lay on the table by the instrument in the telegraph office in his youth
wash williams had been called the best telegraph operator in the state and in spite of his degradement to the obscure office at winesburg he was still proud of his ability
wash williams did not associate with the men of the town in which he lived ill have nothing to do with them he said looking with bleary eyes at the men who walked along the station platform
past the telegraph office up along main street he went in the evening to ed griffiths saloon and after drinking unbelievable quantities of beer staggered off to his room in the new willard house and to his bed for the night
wash williams was a man of courage a thing had happened to him that made him hate life and he hated it wholeheartedly with the abandon of a poet first of all he hated women
bitches he called them his feeling toward men was somewhat different he pitied them does not every man let his life be managed for him by some bitch or another he asked
in winesburg no attention was paid to wash williams and his hatred of his fellows once missus white the bankers wife complained to the telegraph company
and smelled abominably but nothing came of her complaint here and there a man respected the operator instinctively the man felt in him a glowing resentment of something he had not the courage to resent
when wash walked through the streets such a one had an instinct to pay him homage to raise his hat or to bow before him the superintendent who had supervision over the telegraph operators
on the railroad that went through winesburg felt that way he had put wash into the obscure office at winesburg to avoid discharging him and he meant to keep him there when he received the letter of complaint from the bankers wife
he tore it up and laughed unpleasantly for some reason he thought of his own wife as he tore up the letter wash williams once had a wife when he was still a young man he married a woman at dayton ohio
the woman was tall and slender and had blue eyes and yellow hair wash was himself a comely youth he loved the woman with a love as absorbing as the hatred he later felt for all women
in all of winesburg there was but one person who knew the story of the thing that had made ugly the person and the character of wash williams
he once told the story to george willard and the telling of the tale came about in this way george willard went one evening to walk with belle carpenter a trimmer of womens hats
who worked in a millinery shop kept by missus kate mc hugh the young man was not in love with the woman
in ed griffiths saloon but as they walked about under the trees they occasionally embraced the night and their own thoughts had aroused something in them as they were returning to main street they passed the little lawn
beside the railroad station and saw wash williams apparently asleep on the grass beneath a tree on the next evening the operator and george willard walked out together down the railroad they went
and sat on a pile of decaying railroad ties beside the tracks it was then that the operator told the young reporter his story of hate perhaps a dozen times
george willard and the strange shapeless man who lived at his fathers hotel had been on the point of talking the young man looked at the hideous leering face
something he saw lurking in the staring eyes told him that the man who had nothing to say to others had nevertheless something to say to him
he waited expectantly when the operator remained silent and seemed to have changed his mind about talking he tried to make conversation were you ever married mister williams he began
i suppose you were and your wife is dead is that it wash williams spat forth a succession of vile oaths yes she is dead he agreed she is dead as all women are dead
she is a living dead thing walking in the sight of men and making the earth foul by her presence staring into the boys eyes the man became purple with rage dont have fool notions in your head
he commanded my wife she is dead yes surely i tell you all women are dead my mother your mother
and with whom i saw you walking about yesterday all of them they are all dead i tell you there is something rotten about them i was married sure my wife was dead before she married me
she was a foul thing come out a woman more foul she was a thing sent to make life unbearable to me i was a fool do you see as you are now and so i married this woman
i would like to see men a little begin to understand women they are sent to prevent men making the world worth while it is a trick in nature ugh they are creeping crawling squirming things
they with their soft hands and their blue eyes the sight of a woman sickens me why i dont kill every woman i see i dont know
half frightened and yet fascinated by the light burning in the eyes of the hideous old man george willard listened afire with curiosity darkness came on and he leaned forward
when in the gathering darkness he could no longer see the purple bloated face and the burning eyes a curious fancy came to him wash williams talked in low even tones
that made his words seem the more terrible in the darkness the young reporter found himself imagining that he sat on the railroad ties beside a comely young man with black hair and black shining eyes
there was something almost beautiful in the voice of wash williams the hideous telling his story of hate the telegraph operator of winesburg sitting in the darkness on the railroad ties had become a poet
hatred had raised him to that elevation it is because i saw you kissing the lips of that belle carpenter that i tell you my story he said what happened to me may next happen to you
already you may be having dreams in your head
wash williams began telling the story of his married life with the tall blonde girl with the blue eyes whom he had met when he was a young operator at dayton ohio here and there his story was touched with moments of beauty
intermingled with strings of vile curses the operator had married the daughter of a dentist who was the youngest of three sisters on his marriage day because of his ability he was promoted to a position as dispatcher
at an increased salary and sent to an office at columbus ohio there he settled down with his young wife and began buying a house on the installment plan the young telegraph operator was madly in love
with a kind of religious fervor he had managed to go through the pitfalls of his youth and to remain virginal until after his marriage he made for george willard a picture of his life in the house at columbus ohio with the young wife
in the garden back of our house we planted vegetables he said you know peas and corn and such things we went to columbus in early march and as soon as the days became warm i went to work in the garden
with a spade i turned up the black ground while she ran about
late in april came the planting in the little paths among the seed beds she stood holding a paper bag in her hand the bag was filled with seeds a few at a time she handed me the seeds
for a moment there was a catch in the voice of the man talking in the darkness i loved her he said i dont claim not to be a fool i love her yet there in the dusk in the spring evening
i kissed her shoes and the ankles above her shoes when the hem of her garment touched my face i trembled when after two years of that life
or her i just sent her home to her mother and said nothing there was nothing to say i had four hundred dollars in the bank and i gave her that i didnt ask her reasons
i didnt say anything when she had gone i cried like a silly boy pretty soon i had a chance to sell the house and i sent that money to her wash williams and george willard
arose from the pile of railroad ties and walked along the tracks toward town the operator finished his tale quickly breathlessly her mother sent for me he said
she wrote me a letter and asked me to come to their house at dayton when i got there it was evening about this time wash williams voice rose to a half scream
i sat in the parlor of that house two hours her mother took me in there and left me their house was stylish they were what is called respectable people there were plush chairs and a couch in the room
i was trembling all over i hated the men i thought had wronged her i was sick of living alone and wanted her back the longer i waited the more raw and tender i became i thought that if she came in and just
touched me with her hand i would perhaps faint away i ached to forgive and forget wash williams stopped and stood staring at george willard
again the mans voice became soft and low she came into the room naked he went on her mother did that while i sat there she was taking the girls clothes off perhaps coaxing her to do it
first i heard voices at the door that led into a little hallway
the girl was ashamed and stood perfectly still staring at the floor the mother didnt come into the room when she had pushed the girl in through the door she stood in the hallway waiting hoping we would well
you see waiting george willard and the telegraph operator came into the main street of winesburg the lights from the store windows lay bright and shining on the sidewalks people moved about laughing and talking
the young reporter felt ill and weak in imagination he also became old and shapeless i didnt get the mother killed said wash williams staring up and down the street i struck her once with a chair
and then the neighbors came in and took it away
the peace of righteousness
there can be no nobler cause for which to work than the peace of righteousness and high honor is due those serene and lofty souls who with wisdom and courage
with high idealism tempered by sane facing of the actual facts of life have striven to bring nearer the day when armed strife between nation and nation between class and class
between man and man shall end throughout the world because all this is true it is also true that there are no men more ignoble or more foolish no men whose actions are fraught with greater possibility of mischief
to their country and to mankind than those who exalt unrighteous peace as better than righteous war the men who have stood highest in our history as in the history of all countries are those who scorned injustice
who were incapable of oppressing the weak or of permitting their country with their consent to oppress the weak but who did not hesitate to draw the sword when to leave it undrawn meant inability to arrest triumphant wrong
yet every man in active affairs who also reads about the past grows by bitter experience to realize that there are plenty of men not only among those who mean ill but among those who mean well
who are ready enough to praise what was done in the past and yet are incapable of profiting by it when faced by the needs of the present during our generation this seems to have been peculiarly the case among the men
who have become obsessed with the idea of obtaining universal peace by some cheap patent panacea there has been a real and substantial growth
in the feeling for international responsibility and justice among the great civilized nations during the past threescore or fourscore years there has been a real growth of recognition of the fact
and that in most cases war is an evil method of settling international difficulties but as yet there has been only a rudimentary beginning of the development of international tribunals of justice
and there has been no development at all of any international police power now as i have already said the whole fabric of municipal law of law within each nation
rests ultimately upon the judge and the policeman and the complete absence of the policeman and the almost complete absence of the judge in international affairs prevents there being as yet any real homology
between municipal and international law moreover the questions which sometimes involve nations in war are far more difficult and complex than any questions that affect merely individuals
almost every great nation has inherited certain questions either with other nations or with sections of its own people which it is quite impossible in the present state of civilization to decide
as matters between private individuals can be decided during the last century at least half of the wars that have been fought have been civil and not foreign wars there are big and powerful nations which habitually commit either upon other nations
or upon sections of their own people wrongs so outrageous as to justify even the most peaceful persons in going to war there are also weak nations so utterly incompetent
either to protect the rights of foreigners against their own citizens or to protect their own citizens against foreigners that it becomes a matter of sheer duty for some outside power to interfere in connection with them
as yet in neither case is there any efficient method of getting international action and if joint action by several powers is secured the result is usually considerably worse than if only one power interfered
the worst infamies of modern times such affairs as the massacres of the armenians by the turks for instance have been perpetrated in a time of nominally profound international peace
when there has been a concert of big powers to prevent the breaking of this peace although only by breaking it could the outrages be stopped be it remembered that the peoples who suffered by these hideous massacres who saw their women violated
otherwise they would not have been massacred for if the jews in russia and the armenians in turkey had been armed and had been efficient in the use of their arms no mob would have meddled with them
yet amiable but fatuous persons with all these facts before their eyes pass resolutions demanding universal arbitration for everything
and their abandonment of their armed forces or else they write well meaning solemn little books or pamphlets or editorials and articles in magazines or newspapers to show
because it is expensive this is precisely like arguing that we should disband the police and devote our sole attention to persuading criminals
suppose that burglary highway robbery and white slavery are profitable it is almost useless to attempt to argue with these well intentioned persons because they are suffering under an obsession and are not open to reason
they go wrong at the outset for they lay all the emphasis on peace and none at all on righteousness they are not all of them physically timid men but they are usually men
from insulting or wronging the people of other nations but they always ardently advocate that we in our turn shall tamely submit to wrong and insult from other nations
as americans their folly is peculiarly scandalous because if the principles they now uphold are right it means that it would have been better that americans should never have achieved their independence and better that
in eighteen sixty one they should have peacefully submitted to seeing their country split into half a dozen jangling confederacies and slavery made perpetual if unwilling to learn from their own history
look at the difference between china and japan china has neither a fleet nor an efficient army it is a huge civilized empire one of the most populous on the globe and it has been the helpless prey
of outsiders because it does not possess the power to fight japan stands on a footing of equality with european and american nations because it does possess this power china now sees japan
russia germany england and france in possession of fragments of her empire and has twice within the lifetime of the present generation seen her capital in the hands of allied invaders because she in very fact
realizes the ideals of the persons who wish the united states to disarm and then trust that our helplessness will secure us a contemptuous immunity from attack by outside nations
the chief trouble comes from the entire inability of these worthy people to understand that they are demanding things that are mutually incompatible when they demand peace at any price and also justice and righteousness
i remember one representative of their number who used to write little sonnets on behalf of the mahdi and the sudanese these sonnets setting forth the need that the sudan should be both independent and peaceful
as a matter of fact the sudan valued independence only because it desired to war against all christians and to carry on an unlimited slave trade
under the mahdi for a dozen years and during those dozen years the bigotry tyranny and cruel religious intolerance were such as flourished in the seventh century and in spite of systematic slave raids
the population decreased by nearly two thirds and practically all the children died peace came well being came freedom from rape and murder and torture and highway robbery and every brutal gratification of lust and greed came
only when the sudan lost its independence and passed under english rule yet this well meaning little sonneteer sincerely felt that his verses were issued in the cause of humanity
looking back from the vantage point of a score of years probably every one will agree that he was an absurd person but he was not one whit more absurd than most of the more prominent persons who advocate disarmament by the united states
the cessation of up building the navy and the promise to agree to arbitrate all matters including those affecting our national interests and honor with all foreign nations these persons would do no harm
if they affected only themselves many of them are in the ordinary relations of life good citizens they are exactly like the other good citizens who believe that enforced universal vegetarianism or anti vaccination
is the panacea for all ills but in their particular case they are able to do harm because they affect our relations with foreign powers so that other men pay the debt which they themselves have really incurred
it is the foolish peace at any price persons who try to persuade our people to make unwise and improper treaties or to stop building up the navy but if trouble comes and the treaties are repudiated
it is not these people who will pay anything they will stay at home in safety and leave brave men to pay in blood and honest men to pay in shame for their folly the trouble is that our policy is apt to go in zigzags
because different sections of our people exercise at different times unequal pressure on our government one class of our citizens clamors for treaties impossible of fulfilment and improper to fulfil
so far i have been dealing with our general outfit and shall now pass to the special equipment of the shore party the hut we took out was built on my property on bundefjord so that i was able to watch the work as it progressed
it was built by the brothers hans and joergen stubberud and was throughout a splendid piece of work which did honour to both the brothers the materials proved excellent in every way the hut was twenty six feet long by thirteen feet wide
its height from the floor to the ridge of the roof was about twelve feet it was built as an ordinary norwegian house with pointed gable and had two rooms one of these was nineteen and a half feet long and was to serve as our dormitory dining room and sitting room
the other room was six and a half feet long and was to be lindstroems kitchen from the kitchen a double trap door led to the loft where we intended to keep a quantity of provisions and outfit the walls consisted of three inch planks
for insulation we used cellulose pulp the floor and the ceiling between the rooms and the loft were double
the doors were extraordinarily thick and strong and fitted into oblique grooves so that they closed very tightly there were two windows a triple one in the end wall of the main room and a double one in the kitchen
for the covering of the roof we took out roofing paper and for the floor linoleum in the main room there were two air pipes
there were bunks for ten men in two stages six on one wall and four on the other the furniture of the room consisted of a table a stool for each man and a lux lamp
the hut was tarred several times and every part was carefully marked so that it could easily be set up to fasten it to the ground and prevent the antarctic storms from blowing it away i had strong eyebolts screwed into each end of the roof ridge
and the four corners of the roof we carried six strong eyebolts a metre long to be rammed into the barrier between these bolts and those on the hut steel wires were to be stretched which could be drawn quite tight we also had two spare cables
which could be stretched over the roof if the gales were too severe the two ventilating pipes and the chimney were secured outside with strong stays as will be seen every precaution was taken to make the hut warm and comfortable
and to hold it down on the ground we also took on board a quantity of loose timber boards and planks besides the hut we took with us fifteen tents for sixteen men each ten of these were old but good
they were served out to us from the naval stores the other five were new and we bought them from the army depots it was our intention to use the tents as temporary houses they were easily and quickly set up and were strong and warm
on the voyage to the south roenne sewed new floors of good strong canvas to the five new tents all cases of provisions that were intended for winter quarters were marked and stowed separately in the hold
we had ten sledges made by a firm of sporting outfitters in christiania they were built like the old nansen sledges but rather broader and were twelve feet long the runners were of the best american hickory shod with steel
the other parts were of good tough norwegian ash to each sledge belonged a pair of spare runners which could easily be fitted underneath by means of clamps and as easily removed when not required
the steel shoeing of the runners was well coated with red lead and the spare runners with tar these sledges were extremely strongly built and could stand all kinds of work on every sort of surface at that time
i did not know the conditions on the barrier as i afterwards came to know them of course these sledges were very heavy we took twenty pairs of ski all of the finest hickory they were eight feet long and proportionately narrow
i chose them of this length with a view to being able to cross the numerous cracks in the glaciers the greater the surface over which the weight could be distributed the better prospect we should have of slipping over the snow bridges
we had forty ski poles with ebonite points the ski bindings were a combination of the huitfeldt and the hoeyer ellefsen bindings we also had quantities of loose straps
we had six three man tents all made in the navy workshops the workmanship could not have been better they were the strongest and most practical tents that have ever been used they were made of the closest canvas with the floor in one piece
one man was sufficient to set up the tent in the stiffest breeze i have come to the conclusion that the fewer poles a tent has the easier it is to set up which seems quite natural these tents have only one pole
how often one reads in narratives of polar travel that it took such and such a time often hours to set up the tent and then when at last it was up one lay expecting it to be blown down at any moment
there was no question of this with our tents they were up in a twinkling and stood against all kinds of wind we could lie securely in our sleeping bags and let it blow the arrangement of the door was on the usual sack principle
which came from the estate of palsgaard in jutland and the material did all it promised these cases were one foot square and fifteen and a half inches high
they had only a little round opening on the top closed with an aluminium lid which fitted exactly like the lid of a milk can large lids weaken the cases and i had therefore chosen this form we did not have to throw off the lashing of the case to get the lid off
and this is a very great advantage we could always get at it a case with a large lid covered by the lashing gives constant trouble the whole lashing has to be undone for every little thing one wants out of the case this is not always convenient
if one is tired and slack it may sometimes happen that one will put off till to morrow what ought to be done to day especially when it is bitterly cold
the handier ones sledging outfit the sooner one gets into the tent and to rest and that is no small consideration on a long journey our outfit of clothing was abundant and more complete i suppose than that of any former polar expedition
we may divide it into two classes the outfit for specially low temperatures and that for more moderate temperatures it must be remembered that no one had yet wintered on the barrier so we had to be prepared for anything
in order to be able to grapple with any degree of cold we were supplied with the richest assortment of reindeer skin clothing we had it specially thick medium and quite light it took a long time to get these skin clothes prepared
first the reindeer skins had to be bought in a raw state
let me take the opportunity of thanking this man for the many and great services he has rendered me not only during my preparations for the third voyage of the fram
with his help i have succeeded in obtaining things that i should otherwise never have been able to get he shrank from no amount of work but went on till he had found what i wanted
this time he procured nearly two hundred and fifty good reindeer skins dressed by the lapps and sent them to christiania here i had great trouble in finding a man who could sew skins but at last i found one
we then went to work to make clothes after the pattern of the netchelli eskimo and the sewing went on early and late thick anoraks and thin ones heavy breeches and light winter stockings and summer stockings
we also had a dozen thin sleeping bags which i thought of using inside the big thick ones if the cold should be too severe everything was finished but not until the last moment the outer sleeping bags were made by mister brandt furrier of bergen
and they were so excellent both in material and making up that no one in the world could have done better it was a model piece of work to save this outer sleeping bag we had it provided with a cover of the lightest canvas
which was a good deal longer than the bag itself it was easy to tie the end of the cover together like the mouth of the sack and this kept the snow out of the bag during the days march
in this way we always kept ourselves free from the annoyance of drifting snow we attached great importance to having the bags made of the very best sort of skin and took care that the thin skin of the belly was removed
as of course the cold penetrates more easily through the thin skin and gives rise to dampness in the form of rime on meeting the warmth of the body these thin patches remain damp whenever one is in the bag and in a short time they lose their hair
the damp spreads like decay in wood and continually attacks the surrounding skin with the result that one fine day you find yourself with a hairless sleeping bag
our burberry wind clothes were made in the form of anorak blouse and trousers both very roomy the others consisted of trousers and jacket with hood our mits were for the most part such as one can buy in any shop
we wanted nothing else in and around winter quarters outside the mits we wore an outer covering of windproof material so as not to wear them out too quickly these mits are not very strong though they are good and warm
besides these we had ten pairs of ordinary kid mits which were bought at a glove shop in christiania and were practically impossible to wear out i wore mine from framheim to the pole and back again and afterwards on the voyage to tasmania
the lining of course was torn in places but the seams of the mits were just as perfect as the day i bought them taking into consideration the fact that i went on ski the whole way and used two poles it will be understood that the mits were strongly made
we also had a number of woollen gloves which curiously enough the others greatly prized for myself i was never able to wear such things they simply freeze the fingers off me but most important of all is the covering of the feet
for the feet are the most exposed members and the most difficult to protect one can look after the hands
and this is a sufficiently troublesome piece of work to make one disinclined to undo it again until one is turning in they cannot be seen in the course of the day and one has to depend entirely on feeling but feeling in this case often plays curious tricks
for if they had known it they could not possibly have let it go so far the fact is that in this case sensation is a somewhat doubtful guide for the feet lose all sensation
it is true that there is a transitional stage when one feels the cold smarting in ones toes and tries to get rid of it by stamping the feet as a rule this is successful the warmth returns or the circulation is restored
but it occasionally happens that sensation is lost at the very moment when these precautions are taken and then one must be an old hand to know what has happened many men conclude that as they no longer feel the unpleasant smarting sensation all is well
and at the evening inspection a frozen foot of tallow like appearance presents itself an event of this kind may ruin the most elaborately prepared enterprise and it is therefore advisable in the matter of feet
to carry ones caution to lengths which may seem ridiculous now it is a fact that if one can wear soft foot gear exclusively the risk of frost bite is far less than if one is compelled to wear stiff boots in soft foot gear of course
the foot can move far more easily and keep warm but we were to take ski and to get full use out of them so that in any case we had to have a stiff sole for the sake of the bindings it is of no use to have a good binding unless you can use it in the right way
in my opinion on a long journey such as that we had before us the ski must be perfectly steady i do not know anything that tires me more than a bad fastening that is one that allows the foot to shift in the binding
i want the ski to be a part of oneself so that one always has full command of them i have tried many patents for i have always been afraid of a stiff fastening in cold temperatures but all these patents without exception are worthless in the long run
i decided this time to try a combination of stiff and soft foot gear so that we could use the splendid huitfeldt hoeyer ellefsen bindings but this was no easy matter of our whole outfit nothing caused me more worry
or gave us all more work in the course of the expedition than the stiff outer covering which we had to have but we solved the problem at last i applied to one of the leading makers of ski boots in christiania and explained the difficulty to him
fortunately i had found a man who was evidently interested in the question we agreed that he should make a sample pair after the pattern of ski boots the sole was to be thick and stiff for we had to be prepared to use crampons but the uppers as soft as possible
in order to avoid leather which usually becomes stiff and easily cracked in the cold he was to use a combination of leather and thin canvas for the uppers leather nearest the sole and canvas above it the measurements were taken from my foot
which is not exactly a childs foot with two pairs of reindeer skin stockings on and ten pairs were made
they were exhibited in the bootmakers windows i used to go a long way round to avoid coming face to face with these monsters in public we are all a trifle vain and dislike having our own shortcomings shown up in electric light
if i had ever cherished any illusions on the subject of a dainty little foot i am sure the last trace of such vanity died out on the day i passed the shoemakers window and beheld my own boots
i never went that way again until i was certain that the exhibition was closed one thing is certain that the boots were a fine piece of workmanship we shall hear later on of the alterations they had to undergo before we at last made them as large as we wanted
for the giant boots turned out much too small among other equipment i must mention our excellent primus cooking apparatus this all came complete from a firm in stockholm for cooking on sledge journeys the primus stove ranks above all others
it gives a great deal of heat uses little oil and requires no attention advantages which are important enough anywhere but especially when sledging there is never any trouble with this apparatus it has come as near perfection as possible
we took five nansen cookers with us this cooker utilizes the heat more completely than any other but i have one objection to make to it it takes up space we used it on our depot journeys
but were unfortunately obliged to give it up on the main southern journey we were so many in a tent and space was so limited that i dared not risk using it if one has room enough it is ideal in my opinion
we had with us ten pairs of snow shoes and one hundred sets of dog harness of the alaska eskimo pattern the alaska eskimo drive their dogs in tandem the whole pull is thus straight ahead in the direction the sledge is going
and this is undoubtedly the best way of utilizing the power i had made up my mind to adopt the same system in sledging on the barrier another great advantage it had was that the dogs would pass singly across fissures
so that the danger of falling through was considerably reduced the exertion of pulling is also less trying with alaska harness than with the greenland kind as the alaska harness has a shallow padded collar
which is slipped over the animals head and makes the weight of the pull come on his shoulders whereas the greenland harness presses on his chest raw places which occur rather frequently with the greenland harness are almost entirely avoided with the other
all the sets of harness were made in the navy workshops and after their long and hard use they are as good as ever there could be no better recommendation than this of instruments and apparatus for the sledge journeys we carried two sextants
three artificial horizons of which two were glass horizons with dark glasses and one a mercury horizon and four spirit compasses made in christiania they were excellent little compasses
i had drawn the makers attention to this beforehand and asked him to use as pure a spirit as possible what his object was i still do not know but the spirit he employed was highly dilute
the best proof of this was that the liquid in our compasses froze before the spirits in a flask we were naturally inconvenienced by this besides these we had an ordinary little pocket compass two pairs of binoculars one by zeiss and the other by goertz
and snow goggles from doctor schanz
during the whole stay on the barrier i myself wore a pair of ordinary spectacles with yellow glasses of quite a light tint
how excellent these glasses are appears clearly enough from the fact that i never had the slightest touch of snow blindness on the southern journey
it will perhaps be suggested that i am less susceptible to this ailment than others but i know from personal experience that such is not the case i have previously had several severe attacks of snow blindness we had two photographic cameras an air thermometer
two aneroids with altitude scale to fifteen thousand feet and two hypsometers the hypsometer is only an instrument for determining the boiling point which gives one the height above the sea the method is both simple and reliable
the medical stores for sledging were given by a london firm and the way in which the things were packed speaks for the whole outfit there is not a speck of rust on needles scissors knives or anything else although they have been exposed to much damp
our own medical outfit which was bought in christiania and according to the vendors statement unusually well packed became in a short time so damaged that the whole of it is now entirely spoilt the sledging provisions must be mentioned briefly
i have already spoken of the pemmican i have never considered it necessary to take a whole grocers shop with me when sledging the food should be simple and nourishing and that is enough a rich and varied menu is for people who have no work to do
besides the pemmican we had biscuits milk powder and chocolate the biscuits were a present from a well known norwegian factory and did all honour to their origin they were specially baked for us and were made of oatmeal with the addition of dried milk and a little sugar
they were extremely nourishing and pleasant to the taste thanks to efficient packing they kept fresh and crisp all the time these biscuits formed a great part of our daily diet and undoubtedly contributed in no small degree to the successful result
milk powder is a comparatively new commodity with us but it deserves to be better known it came from the district of jaederen neither heat nor cold dryness nor wet could hurt it
we had large quantities of it lying out in small thin linen bags in every possible state of the weather the powder was as good the last day as the first we also took dried milk from a firm in wisconsin this milk had an addition of malt and sugar
and was in my opinion excellent it also kept good the whole time the chocolate came from a world renowned firm and was beyond all praise the whole supply was a very acceptable gift
steventon is a small rural village upon the chalk hills of north hants situated in a winding valley about seven miles from basingstoke the south western railway crosses it by a short embankment
and as it curves round presents a good view of it on the left hand to those who are travelling down the line about three miles before entering the tunnel under popham beacon it may be known to some sportsmen as lying in one of the best portions of the vine hunt
it is certainly not a picturesque country it presents no grand or extensive views but the features are small rather than plain the surface continually swells and sinks but the hills are not bold nor the valleys deep
and though it is sufficiently well clothed with woods and hedgerows yet the poverty of the soil in most places prevents the timber from attaining a large size still it has its beauties the lanes wind along in a natural curve
continually fringed with irregular borders of native turf and lead to pleasant nooks and corners one who knew and loved it well very happily expressed its quiet charms when he wrote true taste is not fastidious
nor rejects because they may not come within the rule of composition pure and picturesque unnumbered simple scenes which fill the leaves of natures sketch book of this somewhat tame country steventon from the fall of the ground and the abundance of its timber
is certainly one of the prettiest spots
compared with the broad river the rich valley and the noble hills which she had been accustomed to behold at her native home near henley upon thames the house itself stood in a shallow valley surrounded by sloping meadows well sprinkled with elm trees at the end of a small village of cottages
each well provided with a garden scattered about prettily on either side of the road it was sufficiently commodious to hold pupils in addition to a growing family and was in those times considered to be above the average of parsonages
no cornice marked the junction of wall and ceiling while the beams which supported the upper floors projected into the rooms below in all their naked simplicity covered only by a coat of paint or whitewash
and about forty five years ago it was pulled down for the purpose of erecting a new house in a far better situation on the opposite side of the valley
on the south side the ground rose gently and was occupied by one of those old fashioned gardens in which vegetables and flowers are combined flanked and protected on the east by one of the thatched mud walls common in that country and overshadowed by fine elms
along the upper or southern side of this garden ran a terrace of the finest turf
but the chief beauty of steventon consisted in its hedgerows a hedgerow in that country does not mean a thin formal line of quickset but an irregular border of copse wood and timber often wide enough to contain within it a winding footpath or a rough cart track
and now and then the unwelcome adder two such hedgerows radiated as it were from the parsonage garden one a continuation of the turf terrace proceeded westward forming the southern boundary of the home meadows
and was formed into a rustic shrubbery with occasional seats entitled the wood walk the other ran straight up the hill under the name of the church walk because it led to the parish church
who have for more than a century rented it together with the chief farm in the parish the church itself i speak of it as it then was before the improvements made by the present rector
might have appeared mean and uninteresting to an ordinary observer but the adept in church architecture would have known that it must have stood there some seven centuries and would have found beauty in the very narrow early english windows
while its solitary position far from the hum of the village and within sight of no habitation except a glimpse of the gray manor house through its circling screen of sycamores has in it something solemn and appropriate to the last resting place of the silent dead
sweet violets both purple and white grow in abundance beneath its south wall one may imagine for how many centuries the ancestors of those little flowers have occupied that undisturbed sunny nook
thick coming fancies rose in her mind and gradually assumed the forms in which they came forth to the world
the family was unbroken by death and seldom visited by sorrow their situation had some peculiar advantages beyond those of ordinary rectories steventon was a family living mister knight the patron was also proprietor of nearly the whole parish
they shared with the principal tenant the command of an excellent manor and enjoyed in this reflected way some of the consideration usually awarded to landed proprietors
they had enough to afford a good education to their sons and daughters to mix in the best society of the neighbourhood and to exercise a liberal hospitality to their own relations and friends a carriage and a pair of horses were kept
this might imply a higher style of living in our days than it did in theirs there were then no assessed taxes the carriage once bought entailed little further expense and the horses probably like mister bennets were often employed on farm work
moreover it should be remembered that a pair of horses in those days were almost necessary if ladies were to move about at all
when one looks at the few specimens still remaining of coach building in the last century it strikes one that the chief object of the builders must have been to combine the greatest possible weight with the least possible amount of accommodation
the family lived in close intimacy with two cousins edward and jane cooper the children of missus austens eldest sister and doctor cooper the vicar of sonning near reading the coopers lived for some years at bath
i believe that cassandra and jane sometimes visited them there and that jane thus acquired the intimate knowledge of the topography and customs of bath which enabled her to write northanger abbey long before she resided there herself
after the death of their own parents the two young coopers paid long visits at steventon edward cooper did not live undistinguished
and in later life he was known by a work on prophecy called the crisis and other religious publications especially for several volumes of sermons much preached in many pulpits in my youth
jane cooper was married from her uncles house at steventon to captain afterwards sir thomas williams under whom charles austen served in several ships she was a dear friend of her namesake
but was fated to become a cause of great sorrow to her for a few years after the marriage she was suddenly killed by an accident to her carriage there was another cousin closely associated with them at steventon
who must have introduced greater variety into the family circle this was the daughter of mister austens only sister missus hancock
of whom i know little more than that he perished by the guillotine during the french revolution perhaps his chief offence was his rank but it was said that the charge of incivism under which he suffered rested on the fact of his having laid down some arable land into pasture
his wife escaped through dangers and difficulties to england was received for some time into her uncles family and finally married her cousin henry austen
she and her second husband went to france in the hope of recovering some of the counts property and there narrowly escaped being included amongst the detenus orders had been given by buonapartes government to detain all english travellers
but at the post houses missus henry austen gave the necessary orders herself and her french was so perfect that she passed everywhere for a native
she was a clever woman and highly accomplished after the french rather than the english mode and in those days when intercourse with the continent was long interrupted by war such an element in the society of a country parsonage must have been a rare acquisition
the sisters may have been more indebted to this cousin than to missus la tournelles teaching for the considerable knowledge of french which they possessed she also took the principal parts in the private theatricals in which the family several times indulged
having their summer theatre in the barn and their winter one within the narrow limits of the dining room where the number of the audience must have been very limited on these occasions the prologues and epilogues were written by janes eldest brother
and some of them are very vigorous and amusing jane was only twelve years old at the time of the earliest of these representations and not more than fifteen when the last took place she was however an early observer
and it may be reasonably supposed that some of the incidents and feelings which are so vividly painted in the mansfield park theatricals are due to her recollections of these entertainments some time before they left steventon one great affliction came upon the family
he accompanied this friend to the west indies as chaplain to his regiment and there died of yellow fever to the great concern of his friend and patron who afterwards declared that if he had known of the engagement he would not have permitted him to go out to such a climate
this little domestic tragedy caused great and lasting grief to the principal sufferer and could not but cast a gloom over the whole party the sympathy of jane was probably from her age and her peculiar attachment to her sister
her reviewer in the quarterly of january eighteen twenty one observes concerning the attachment of fanny price to edmund bertram the silence in which this passion is cherished the slender hopes and enjoyments by which it is fed
the restlessness and jealousy with which it fills a mind naturally active contented and unsuspicious the manner in which it tinges every event and every reflection are painted with a vividness and a detail of which we can scarcely conceive any one but a female
and we should almost add a female writing from recollection capable this conjecture however probable was wide of the mark the picture was drawn from the intuitive perceptions of genius not from personal experience
in no circumstance of her life was there any similarity between herself and her heroine in mansfield park
in her youth she had declined the addresses of a gentleman who had the recommendations of good character and connections and position in life of everything in fact except the subtle power of touching her heart
there is however one passage of romance in her history with which i am imperfectly acquainted and to which i am unable to assign name or date or place though i have it on sufficient authority
many years after her death some circumstances induced her sister cassandra to break through her habitual reticence and to speak of it
whose charm of person mind and manners was such that cassandra thought him worthy to possess and likely to win her sisters love when they parted
and cassandra felt no doubt as to his motives but they never again met within a short time they heard of his sudden death i believe that if jane ever loved it was this unnamed gentleman but the acquaintance had been short
any description that i might attempt of the family life at steventon which closed soon after i was born could be little better than a fancy piece
would seem strange to us and should miss many more to which we are accustomed every hundred years and especially a century like the last marked by an extraordinary advance in wealth luxury and refinement of taste as well as in the mechanical arts which embellish our houses
must produce a great change in their aspect these changes are always at work they are going on now but so silently that we take no note of them men soon forget the small objects which they leave behind them as they drift down the stream of life
as pope says nor does lifes stream for observation stay it hurries all too fast to mark their way important inventions such as the applications of steam gas and electricity may find their places in history
who can now record the degrees by which the custom prevalent in my youth of asking each other to take wine together at dinner became obsolete who will be able to fix twenty years hence the date when our dinners began to be carved and handed round by servants
instead of smoking before our eyes and noses on the table to record such little matters would indeed be to chronicle small beer
but which the historian has the greatest difficulty in recovering at that time the dinner table presented a far less splendid appearance than it does now it was appropriated to solid food rather than to flowers fruits and decorations
nor was there much glitter of plate upon it for the early dinner hour rendered candlesticks unnecessary
though not less plentiful and savoury and the bill of fare in one house would not be so like that in another as it is now for family receipts were held in high estimation
and might influence the family dinner for many generations
one house would pride itself on its ham another on its game pie and a third on its superior furmity or tansey pudding beer and home made wines especially mead were more largely consumed vegetables were less plentiful and less various
potatoes were used but not so abundantly as now and there was an idea that they were to be eaten only with roast meat they were novelties to a tenants wife who was entertained at steventon parsonage certainly less than a hundred years ago
and when missus austen advised her to plant them in her own garden she replied no no they are very well for you gentry but they must be terribly costly to rear but a still greater difference would be found in the furniture of the rooms
which would appear to us lamentably scanty there was a general deficiency of carpeting in sitting rooms bed rooms and passages a pianoforte or rather a spinnet or harpsichord was by no means a necessary appendage
it was to be found only where there was a decided taste for music not so common then as now or in such great houses as would probably contain a billiard table there would often be but one sofa in the house and that a stiff angular
uncomfortable article there were no deep easy chairs nor other appliances for lounging for to lie down or even to lean back was a luxury permitted only to old persons or invalids
and a model gentleman of his day that he would have made the tour of europe without ever touching the back of his travelling carriage but perhaps we should be most struck with the total absence of those elegant little articles which now embellish and encumber our drawing room tables
we should miss the sliding bookcases and picture stands
the periodicals and illustrated newspapers above all
a small writing desk with a smaller work box or netting case was all that each young lady contributed to occupy the table for the large family work basket though often produced in the parlour lived in the closet
there must have been more dancing throughout the country in those days than there is now
as if it were a natural production with less fastidiousness as to the quality of music lights and floor many country towns had a monthly ball throughout the winter in some of which the same apartment served for dancing and tea room
to the music of a harpsichord in the house or a fiddle from the village this was always supposed to be for the entertainment of the young people
for she attributes this taste to her favourite heroines
and made of importance many things connected with the ball rooms of those days have now passed into oblivion the barbarous law which confined the lady to one partner throughout the evening must indeed have been abolished before jane went to balls
it must be observed however that this custom was in one respect advantageous to the gentleman inasmuch as it rendered his duties more practicable he was bound to call upon his partner the next morning
to gallop all the country over the last nights partner to behold and humbly hope she caught no cold but the stately minuet still reigned supreme and every regular ball commenced with it it was a slow and solemn movement
expressive of grace and dignity rather than of merriment it abounded in formal bows and courtesies with measured paces forwards backwards and sideways and many complicated gyrations
it was executed by one lady and gentleman amidst the admiration or the criticism of surrounding spectators in its earlier and most palmy days as when sir charles and lady grandison delighted the company by dancing it at their own wedding
the gentleman wore a dress sword and the lady was armed with a fan of nearly equal dimensions addison observes that women are armed with fans as men with swords and sometimes do more execution with them
the graceful carriage of each weapon was considered a test of high breeding the clownish man was in danger of being tripped up by his sword getting between his legs
and i have been told that those ladies who intended to dance minuets used to distinguish themselves from others by wearing a particular kind of lappet on their head dress i have heard also of another curious proof of the respect in which this dance was held
gloves immaculately clean were considered requisite for its due performance while gloves a little soiled were thought good enough for a country dance and accordingly some prudent ladies provided themselves with two pairs for their several purposes
the minuet expired with the last century but long after it had ceased to be danced publicly it was taught to boys and girls in order to give them a graceful carriage hornpipes cotillons and reels were occasionally danced
but the chief occupation of the evening was the interminable country dance in which all could join this dance presented a great show of enjoyment but it was not without its peculiar troubles
the ladies and gentlemen were ranged apart from each other in opposite rows so that the facilities for flirtation or interesting intercourse were not so great as might have been desired by both parties much heart burning and discontent sometimes arose as to who should stand above whom
and especially as to who was entitled to the high privilege of calling and leading off the first dance and no little indignation was felt at the lower end of the room when any of the leading couples retired prematurely from their duties and did not condescend to dance up and down the whole set
we may rejoice that these causes of irritation no longer exist and that if such feelings as jealousy rivalry and discontent ever touch celestial bosoms in the modern ball room they must arise from different and more recondite sources
i am tempted to add a little about the difference of personal habits it may be asserted as a general truth that less was left to the charge and discretion of servants and more was done or superintended by the masters and mistresses
with regard to the mistresses it is i believe generally understood that at the time to which i refer a hundred years ago they took a personal part in the higher branches of cookery as well as in the concoction of home made wines
and distilling of herbs for domestic medicines which are nearly allied to the same art ladies did not disdain to spin the thread of which the household linen was woven some ladies liked to wash with their own hands their choice china after breakfast or tea
as that they took an interest in such occupations and it must be borne in mind how many sources of interest enjoyed by this generation were then closed or very scantily opened to ladies a very small minority of them cared much for literature or science
but i doubt whether the rising generation are equally aware how much gentlemen also did for themselves in those times
than they are now masters eye makes the horse fat and if you would be well served serve yourself some gentlemen took pleasure in being their own gardeners performing all the scientific and some of the manual work themselves
well dressed young men of my acquaintance who had their coat from a london tailor would always brush their evening suit themselves rather than entrust it to the carelessness of a rough servant and to the risks of dirt and grease in the kitchen
for in those days servants halls were not common in the houses of the clergy and the smaller country gentry it was quite natural that catherine morland should have contrasted the magnificence of the offices at northanger abbey with the few shapeless pantries in her fathers parsonage
a young man who expected to have his things packed or unpacked for him by a servant when he travelled
it was thought meritorious on the evening of a hunting day to turn out after dinner lanthorn in hand and visit the stable to ascertain that the horse had been well cared for this was of the more importance because previous to the introduction of clipping about the year eighteen twenty
it was a difficult and tedious work to make a long coated hunter dry and comfortable and was often very imperfectly done of course such things were not practised by those who had gamekeepers and stud grooms and plenty of well trained servants
but they were practised by many who were unequivocally gentlemen and whose grandsons occupying the same position in life may perhaps be astonished at being told that such things were
of course they cannot be universally applicable such details varied in various circles and were changed very gradually
but it is probable that their way of life differed a little from ours
it may be that useful articles which would not now be produced in drawing rooms were hemmed and marked and darned in the old fashioned parlour but all this concerned only the outer life there was as much cultivation and refinement of mind as now
the early hour at which hounds then met may account for this
for they hunted at an early age in a scrambling sort of way upon any pony or donkey that they could procure or in default of such luxuries on foot i have been told that sir francis austen when seven years old
bought on his own account it must be supposed with his fathers permission a pony for a guinea and a half and after riding him with great success for two seasons sold him for a guinea more
the same authority informs me that his first cloth suit was made from a scarlet habit which according to the fashion of the times had been his mothers usual morning dress if all this is true
the future admiral of the british fleet must have cut a conspicuous figure in the hunting field the other peculiarity was that when the roads were dirty the sisters took long walks in pattens this defence against wet and dirt is now seldom seen
the few that remain are banished from good society and employed only in menial work but a hundred and fifty years ago they were celebrated in poetry and considered so clever a contrivance that gay in his trivia
ascribes the invention to a god stimulated by his passion for a mortal damsel and derives the name patten from patty the patten now supports each frugal dame which from the blue eyed patty takes the name
but mortal damsels have long ago discarded the clumsy implement first it dropped its iron ring and became a clog afterwards it was fined down into the pliant galoshe lighter to wear and more effectual to protect
a no less manifest instance of gradual improvement than cowper indicates when he traces through eighty lines of poetry his accomplished sofa back to the original three legged stool
i add the following epigram written by jane austens uncle mister leigh perrot on reading in a newspaper the marriage of captain foote to miss patten through the rough paths of life with a patten your guard may you safely and pleasantly jog
may the knot never slip nor the ring press too hard nor the foot find the patten a clog at the time when jane austen lived at steventon a work was carried on in the neighbouring cottages which ought to be recorded because it has long ceased to exist
this was a better occupation for them than straw plaiting
and did not admit of gadding and gossiping about the village the implement used was a long narrow machine of wood raised on legs furnished at one end with a large wheel and at the other with a spindle on which the flax or wool was loosely wrapped
ballad poetry and fairy tales are full of allusions to it
it was the labour assigned to the ejected nuns by the rough earl who said go spin ye jades go spin it was the employment at which roman matrons and grecian princesses presided amongst their handmaids
heathen mythology celebrated it in the three fates spinning and measuring out the thread of human life
a white gloved arm a voice and a silvery laugh just that no more jimmie dale in his favourite seat an aisle seat some seven or eight rows back from the orchestra stared at the stage
to all outward appearances absorbed in the last act of the play inwardly quite oblivious to the fact that even a play was going on a white gloved arm a voice
and a silvery laugh the words had formed themselves into a sort of singsong refrain that for the last few days had been running through his head a strange enough guiding star to mould and dictate every action in his life
and that was all he had ever seen of her all that he had ever heard of her except those letters of course each of which had outlined the details of some affair for the gray seal to execute
indeed it seemed a great length of time now since he had heard from her even in that way though it was not so many days ago after all perhaps it was the calm as it were that by contrast
had given place to the strenuous months and weeks just past the storm raised by the newspapers at the theft of old luddys diamonds had subsided into sporadic diatribes aimed at the police kline
of the secret service had finally admitted defeat and a shadow no longer skulked day and night at the entrance to the sanctuary and larry the bat bore the government indorsement so to speak of being no more suspicious a character
than that of a disreputable but harmless dope fiend of the underworld larry the bat the gray seal jimmie dale the millionaire
subconsciously telegraphing to his mind the fact that the texture of the paper was hers hers and she must be one of those around him one of those crowding either the row of seats in front or behind
or one of those just passing in the aisle it had fallen at his feet as he had stooped over for his hat but from just exactly what direction he could not tell his eyes eagerly hungrily
critically swept face after face which one was hers what irony she whom he would have given his life to know for whom indeed he risked his life every hour of the twenty four
was close to him now within reach and as far removed as though a thousand miles separated them she was there but he could not recognise a face that he had never seen
with an effort he choked back the bitter impotent laugh that rose to his lips they were talking laughing around him her voice yes
he had once heard that and that he would recognise again he strained to catch to individualise the tone sounds that floated in a medley about him it was useless of course
every effort that he had ever made to find her had been useless she was too clever far too clever for that she too would know that he could and would recognise her voice where he could recognise nothing else
and then suddenly he realised that he was attracting attention level stares from the women returned his gaze
others in the same row of seats as his own were impatiently waiting to get by him with a muttered apology jimmie dale raised the seat of his chair allowing these latter to pass him and then
slipping the letter into his pocketbook he snatched up his hat from the seat rack there was still a chance knowing he was there she would be on her guard but in the lobby among the crowd and unaware of his presence
there was the possibility that if he could reach the entrance ahead of her she too might be talking and laughing as she left the theatre just a single word just a tone that was all he asked
tight packed the mass of people jostled elbowed and pushed good naturedly it was a voice now her voice that he was listening for but though it seemed that every faculty was strained and intent upon that one effort
his eyes too had in no degree relaxed their vigilance and once half grimly half sardonically he smiled to himself
with their prosperous well groomed escorts there was the wowzer over there sleek dapper squirming in and out of the throng with the agility and stealth of a cat as larry the bat he had met the wowzer many times
as indeed he had met and was acquainted with most of the elite of the underworld the wowzer beyond a shadow of doubt in his own profession stood upon a plane entirely by himself among those qualified to speak
poke getter in the united states the crowd thinned in the lobby thinned down to the last few belated stragglers who passed him as he still loitered in the entrance
and disappointment that burned within him stepped out to the pavement and headed down broadway after all he had known it in his heart of hearts all the time it had
always been the same it was only one more occasion added to the innumerable ones that had gone before in which she had eluded him and now there was the letter
automatically he quickened his steps a little it was useless futile profitless for the moment at least to disturb himself over his failure there was the letter
what sudden emergency was the gray seal called upon to face this time what role unrehearsed without warning must he play what story of grim
jimmie dale a block down he turned from broadway out of the theatre crowds that streamed in both directions past him the letter
almost feverishly now he was seeking an opportunity to open and read it unobserved an eagerness upon him that mingled exhilaration at the lure of danger with a sense of premonition that irritably
inevitably was with him at moments such as these it seemed it always seemed that with an unopened letter of hers in his possession it was as though he were about to open a page in the book of fate and read
a pronouncement upon himself that might mean life or death he hurried on people still passed by him too many and then a cafe just ahead
making a corner gave him the opportunity that he sought away from the entrance on the side street the brilliant lights from the windows shone out on a comparatively deserted pavement
there was ample light to read by even as far away from the window as the curb and jimmie dale with an approving nod turned the corner and walked along a few steps until opposite the farthest window but
as he halted here at the edge of the street he glanced quickly behind him at a man whom he had just passed the other had paused at the corner and was staring down the street jimmie dale instantly and nonchalantly produced his cigarette case
selected a cigarette and fastidiously tapped its end on his thumb nail inspector burton in plain clothes he observed musingly to himself i wonder if its just a fluke
or something else well see jimmie dale took a box of matches from his pocket the first would not light
he surveyed the house from the sidewalk watching with a sort of speculative satisfaction a mans shadow that passed constantly to and fro across the drawn blinds of one of the lower windows
the rest of the house was in darkness yes said jimmie dale nodding his head i rather thought so the servants will have retired hours ago its safe enough
i want to see mister thomas h carling cashier of the hudson mercantile national bank its very important said jimmie dale earnestly i am mister carling replied the other what is it
jimmie dale leaned forward from headquarters with a report he said in a low tone ah exclaimed the bank official sharply well its about time ive been waiting up for it
though i expected you would telephone rather than this come in thank you said jimmie dale courteously and stepped into the hall the other closed the front door the servants are in bed of course
he explained as he led the way toward the lighted room this way please behind the other across the hall jimmie dale followed and close at carlings heels entered the room which was fitted up
quite evidently regardless of cost as a combination library and study carling in a somewhat pompous fashion walked straight ahead toward the carved mahogany flat topped desk and as he reached it
waved his hand take a chair he said over his shoulder and then turning in the act of dropping into his own chair grasped suddenly at the edge of the desk instead
and with a low startled cry stared across the room jimmie dale was leaning back against the door that was closed now behind him and on jimmie dales face was a black silk mask
for an instant neither man spoke nor moved then carling spare built dapper in evening clothes edged back from the desk and laughed a little uncertainly
as he smiled in private youve a strange method of securing privacy havent you a bit melodramatic isnt it
jimmie dale smiled indulgently my mask is only for effect he said my name is smith yes said carling i am very stupid thank you
he had reached the other side of the room now and with a quick sudden movement jerked his hand to the dial of the safe that stood against the wall but jimmie dale was quicker without shifting his position his automatic whipped from his pocket
held a disconcerting bead on carlings forehead please dont do that said jimmie dale softly its rather a good make that safe i dare say it would take me half an hour to open it
his voice was rising gradually well sir let me tell you that mister carling said jimmie dale in a low even tone unless you moderate your voice some one in the house might hear you i am quite well aware of that
extracted the key from the door lock held it up for the other to see then dropped it into his pocket and his voice cold before
jimmie dale moved over and stood in front of carling on the other side of the desk and stared silently at the immaculate fashionably groomed figure before him under the prolonged gaze carlings composure
in a measure at least seemed to forsake him he began to drum nervously with his fingers on the desk and shift uneasily in his chair and then from first one pocket and then the other
said jimmie dale slowly i havent counted it your bank was robbed this evening at closing time i understand yes carlings voice was excited now
but you how do you mean that you are returning the money to the bank exactly said jimmie dale carling was once more the pompous bank official
he leaned back and surveyed jimmie dale critically with his little black eyes ah quite so he observed that accounts for the mask but i am still a little in the dark under the circumstances
it is quite impossible that you should have stolen the money yourself and i didnt said jimmie dale i found it hidden in the home of one of your employees
in moynes home up in harlem
youre wiser than you know my man thats what we suspected
ill telephone headquarters to make the arrest at once just a minute interposed jimmie dale gravely i want you to listen to a little story first a story
what has a story got to do with this snapped carling the man has got a home said jimmie dale softly a home and a wife and a little baby girl
you want to plead for him carling flung out gruffly well he should have thought of all that before its quite useless for you to bring it up the man has had his chance already
said carling icily you refuse absolutely jimmie dales voice had a lingering wistful note in it i refuse said carling bluntly i wont have anything to do with it
your bank was robbed to night of one hundred thousand dollars there are ten thousand here the other ninety thousand are in your safe you lie ashen to the lips carling had risen in his chair
you lie he cried do you hear you lie i tell you you lie jimmie dales lips parted ominously sit down he gritted between his teeth the white in carlings face had turned to gray
his lips were working mechanically he sank down again in his chair jimmie dale still leaned over the desk resting his weight on his right elbow the automatic in his right hand covering carling you cur whispered
jimmie dale theres just one reason only one that keeps me from putting a bullet through you while you sit there well get to that in a moment there is that little story first shall i tell it to you now
for the past four years and god knows how many before that youve gone the pace the lavishness of this bachelor establishment of yours is common talk in new york far in excess of a bank cashiers salary
but you were supposed to be a wealthy man in your own right and so in reality you were once but you went through your fortune two years ago
exposure threatening you at any moment why dont you tell me again that i lie carling but now the man made no answer he had sunk a little deeper in his chair
a dawning look of terror in the eyes that held fascinated on jimmie dale you cur said jimmie dale again you cur with your devils work a year ago you saw this night coming
when you must have money or face ruin and exposure you saw it then a year ago the day that moyne concealing nothing of his prison record applied through friends for a position in the bank
your co officials were opposed to his appointment but you do you remember how you pleaded to give the man his chance and in your hellish ingenuity saw your way then out of the trap an ex convict from sing sing
it was enough wasnt it what chance had he jimmie dale paused his left hand clenched until the skin formed whitish knobs over the knuckles carlings tongue sought his lips made a circuit of them
and he tried to speak but his voice was an incoherent muttering ill not waste words said jimmie dale in his grim monotone im not sure enough myself that i could keep my hands off you much longer
the actual details of how you stole the money to day do not matter now a little later perhaps in court but not now you were the last to leave the bank
but before leaving you pretended to discover the theft of a hundred thousand dollars that done up in a paper parcel was even then reposing in your desk you brought the parcel home put it in that safe there
and notified the president of the bank by telephone from here of the robbery suggesting that police headquarters be advised at once he told you to go ahead and act as you saw best you notified the police
the ex convict in the banks employ you knew moyne was dining out to night you knew where and at a hint from you the police took up the trail a little later in the evening you took these two packages of banknotes from the rest
and with this steamship ticket which you obtained yesterday while out at lunch by sending a district messenger boy with the money and instructions in a sealed envelope to purchase for you you went up to the moynes flat
in harlem for the purpose of secreting them somewhere there you pretended to be much disappointed at finding moyne out you had just come for a little social visit
to get better acquainted with the home life of your employees missus moyne was genuinely pleased and grateful
who was already asleep in bed
you jimmie dales voice choked again you blot on gods earth you slipped the money and ticket under the childs mattress carling came forward with a lurch in his chair and his hands went out
and it was safer much more circumspect on your part not to order the flat searched at once but only as a last resort as it were after you had led the police to trail him all evening and still remain without a clew
and besides of course not until you had planted the evidence that was to damn him and wreck his life and home you were even generous in the amount you deprived yourself of out of the hundred thousand dollars
evidence that he had done the job and had the balance somewhere what would his denials his protestations of innocence count for he was an ex convict a hardened criminal caught red handed with a portion of the proceeds of robbery
and then jimmie dale laughed not pleasantly yes theres a way carling he said grimly thats why im here he picked up a sheet of writing paper and pushed it across the desk then a pen
no he cried i wont i cant my god i i wont the automatic in jimmie dales hand edged forward the fraction of an inch i have not used this yet you understand now why dont you he said under his breath
no no carling pushed away the pen im ruined ruined as it is but this would mean the penitentiary too where you tried to send an innocent man in your place you hound where you some other way
carling was babbling let me out of this for gods sake let me out of this carling said jimmie dale hoarsely i stood beside a little bed to night and looked at a baby girl a little baby girl with golden hair
who smiled as she slept carling shivered and passed a shaking hand across his face take this pen said jimmie dale monotonously or this the automatic
lifted until the muzzle was on a line with carlings eyes carlings hand reached out still shaking and took the pen and his body dragged limply forward hung over the desk
the pen spluttered on the paper a bead of sweat spurting from the mans forehead dropped to the sheet there was silence in the room a minute passed another
carlings pen travelled haltingly across the paper then with a queer low cry as he signed his name he dropped the pen from his fingers and rising unsteadily from his chair
i guess its all up i guess i knew it would be some day moyne hadnt anything to do with it i stole the money myself from the bank to night i guess its all up
thomas h carling from the paper jimmie dales eyes shifted to the figure by the couch and the paper fluttered suddenly from his fingers to the desk carling was reeling clutching at his throat
a small glass vial rolled upon the carpet and then even as jimmie dale sprang forward the other pitched head long over the couch and in a moment it was over presently jimmie dale picked up the vial
and dropped it back on the floor again there was no label on it but it needed none the strong penetrating odor of bitter almonds was telltale evidence enough it was prussic
or hydrocyanic acid probably the most deadly poison and the swiftest in its action that was known to science carling had provided against that some day in his confession for a little space
motionless jimmie dale stood looking down at the silent outstretched form then he walked slowly back to the desk and slowly deliberately picked up the signed confession and the steamship ticket he held them an instant
staring at them then methodically began to tear them into little pieces a strange tired smile hovering on his lips the man was dead now there would be disgrace enough for some one to bear a mother perhaps
who knew and there was another way now since the man was dead jimmie dale put the pieces in his pocket went to the safe opened it and took out a parcel locked the safe carefully
and carried the parcel to the desk he opened it there inside were nearly two dozen little packages of hundred dollar bills the other two packages that he had brought with him he added to the rest
from his pocket he took out the thin metal insignia case and with the tiny tweezers lifted up one of the gray coloured diamond shaped paper seals he moistened the adhesive side and
still holding it by the tweezers dropped it on his handkerchief and pressed the seal down on the face of the topmost package of banknotes he tied the parcel up then and picking up the pen addressed it in printed characters
with the parcel under his arm stepped to the door and unlocked it he paused for an instant on the threshold for a single quick comprehensive glance around the room then passed on out into the street
at the corner he stopped to light a cigarette and the flame of the match spurting up disclosed a face that was worn and haggard he threw the match away smiled a little wearily and went on
i told him what snap and i had learned the rays from the moon proving that grantline had concentrated a considerable ore body i also told him of grantlines message well stop on the way back as he directs gregg he bent closer to me
at ferrok shahn im going to bring back a cordon of interplanetary police the secret will be out of course when we stop at the moon we have no right even now to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is he was very solemn
and he was grim when i told him of the invisible eavesdropper you think he overheard grantlines message who was it you seem to feel it was george prince i told him i was convinced the prowler went into a twenty
when i mentioned the purser who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past carter looked startled johnson is all right gregg does he know anything about this grantline affair no
but why didnt johnson hear that eavesdropper and what was he doing there anyway at that hour of the morning the captain ignored my questions im going to have that prince suite searched we cant be too careful go to bed gregg you need rest
i went to my cabin it was located aft on the stern deck near the stern watch tower a small metal room with a chair a desk and a bunk i made sure no one was in it i sealed the lattice grill and the door
set the alarm trigger against any opening of them and went to bed the siren for the midday meal awakened me i had slept heavily i felt refreshed i found the passengers already assembled at my table when i arrived in the dining salon
it was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow tube lights at its sides the oval windows showed the deck with its ports on the dome side through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible we were well on our course to mars
the moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent earth and behind them our sun blazed visually the largest orb in the heavens it was some sixty eight million miles from the earth to mars
a flight ordinarily of some ten days there were five tables in the dining salon each with eight seats snap and i had one of the tables we sat at the ends with the passengers on each of the sides
gregg this is sero ob hahn i met the keen somber gaze of a venus man of middle age a small slim graceful man with sleek black hair his pointed face accentuated by the pointed beard was pallid
upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament a device like a star and cross entwined i am happy to meet you sir his voice was soft and deep ob hahn i repeated
i should have heard of you no doubt but a smile plucked at his thin gray lips
my mission is that all the universe shall hear of me hes preaching the religion of the venus mystics snap explained and this enlightened gentleman said ob hahn ironically nodding to the man
has just termed it fetishism
protested the man at ob hahns side
and as a matter of fact weve an argument gregg laughed snap this is sir arthur coniston an english gentleman lecturer and sky trotter that is he will be a sky trotter he tells us he plans a number of voyages
the tall englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgement my compliments mister haljan i hope you have no strong religious convictions else we will make your table here very miserable
the third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument snap introduced him as rance rankin an american a quiet blond fellow of thirty five or forty i ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on
i deal in tricks how to fool an audience his keen amused gaze was on ob hahn this gentleman from venus and i have too much in common to argue
i like to eat in quiet arguing passengers always annoy me there were still three seats vacant at our table i wondered who would occupy them i soon learned the answer for one seat at least rankin said calmly
his glance went to the empty seat at my right hand the venza isnt that her name she and i are destined for the same theater in ferrok shahn so venza was to sit beside me it was good news
ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable but the cheerful venza would help she never eats the midday meal said snap shes on the deck having orange juice i guess its the old gag about diet eh
as a man who looked hardly twenty five he was at this moment evidently in a gay mood his clean cut handsome profile with its poetic dark curls
there seemed little of the villain about him and i saw anita prince now as a dark haired black eyed little beauty in feature resembling her brother very strongly she presently finished her meal she rose with him after her
i answered her greeting and met george princes casual gaze he too smiled as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service i had done her or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when i chased him
i gazed after his small white suited figure as he followed anita from the salon and thinking of her i prayed that carter and halsey might be wrong whatever plotting against the grantline expedition might be going on
my attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table i heard ob hahns silky voice we passed quite close to the moon last night mister dean yes said snap we did didnt we always do
its a technical problem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation explain it to them gregg youre an expert i waved it away with a laugh there was a brief silence i could not help noticing sir arthur conistons queer look
and i have never seen so keen a glance as rance rankin shot at me were all three people aware of grantlines treasure on the moon it suddenly seemed so i wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over captain carter was right
coming back we should have a cordon of interplanetary police aboard sir arthur broke the awkward silence magnificent sight the moon from so close though i was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it
when another incident shocked me the two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats a martian girl and man the girl had the seat at my left with the man beside her all martians are tall
the girl was about my own height that is six feet two inches the man was seven feet or more both wore the martian outer robe the girl flung hers back her limbs were encased in pseudomail
she looked as all martians like to look a very warlike amazon but she was a pretty girl she smiled at me with a keen eyed direct gaze mister dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome you are
the martian equivalent of mister and miss
not spindly like most martians this fellow for all his seven feet in height was almost heavy set he wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed as gray hairy pillars of strength
he had come into the salon with a swagger his sword ornament clanking a pleasant voyage so far he said to me as he started his meal his voice had the heavy throaty rasp characteristic of the martian he spoke perfect english
both martians and venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists
had a touch of martian accent worn almost away by living for some years in greater new york the shock to me came within a few minutes
inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm an instant only then it dropped to his wrist but in that instant i had seen upon the gray flesh a thin sear turned red a very recent burn
as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm my mind flung back only last night in the city corridor snap and i had been followed by a martian i had shot at him with a heat ray i thought i had hit him on the arm
i was i think of the planetaras officers the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators the locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was under ordinary circumstances about all i had to do
and it took only a few minutes every twelve hours i had a moment with carter in the isolation of his chart room this voyage gregg im getting like you too fanciful weve a normal group of passengers apparently
but i dont like the look of any of them that ob hahn at your table snaky looking fellow i commented he and the englishman are great on arguments did you have princes cabin searched my breath hung on his answer yes
nothing unusual among his things we searched both his room and his sisters i did not follow that up instead i told him about the burn on mikos thick arm he stared i wish we were at ferrok shahn gregg
tonight when the passengers are asleep come here to me snap will be here and doctor frank we can trust him he knows about about the grantline treasure yes and so do balch and blackstone balch and blackstone were our first and second officers
well all meet here gregg say about the zero hour we must take some precautions then he dismissed me i found venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck a porthole
with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her there was an empty seat nearby she greeted me with the venus form of jocular intimate greeting hola lo gregg sit here with me
i have been wondering when you would come after me i sat down beside her why are you going to mars venza im glad to see you many thanks but i am glad to see you gregg so handsome a man do you know from venus to earth
no man will please me more
dont be silly venza i enjoyed her i gazed at her small slim figure reclining in the deck chair her long gray robe parted by design i have no doubt to display her shapely satin sheathed legs
her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck her carmine lips were parted with a mocking alluring smile the exotic perfume of her enveloped me she glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes
be serious i added i am serious sober intoxicated by you but sober i said what sort of a contract a theater in ferrok shahn good money gregg
she sat up to face me theres a fellow here on the planetara rance rankin he calls himself at our table a big good looking blond american he says he is a magician ever hear of him
thats what he told me no i never heard of him nor did i and i thought i had heard of everyone of importance he is listed for the same theater i am nice sort of fellow she paused then added
if hes a professional entertainer im a motor oiler it startled me why do you say that instinctively my gaze swept the deck an earth woman and child
but not within earshot why do you look so furtive she retorted gregg theres something strange about this voyage
so you must know it as well as i do rance rankin i prompted she leaned closer toward me he could fool you but not me ive known too many magicians she grinned i challenged him to trick me
do you know ob hahn i interrupted she shook her head never heard of him but he told me plenty at breakfast by satan what a flow of words that devil driver can muster he and the englishman dont mesh very well do they
she stared at me i had not answered her grin my mind was too busy with queer fancies halseys words things are not always what they seem were these passengers masqueraders were they put here by george prince
i parried i mean a lot of things what weve just been talking about and what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning excitement gregg you may trust me for the first time she was wholly serious
they anyone somethings going on you know it you are in it i saw you this morning gregg wild eyed chasing a phantom you and i heard the phantom a mans footsteps a magnetic
deflecting invisible cloak you couldnt fool an audience with that its too commonplace if rance rankin tried i gripped her dont ramble venza you saw me yes my stateroom door was open i was sitting with a cigarette
i saw the purser in the smoking room he was visible from wait venza that prowler went through the smoking room i know he did i could hear him
the purser looked up followed the sound with his gaze i thought that was queer he never made a move and then you came along and he acted innocent why whats going on thats what i want to know i held my breath venza
where did the prowler run to can you she whispered calmly
i saw the door open and close i even thought i could see his blurred outline she added why should george prince be sneaking around with you after him and the purser acting innocent
i well i do trust you really i do but the whole thing isnt mine to tell the somber pools of her eyes were shining
heres something i can tell you now weve two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard do you know that who are they shac and dud ardley every detective in greater new york knows them
they had a wonderful game with that englishman sir arthur this morning stripped him of half a pound of eight inch leaves a neat little stack a crooked game of course those fellows are more nimble fingered than rance rankin ever dared to be
i sat staring at her she was a mine of information this girl and gregg i tried my charms on shac and dud nice men but dumb whatevers going on theyre not in it
they wanted to know what kind of a ship this was why because shac has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own he had it working last night he overheard george prince and that
i gasped venza softer against all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself upon me her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear
something about treasure on the moon shac couldnt understand what and they mentioned you then the purser joined them her whispered words tumbled over one another
a hundred pounds of gold leaf thats the pursers price hes with them whatever it is he promised to do something or other for them she stopped well i prompted thats all
shacs current was interrupted tell him to try it again venza ill talk with him no id better let him alone can you get him to keep his mouth shut
hes a man find out what you can she drew away from me abruptly theres anita and george prince they came to the corner of the deck but turned back venza caught my look and understood it
she turned solemn you may be interested to know she loves you i could see it i knew it when i mentioned you to her this morning me why weve hardly spoken is it necessary
doctor franks face had gone white snap stood like a statue of horror the deck here was patched as always with silver radiance from the deck ports the empty deck chairs stood about the scream
was stilled but now we heard a commotion inside the rasp of opening cabin doors questions from frightened passengers i found my voice anita anita prince come on
he was dashing for the lounge archway doctor frank and i followed i realized that we passed the deck door and window of a twenty two but they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside
passengers standing at their cabin doors i shouted go back to your rooms we want order here keep back we came to the twin doors of a twenty two and a twenty both were closed doctor frank was in advance of snap and me now
he paused at the sound of captain carters voice behind us was it from in there wait a moment carter dashed up he had a large heat ray projector in his hand he shoved us aside let me in first is the door sealed
doctor frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon snap and me i was unarmed weapon in hand snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their rooms snap reassured them glibly
moa with a nightrobe drawn tight around her thin tall figure edged up to me what has happened set haljan
i could see only carter but i heard the murmuring voice of doctor frank
the captain rasped get out haljan
he admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again and immediately reopened it gregg keep the passengers quieted tell them everythings all right miss prince got frightened thats all then go to the turret
tell blackstone whats happened but i dont know whats happened carter was grim and white
i dont mean that tell snap to watch his radio room arm yourselves and guard our weapons i stammered if if she dies will you flash us word he stared at me strangely
ill be there presently gregg he slammed the door upon me i followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror the turmoil of the ship gradually quieted snap went to the radio room
blackstone and i sat in the tiny chart room how much time passed i do not know i was confused anita hurt she might die murdered
but why by whom had george prince been in his own room when the attack came i thought now i recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with doctor frank
doctor frank and her brother are with her theyre doing all they can he told us what had happened anita and george prince had both been asleep each in his respective room someone unknown
had opened anitas corridor door wasnt it sealed yes but the intruder opened it burst it
it wasnt broken the assailant opened it somehow and assaulted miss prince shot her in the chest with a heat ray her left lung shot her yes but she did not see who did it
nor did prince her scream awakened him
i was glad enough to get away i would lie down for an hour and then go to anitas stateroom id demand that doctor frank let me see her i went to the stern deck where my cubby was located my mind was
it had only a bunk my tiny desk a chair and clothes robe there was no evidence of any intruder here i set my door and window alarm then i audiphoned to the radio room snap yes
i told him about anita carter cut in on us from the chart room stop that you fools we cut off fully dressed i flung myself on my bed anita might die i must have fallen into a
tortured sleep i was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer someone was tampering with my door then the buzzer ceased the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it but it had done its work awakened me
someone outside trying to unseal the door in the darkness cylinder in hand i crept softly from the bunk crouched at the door this time i would capture or kill this night prowler
the sizzling was faintly audible my door seal was breaking upon impulse i reached for the door jerked it open no one there
was empty but i leaped and struck a solid body crouching in the doorway a giant man
his electronized metallic robe burned my hands i lunged against him i was almost as surprised as he i shot but the stab of heat evidently missed him the shock of my encounter short circuited his robe he materialized in the starlight a brief
savage encounter he struck the weapon from my hand he had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip me but i twisted away from his hold so its you quiet gregg haljan i only want to talk without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand
it caught me ran like ice through my veins seized and numbed my limbs i fell helpless to the deck nerves and muscles paralyzed my tongue was thick and inert i could not speak nor move
and hear him i dont want to kill you haljan we need you he gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms carried me swiftly across the deserted deck
his warning siren rang out to alert the ship his spotlight clung to us miko ran with me a few steps then he cursed and dropped me fled away i fell like a sack of carbide to the deck
my tongue was thick but it moved yes i was soon revived i sat up with doctor frank vigorously rubbing me im all right i told them what had happened
she told us before she died died i leaped to my feet she died yes gregg an hour ago
miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love upon her she repulsed him he killed her it struck me blank and then with a rush came the thought
we must get him i gathered my wits a surge of hate swept me a wild desire for vengeance why by god where is he
doctor frank gripped me the captain said gently we know how you feel gregg she told us before she died ill bring him in here to you but ill kill him i tell you no you wont lad
we dont want him killed not attacked even not yet well explain later they sat me down calming me anita dead
the door of the shining garden was closed a brief glimpse given to me and to her of what might have been and now
it would be a little hard to blame the rector of pennicote that in the course of looking at things from every point of view he looked at gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage
why should he be expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter and wish his niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would approve as the best possible
it is rather to be set down to his credit that his feelings on the subject were entirely good natured and in considering the relation of means to ends it would have been mere folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic
in order that a marquis might fall in love with her or to have insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought she should keep herself out of the way mister gascoignes calculations were of the kind called rational
and he did not even think of getting a too frisky horse in order that gwendolen might be threatened with an accident and be rescued by a man of property he wished his niece well and he meant her to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood
her uncles intention fell in perfectly with gwendolens own wishes but let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant marriage as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on horseback or with any other accomplishment
that she was to be married some time or other she would have felt obliged to admit and that her marriage would not be of a middling kind such as most girls were contented with she felt quietly unargumentatively sure
but her thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her ambition the dramas in which she imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up to that close to be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride was indeed
an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power but to become a wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that condition was on the whole a vexatious necessity her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state
in which a woman could not do what she liked had more children than were desirable was consequently dull and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum of course marriage was social promotion
she could not look forward to a single life but promotions have sometimes to be taken with bitter herbs a peerage will not quite do instead of leadership to the man who meant to lead and this delicate limbed sylph of twenty meant to lead
for such passions dwell in feminine breasts also in gwendolens however they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture and had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the balance of the constitution
her knowledge being such as with no sort of standing room or length of lever could have been expected to move the world she meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner
and to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in which no will was present it was not to be so with her she would no longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself
but would make the very best of the chances that life offered her and conquer circumstances by her exceptional cleverness
the archery club and invitations to dine with the arrowpoints as the highest lights in her scenery was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable chances but gwendolens confidence lay chiefly in herself
she felt well equipped for the mastery of life with regard to much in her lot hitherto she held herself rather hardly dealt with but as to her education she would have admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages
in the school room her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves ignorance from any painful sense of limpness
and what remained of all things knowable she was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted with through novels plays and poems about her french and music the two justifying accomplishments of a young lady she felt no ground for uneasiness
and when to all these qualifications negative and positive we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons are born with so that any subject they turn their attention to impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on it
who can wonder if gwendolen felt ready to manage her own destiny there were many subjects in the world perhaps the majority in which she felt no interest because they were stupid
for subjects are apt to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old but she would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned up in conversation it must be remembered that no one had disputed her power or her general superiority
what will gwendolen think if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots or if the laundresss work was unsatisfactory the maid said this will never do for miss harleth
if the wood smoked in the bedroom fireplace missus davilow whose own weak eyes suffered much from this inconvenience spoke apologetically of it to gwendolen
if when they were under the stress of traveling she did not appear at the breakfast table till every one else had finished the only question was how gwendolens coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest
it was always she herself who had to be tolerant to beg that alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner and that isabel instead of pushing up to her and asking questions would go away to miss merry
always she was the princess in exile who in time of famine was to have her breakfast roll made of the finest bolted flour from the seven thin ears of wheat and in a general decampment was to have her silver fork kept out of the baggage
how was this to be accounted for the answer may seem to lie quite on the surface in her beauty a certain unusualness about her
a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones so that if she came into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the use of things in general was not apparent to them
there seemed to be a sudden sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life and even the waiters at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them
this potent charm added to the fact that she was the eldest daughter toward whom her mamma had always been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils brought on her by a step father may seem so full a reason for gwendolens domestic empire
that to look for any other would be to ask the reason of daylight when the sun is shining but beware of arriving at conclusions without comparison
whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful or euphonious way and who were not eldest daughters with a tender timid mother compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences
some of them were a very common sort of men and the only point of resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was pleasant with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable or dangerous when they did not get it
the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her character the play of various nay contrary tendencies
for macbeths rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the same moment referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to the subtler possibilities of feeling we cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly silent
we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment
chapter twelve o gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dials point still ending at the arrival of an hour shakespeare
on the second day after the archery meeting mister henleigh mallinger grandcourt was at his breakfast table with mister lush everything around them was agreeable
the still life in the room which seemed the stiller for its sober antiquated elegance as if it kept a conscious well bred silence unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident
mister grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn and with his left leg over another chair and his right elbow on the table was smoking a large cigar while his companion was still eating the dogs
gave a vacillating preference first to one gentleman then to the other being dogs in such good circumstances that they could play at hunger and liked to be served with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths all except fetch
the beautiful liver colored water spaniel which sat with its forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward watching grandcourt with unshaken constancy
he held in his lap a tiny maltese dog with a tiny silver collar and bell and when he had a hand unused by cigar or coffee cup it rested on this small parcel of animal warmth
grandcourt looked at her with unchanged face for half a minute and then took the trouble to lay down his cigar while he lifted the unimpassioned fluff close to his chin and gave it caressing pats all the while gravely watching fetch
who poor thing whimpered interruptedly as if trying to repress that sign of discontent and at last rested her head beside the appealing paw looking up with piteous beseeching so at least a lover of dogs must have interpreted fetch
and grandcourt kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them at any rate his impulse to act just in that way started from such an interpretation but when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling bark
that the brute of a cigar required relighting fetch having begun to wail found like others of her sex that it was not easy to leave off indeed the second howl was a louder one and the third was like unto it
turn out that brute will you said grandcourt to lush without raising his voice or looking at him as if he counted on attention to the smallest sign and lush immediately rose lifted fetch though she was rather heavy
shall you ride or drive to quetcham to day i am not going to quetcham you did not go yesterday grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute and then said
i suppose you sent my card and inquiries i went myself at four and said you were sure to be there shortly they would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the intention especially if you go to day
silence for a couple of minutes then grandcourt said what men are invited here with their wives
then there are mister hollis and lady flora and the cushats and the gogoffs rather a ragged lot remarked grandcourt after a while why did you ask the gogoffs
grandcourt like many others had two remarkably different voices hitherto we have heard him speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl suggestive chiefly of languor
and one of your damned musicians but not a comic fellow i wonder if klesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves quetcham nothing but first class music will go down with miss arrowpoint
lush spoke carelessly but he was really seizing an opportunity and fixing an observant look on grandcourt who now for the first time turned his eyes toward his companion but slowly and without speaking until he had given two long luxuriant puffs
when he said perhaps in a lower tone than ever but with a perceptible edge of contempt what in the name of nonsense have i to do with miss arrowpoint and her music
you need not give yourself much trouble perhaps but some forms must be gone through before a man can marry a million very likely but i am not going to marry a million
thats a pity to fling away an opportunity of this sort and knock down your own plans your plans i suppose you mean you have some debts you know and things may turn out inconveniently after all
and the daughters looks and manners require no allowances any more than if she hadnt a sixpence she is not beautiful but equal to carrying any rank and she is not likely to refuse such prospects as you can offer her
perhaps not the father and mother would let you do anything you like with them but i should not like to do anything with them here it was lush who made a little pause before speaking again
and then he said in a deep voice of remonstrance good god grandcourt after your experience will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable settlement in life spare your oratory i know what i am going to do
what lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his side pockets as if he had to face something exasperating but meant to keep his temper i am going to marry the other girl
have you fallen in love this question carried a strong sneer i am going to marry her you have made her an offer already then no she is a young lady with a will of her own i fancy
extremely well fitted to make a rumpus she would know what she liked she doesnt like you said grandcourt with the ghost of a smile perfectly true said lush adding again in a markedly sneering tone
however if you and she are devoted to each other that will be enough grandcourt took no notice of this speech but sipped his coffee rose and strolled out on the lawn all the dogs following him
lush glanced after him a moment then resumed his cigar and lit it but smoked slowly consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers till he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some conclusion and said in a subdued voice
check old boy lush being a man of some ability had not known grandcourt for fifteen years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him though what sort might be useful remained often dubious
in the beginning of his career he held a fellowship and was near taking orders for the sake of a college living but not being fond of that prospect accepted instead the office of traveling companion to a marquess and afterward to young grandcourt
who had lost his father early and who found lush so convenient that he had allowed him to become prime minister in all his more personal affairs the habit of fifteen years had made grandcourt more and more in need of lushs handiness
and lush more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which his transactions on behalf of grandcourt made no interruption worth reckoning i cannot say that the same lengthened habit had intensified grandcourts want of respect for his companion
since that want had been absolute from the beginning but it had confirmed his sense that he might kick lush if he chose only he never did choose to kick any animal because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude
and a gentlemans dogs should be kicked for him he only said things which might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confidant had been a man of independent spirit
but what son of a vicar who has stinted his wife and daughters of calico in order to send his male offspring to oxford can keep an independent spirit when he is bent on dining with high discrimination riding good horses
living generally in the most luxuriant honey blossomed clover and all without working mister lush had passed for a scholar once and had still a sense of scholarship when he was not trying to remember much of it
since in his own opinion he had never done a bad action it did not seem necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit one if his love of ease required it lushs love of ease was well satisfied at present
and if his puddings were rolled toward him in the dust he took the inside bits and found them relishing
all things are changes not into nothing but into that which is not at present marcus aurelius
deeds are the pulse of time his beating life and righteous or unrighteous being done must throb in after throbs till time itself be laid in darkness
and the universe quiver and breathe upon no mirror more in the evening she sent for him again it was already near the hour at which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before
and the light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open she was seated gazing fixedly on the sea resting her cheek on her hand looking less shattered than when he had left her but with a deep melancholy in her expression
which as deronda approached her passed into an anxious timidity she did not put out her hand but said how long ago it is then will you sit near me again a little while
and again turned with the same expression which yet did not issue in speech there was some fear hindering her and deronda wishing to relieve her timidity averted his face
presently he heard her cry imploringly you will not say that any one else should know most decidedly not said deronda there is no action that ought to be taken in consequence
but if i had not had that murderous will that moment if i had thrown the rope on the instant perhaps it would have hindered death no i think not said deronda slowly
if it were true that he could swim he must have been seized with cramp with your quickest utmost effort it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save him
that momentary murderous will cannot i think have altered the course of events its effect is confined to the motives in your own breast within ourselves our evil will is momentous
and sooner or later it works its way outside us it may be in the vitiation that breeds evil acts but also it may be in the self abhorrence that stings us into better striving i am saved from robbing others
she spoke hesitatingly i had not thought of them said deronda i was thinking too much of the other things perhaps you dont quite know the beginning of it all said gwendolen slowly as if she were overcoming her reluctance
there was some one else he ought to have married and i knew it and i told her i would not hinder it and i went away that was when you first saw me
but then we became poor all at once and i was very miserable and i was tempted i thought i shall do as i like and make everything right i persuaded myself and it was all different it was all dreadful
then came hatred and wicked thoughts that was how it all came i told you i was afraid of myself
if you did not know how miserable i was you might but now it has all been no use i can care for nothing but saving the rest from knowing poor mamma
worth anything worthy enough i shall always be too wicked to the voice broke off helpless derondas heart was pierced he turned his eyes on her poor beseeching face and said
i believe that you may become worthier than you have ever yet been worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing no evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love and desire to continue in
and make no effort to escape from you have made efforts you will go on making them but you were the beginning of them you must not forsake me said gwendolen leaning with her clasped hands on the arm of her chair and looking at him
while her face bore piteous traces of the life experience concentrated in the twenty four hours that new terrible life lying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a criminal desire i will bear any penance
i will lead any life you tell me but you must not forsake me you must be near if you had been near me if i could have said everything to you i should have been different you will not forsake me
it could never be my impulse to forsake you said deronda promptly with that voice which like his eyes had the unintentional effect of making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really was
and in that moment he was not himself quite free from a foreboding of some such self committing effect his strong feeling for this stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty
to an indefinite hope anxieties both immediate and distant crowded on his thought and it was under their influence that after a moments silence he said
and i am not without hope that missus davilow may shortly follow him her presence will be the greatest comfort to you it will give you a motive to save her from unnecessary pain yes yes i will try and you will not go away
not till after sir hugo has come but we shall all go to england as soon as possible said deronda not wishing to enter into particulars
gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts the twilight was perceptibly deepening
or else at diplow i am quite uncertain where i shall live said deronda coloring she was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly and fell silent
when you are among your friends again you will discern new duties said deronda make it a task now to get as well and calm as much like yourself as you can before he hesitated
before my mother comes said gwendolen ah i must be changed i have not looked at myself should you have known me she added turning toward him if you had met me now
should you have known me for the one you saw at leubronn yes i should have known you said deronda mournfully the outside change is not great i should have seen at once that it was you and that you had gone through some great sorrow
dont wish now that you had never seen me dont wish that said gwendolen imploringly while the tears gathered i should despise myself for wishing it said deronda how could i know what i was wishing
we must find our duties in what comes to us not in what we imagine might have been if i took to foolish wishing of that sort i should wish not that i had never seen you but that i had been able to save you from this
you have saved me from worse said gwendolen in a sobbing voice
it will be better for me to go now said deronda worn in spirit by the perpetual strain of this scene remember what we said of your task to get well and calm before other friends come
he rose as he spoke and she gave him her hand submissively but when he had left her she sank on her knees in hysterical crying the distance between them was too great
beholding a possible life which she had sinned herself away from
this book owes its origin to the fact that in the autumn of nineteen twenty one the authorities of manchester college oxford invited me to deliver the inaugural course of a lectureship in religion newly established under the will of the late professor upton
no conditions being attached to this appointment it seemed a suitable opportunity to discuss so far as possible in the language of the moment some of the implicits which i believe to underlie human effort
and achievement in the domain of the spiritual life the material gathered for this purpose has now been added to revised and to some extent re written
or who are offended by the resulting demonstrations of continuity between our most homely and most lofty reactions to the universe might take to themselves the plain words of thomas a kempis thou art a man and not god thou art flesh
and no angel since my subject is not the splendor of historic sanctity but the normal life of the spirit as it may be and is lived in the here and now
no attention has been given to those abnormal experiences and states of consciousness which too often regarded as specially mystical are now recognized by all competent students as representing the unfortunate accidents
rather than the abiding substance of spirituality readers of these pages will find nothing about trances ecstasies and other rare psychic phenomena which sometimes indicate holiness and sometimes only disease
for information on these matters they must go to larger and more technical works my aim here is the more general one of indicating first the characteristic experiences discoverable within all great religions
which justify or are fundamental to the spiritual life and the way in which these experiences may be accommodated to the world view of the modern man and next the nature of that spiritual life as it appears in human history
the succeeding sections of the book treat in some detail the light cast on spiritual problems by mental analysis a process which need not necessarily be conducted from the standpoint of a degraded materialism
and by recent work on the psychology of autistic thought and of suggestion these investigations have a practical interest for every man who desires to be the captain of his soul
the relation in which institutional religion does or should stand to the spiritual life is also in part a matter for psychology which is here called upon to deal with the religious aspect of the social instincts
and the problems surrounding symbols and cults these chapters lead up to a discussion of the personal aspect of the spiritual life its curve of growth characters and activities
and a further section suggests some ways in which educationists might promote the up springing of this life in the young finally the last chapter attempts to place the fact of the life of the spirit in its relation to the social order
and to indicate some of the results which might follow upon its healthy corporate development it is superfluous to point out that each of these subjects needs at least a volume to itself
warm gratitude first to the principal and authorities of manchester college who gave me the opportunity of delivering these chapters in their original form and whose unfailing sympathy and kindness so greatly helped me
psychology and the life of the spirit two contemplation and suggestion
chapter two roses and thorns by the soft green light in the woody glade on the banks of moss where thy childhood played by the household tree
her mother had been detained at home by a multitude of half reasons none of which anybody fully understood except mister hale who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown
which was midway between oldness and newness had proved unavailing and that as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh from top to toe she would not show herself at her only sisters only childs wedding
if missus shaw had guessed at the real reason why missus hale did not accompany her husband she would have showered down gowns upon her but it was nearly twenty years since missus shaw had been the poor pretty miss beresford
and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life on which she could descant by the half hour dearest maria had married the man of her heart
only eight years older than herself with the sweetest temper and that blue black hair one so seldom sees mister hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard and a perfect model of a parish priest
perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these premises but it was still missus shaws characteristic conclusion as she thought over her sisters lot
missus hale if she spoke truth might have answered with a ready made list
a white chip bonnet oh dozens of things for the wedding and hundreds of things for the house margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come
and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting would take place at helstone parsonage rather than during the confusion of the last two or three days in the house in harley street where she herself had had to play the part of figaro
and was wanted everywhere at one and the same time her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty eight hours the farewells so hurriedly taken amongst all the other good byes
of those she had lived with so long oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more it did not signify what those times had been they were gone never to return margarets heart felt more heavy
the place and the life she had longed for for years at that time of all times for yearning and longing just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep
her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage his blue black hair was grey now and lay thinly over his brows the bones of his face were plainly to be seen
too plainly for beauty if his features had been less finely cut as it was they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own the face was in repose but it was rather rest after weariness
than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid contented life margaret was painfully struck by the worn anxious expression and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her fathers life
to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression poor frederick thought she sighing oh if frederick had but been a clergyman instead of going into the navy and being lost to us all
i wish i knew all about it i never understood it from aunt shaw i only knew he could not come back to england because of that terrible affair poor dear papa how sad he looks
i am so glad i am going home to be at hand to comfort him and mamma she was ready with a bright smile in which there was not a trace of fatigue to greet her father when he awakened he smiled back again but
faintly as if it were an unusual exertion his face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety he had a trick of half opening his mouth as if to speak which constantly unsettled the form of the lips
and gave the face an undecided expression but he had the same large soft eyes as his daughter eyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids
no rosebud that could only open just enough to let out a yes and no and ant please you sir but the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips and the skin if not white and fair
was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy if the look on her face was in general too dignified and reserved for one so young now talking to her father it was bright as the morning
full of dimples and glances that spoke of childish gladness and boundless hope in the future it was the latter part of july when margaret returned home the forest trees were all one dark full dusky green
the fern below them caught all the slanting sunbeams the weather was sultry and broodingly still margaret used to tramp along by her fathers side crushing down the fern with a cruel glee
as she felt it yield under her light foot and send up the fragrance peculiar to it out on the broad commons into the warm scented light seeing multitudes of wild free living creatures revelling in the sunshine
this life at least these walks realised all margarets anticipations she took a pride in her forest its people were her people she made hearty friends with them
learned and delighted in using their peculiar words took up her freedom amongst them nursed their babies talked or read with slow distinctness to their old people
carried dainty messes to their sick resolved before long to teach at the school where her father went every day as to an appointed task but she was continually tempted off to go and see some individual friend
man woman or child in some cottage in the green shade of the forest her out of doors life was perfect her in doors life had its drawbacks
with the healthy shame of a child she blamed herself for her keenness of sight in perceiving that all was not as it should be there her mother her mother always so kind and tender towards her
but every day he was more overpowered the world became more bewildering at each repeated urgency of his wife that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment
and margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful broad upland sun streaked cloud shadowed common for she was sure that her mother had accustomed herself too much to an in doors life seldom extending her walks beyond the church
the school and the neighbouring cottages this did good for a time but when the autumn drew on and the weather became more changeable her mothers idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased
and she repined even more frequently that her husband who was more learned than mister hume a better parish priest than mister houldsworth should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done
that she should have to give up many luxuries which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in harley street her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure was balanced finely if not overbalanced
by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all if need were but the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it there had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mothers part
not so pleasant in the latter half of september the autumnal rains and storms came on and margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done
helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation it is undoubtedly one of the most out of the way places in england said missus hale in one of her plaintive moods
if we only lived at the other side of the parish it would be something there we should be almost within walking distance of the stansfields certainly the gormans would be within a walk gormans said margaret
are those the gormans who made their fortunes in trade at southampton oh im glad we dont visit them i dont like shoppy people i think we are far better off knowing only cottagers and labourers
i call mine a very comprehensive taste i like all people whose occupations have to do with land i like soldiers and sailors and the three learned professions as they call them
and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her as she crossed some heath she seemed to be borne onwards as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze
but the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably immediately after tea her father withdrew into his small library and she and her mother were left alone missus hale had never cared much for books
and had discouraged her husband very early in their married life in his desire of reading aloud to her while she worked at one time they had tried backgammon as a resource but as mister hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners
he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose
so he withdrew while the children were yet young into his library to spend his evenings if he were at home in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight
when margaret had been here before she had brought down with her a great box of books recommended by masters or governess and had found the summers day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town
now there were only the well bound little read english classics which were weeded out of her fathers library to fill up the small book shelves in the drawing room thomsons seasons hayleys cowper middletons cicero
were by far the lightest newest and most amusing the book shelves did not afford much resource margaret told her mother every particular of her london life to all of which missus hale listened with interest
sometimes amused and questioning at others a little inclined to compare her sisters circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at helstone vicarage on such evenings margaret was apt to stop talking rather abruptly
once or twice margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of the monotonous sound while she wondered if she might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart and ask where frederick was now
the full account of which margaret had never heard and which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion
when she was with her mother her father seemed the best person to apply to for information and when with him
his room was kept exactly as he had left it and was regularly dusted and put into order by dixon missus hales maid who touched no other part of the household work
but always remembered the day when she had been engaged by lady beresford as ladies maid to sir johns wards the pretty miss beresfords the belles of rutlandshire
alias her married life she remained with her and was devoted to her interests always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy whose duty it was to baffle the malignant giant mister hale
he would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death bed or hearing of any crime but now margaret noticed an absence of mind as if his thoughts were pre occupied by some subject
the oppression of which could not be relieved by any daily action such as comforting the survivors or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come mister hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as usual
a signal which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to understand what it was and attend to him now mister hale loitered about the garden if the morning was fine and if not
half confidential shake of the head to the parson who watched him away beyond the sweet briar hedge and past the great arbutus before he turned into the room to begin his days work with all the signs of a heavy heart
not absolutely based on a knowledge of facts is easily banished for a time by a bright sunny day or some happy outward circumstance and when the brilliant fourteen fine days of october came on
she had learnt drawing with edith and she had sufficiently regretted during the gloom of the bad weather her idle revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been fine to make her determined to sketch what she could
before winter fairly set in accordingly she was busy preparing her board one morning when sarah the housemaid threw wide open the drawing room door and announced
chapter twelve morning calls well i suppose we must friends in council
mister thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the desired point of civility she did not often make calls and when she did it was in heavy state that she went through her duties
but she refused to let him keep horses for it they were hired for the solemn occasions when she paid morning or evening visits she had had horses for three days not a fortnight before
who might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn yet crampton was too far off for her to walk and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cab hire
the last time you were out in a cab you came home with a headache from the jolting i never complained of it im sure no
but so much the more i have to watch over you now as for fanny there a little hardship would do her good she is not made of the same stuff as you are john she could not bear it
missus thornton was silent after this for her last words bore relation to a subject which mortified her she had an unconscious contempt for a weak character and fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong
missus thornton was not a woman much given to reasoning her quick judgment and firm resolution served her in good stead of any long arguments and discussions with herself she felt instinctively that nothing could strengthen fanny to endure hardships patiently
which the uneasy tenderness of missus thorntons manner to her daughter the shame with which she thought to hide the poverty of her child in all the grand qualities which she herself possessed unconsciously and which she set so high a value upon in others
this shame i say betrayed the want of a secure resting place for her affection she never called her son by any name but john love and dear and such like terms were reserved for fanny
but her heart gave thanks for him day and night and she walked proudly among women for his sake fanny dear i shall have horses to the carriage to day to go and call on these hales
with what asked missus thornton her brow slightly contracting
missus thornton did not speak but she laid her work on the table and seemed to think it will be a long way for her to walk back at night
at this point mister thornton came in just before going to the mill mother i need hardly say that if there is any little thing that could serve missus hale as an invalid you will offer it im sure if i can find it out i will
it will do you good instead of harm
he went abruptly out of the room after saying this if he had staid a minute longer fanny would have cried at his tone of command even when he used the words you will oblige me
fanny dont speak so of your brother he has good reasons of some kind or other or he would not wish us to go make haste and put your things on
but the little altercation between her son and her daughter did not incline missus thornton more favourably towards these hales her jealous heart repeated her daughters question
missus thornton was shy it was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society and as society she did not enjoy it
as dinner giving and as criticising other peoples dinners she took satisfaction in it but this going to make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing
as missus thornton observed to herself she liked missus hales double knitting far better that was sensible of its kind the room altogether was full of knick knacks which must take a long time to dust and time to people of limited income was money
missus hale was making rather more exertion in her answers captivated by some real old lace which missus thornton wore lace as she afterwards observed to dixon of that old english point which has not been made for this seventy years and
which cannot be bought it must have been an heir loom and shows that she had ancestors so the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor
fifteen shillings a week and three saved out of them thought margaret to herself but she must have been very young she probably has forgotten her own personal experience but she must know of those days
margarets manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next spoke you have good concerts here i believe
too crowded that is the worst
but surely it is a very easy journey to london yes but somehow said fanny lowering her voice mamma has never been to london herself and cant understand my longing
may i inquire margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question which took her a little by surprise so miss thornton replied
as fanny had put it it did seem as if they had been impertinently discussing missus thorntons feelings but she also rose up against that ladys manner of showing that she was offended missus thornton went on after a moments pause
do you know anything of milton miss hale have you seen any of our factories our magnificent warehouses no said margaret i have not seen anything of that description as yet
then she felt that by concealing her utter indifference to all such places she was hardly speaking with truth so she went on
every improvement of machinery is i believe to be seen there in its highest perfection i am so glad you dont like mills and manufactories and all those kind of things said fanny in a half whisper
she will do you no good i see the mother looks very ill and seems a nice quiet kind of person
he received from missus lowder on the morning after his visit to kate the telegraphic expression of a hope that he might be free to dine with them that evening and his freedom affected him as fortunate even though in some degree qualified by her missive
expecting american friends whom im so glad to find you know his knowledge of american friends was clearly an accident of which he was to taste the fruit to the last bitterness this apprehension however we hasten to add
enjoyed for him in the immediate event a certain merciful shrinkage the immediate event being that at lancaster gate five minutes after his due arrival prescribed him for eight thirty missus stringham came in alone
the long daylight the postponed lamps the habit of the hour made dinners late and guests still later so that punctual as he was he had found missus lowder alone with kate herself not yet in the field
he had thus had with her several bewildering moments bewildering by reason fairly of their tacit invitation to him to be supernaturally simple this was exactly goodness knew what he wanted to be
but he had never had it so largely and freely so supernaturally simply for that matter imputed to him as of easy achievement it was a particular in which aunt maud appeared to offer herself as an example appeared to say quite agreeably
what i want of you dont you see is to be just exactly as i am the quantity of the article required was what might especially have caused him to stagger he liked so in general the quantities in which missus lowder dealt
he would have liked as well to ask her how feasible she supposed it for a poor young man to resemble her at any point but he had after all soon enough perceived that he was doing as she wished by letting his wonder show
just a little as silly he was conscious moreover of a small strange dread of the results of discussion with her strange truly because it was her good nature not her asperity that he feared asperity might have made him angry
in which there was always a comfort good nature in his conditions had a tendency to make him ashamed which aunt maud indeed wonderfully liking him for himself quite struck him as having guessed to spare him therefore she also avoided discussion
she kept him down by refusing to quarrel with him this was what she now proposed to him to enjoy and his secret discomfort was his sense that on the whole it was what would best suit him being kept down was a bore but
his great dread verily was of being ashamed which was a thing distinct and it mattered but little that he was ashamed of that too it was of the essence of his position that in such a house as this the tables could always be turned on him
the place however muffled in convenience and decorum constantly hummed for him with that thick irony
and he had already seen how little aid came to him from denouncing the bribes as ugly in form that was what the precious metals they alone could afford to be it was vain enough for him accordingly to try to impart a gloss to his own comparative brummagem
the humiliation of this impotence was precisely what aunt maud sought to mitigate for him by keeping him down and as her effort to that end had doubtless never yet been so visible he had probably never felt so definitely placed in the world
as while he waited with her for her half dozen other guests she welcomed him genially back from the states as to his view of which her few questions though not coherent were comprehensive
and he had the amusement of seeing in her as through a clear glass the outbreak of a plan and the sudden consciousness of a curiosity she became aware of america under his eyes as a possible scene for social operations
the idea of a visit to the wonderful country had clearly but just occurred to her yet she was talking of it at the end of a minute as her favourite dream he didnt believe in it but he pretended to this helped her as well as anything else
to treat him as harmless and blameless she was so engaged with the further aid of a complete absence of allusions when the highest effect was given her method by the beautiful entrance of kate the method therefore received support all round
for no young man could have been less formidable than the person to the relief of whose shyness her niece ostensibly came the ostensible in kate struck him altogether on this occasion as prodigious
while scarcely less prodigious for that matter was his own reading on the spot of the relation between his companions a relation lighted for him by the straight look not exactly loving nor lingering yet searching and soft
that on the part of their hostess the girl had to reckon with as she advanced it took her in from head to foot and in doing so it told a story that made poor densher again the least bit sick it marked so something with which kate habitually
and consummately reckoned that was the story that she was always for her beneficent dragon under arms living up every hour but especially at festal hours to the value missus lowder had attached to her
high and fixed this estimate ruled on each occasion at lancaster gate the social scene so that he now recognised in it something like the artistic idea the plastic substance imposed by tradition by genius by criticism
in respect to a given character on a distinguished actress as such a person was to dress the part to walk to look to speak in every way to express the part so all this was what kate was to do for the character she had undertaken
things all perfectly ponderable to criticism and the way for her to meet criticism was evidently at the start to be sure her make up had had the last touch and that she looked at least no worse than usual
aunt mauds appreciation of that to night was indeed managerial and the performers own contribution fairly that of the faultless soldier on parade densher saw himself for the moment as in his purchased stall at the play
the watchful manager was in the depths of a box and the poor actress in the glare of the footlights but she passed the poor performer he could see how she always passed her wig her paint her jewels every mark of her expression impeccable
and her entrance accordingly greeted with the proper round of applause such impressions as we thus note for densher come and go it must be granted in very much less time than notation demands but we may none the less make the point that there was still further
time among them for him to feel almost too scared to take part in the ovation he struck himself as having lost for the minute his presence of mind so that in any case he only stared in silence at the older womans technical challenge
it was as if the drama it thus came to him for the fact of a drama there was no blinking was between them them quite preponderantly with merton densher relegated to mere spectatorship a paying place in front and one of the most expensive
this was why his appreciation had turned for the instant to fear had just turned as we have said to sickness
that the disciplined face did offer him over the footlights as he believed the small gleam fine faint but exquisite of a special intelligence so might a practised performer even when raked by double barrelled glasses seem to be all in her part
and yet convey a sign to the person in the house she loved best the drama at all events as densher saw it meanwhile went on amplified soon enough by the advent of two other guests stray gentlemen both stragglers in the rout of the season
who visibly presented themselves to kate during the next moments as subjects for a like impersonal treatment and sharers in a like usual mercy at opposite ends of the social course they displayed in respect to the figure
that each in his way made one the expansive the other the contractile effect of the perfect white waistcoat a scratch company of two innocuous youths and a pacified veteran was therefore what now offered itself to missus stringham
her companion at the last moment had been indisposed positively not well enough and so had packed her off insistently with excuses with wild regrets
this circumstance of their charming friends illness was the first thing kate took up with densher on their being able after dinner
naturally as she called it which wasnt what he did together but it was already as if the young man had by an odd impression throughout the meal
missus lowder had made dear milly the topic and it proved on the spot a topic as familiar to the enthusiastic younger as to the sagacious older man any knowledge they might lack missus lowders niece was moreover alert to supply
while densher himself was freely appealed to as the most privileged after all of the group wasnt it he who had in a manner invented the wonderful creature through having seen her first caught her in her native jungle hadnt he more or less paved the way
for her by his prompt recognition of her rarity by preceding her in a friendly spirit as he had the ear of society with a sharp flashlight or two he met poor densher these enquiries as he could
listening with interest yet with discomfort wincing in particular dry journalist as he was to find it seemingly supposed of him that he had put his pen oh his pen at the service of private distinction the ear of society
they were talking or almost as if he had publicly paragraphed a modest young lady they dreamt dreams in truth he appeared to perceive that fairly waked him up and he settled himself in his place
both to resist his embarrassment and to catch the full revelation his embarrassment came naturally from the fact that if he could claim no credit for miss theales success so neither could he gracefully insist on his not having been concerned with her
missus lowder had wonders to tell of it the two wearers of the waistcoat either with sincerity or with hypocrisy professed in the matter an equal expertness and densher at last seemed to know himself in presence of a social case
it was missus stringham obviously whose testimony would have been most invoked hadnt she been as her friends representative rather confined to the function of inhaling the incense so that kate
who treated her beautifully smiling at her cheering and consoling her across the table appeared benevolently both to speak and to interpret for her kate spoke as if she wouldnt perhaps understand their way of appreciating milly
but would let them none the less in justice to their good will express it in their coarser fashion densher himself wasnt unconscious in respect to this of a certain broad brotherhood with missus stringham wondering indeed while he followed the talk how
it might move american nerves he had only heard of them before but in his recent tour he had caught them in the remarkable fact and there was now a moment or two when it came to him that he had perhaps and not in the way of an escape
taken a lesson from them they quivered clearly they hummed and drummed they leaped and bounded in missus stringhams typical organism this lady striking him as before all things excited as in the native phrase keyed up
to a perception of more elements in the occasion than he was himself able to count she was accessible to sides of it he imagined that were as yet obscure to him for though she unmistakeably rejoiced and soared
her little dry new england brightness he had sampled all the shades of the american complexity if complexity it were had its actual reasons for finding relief most in silence
so that before the subject was changed he perceived with surprise at the others that they had given her enough of it
had really not made in her own country the mark she had chalked so large in london
while he scarce knew if he were the more impressed with her launching it under missus stringhams nose or with her hope that he would allow to london the honour of discovery the less expansive of the white waistcoats propounded the theory that they saw in london
for all that was said much further than in the states it wouldnt be the first time he urged that they had taught the americans to appreciate especially when it was funny some native product
but it might very well be that new york in having her to show hadnt been aware of its luck there were plenty of people who were nothing over there and yet were awfully taken up in england just as to make the balance right thank goodness
they sometimes sent out beauties and celebrities who left the briton cold the britons temperature in truth wasnt to be calculated a formulation of the matter that was not reached
she announced that if the point of view for a proper admiration of her young friend had seemed to fail a little in new york there was no manner of doubt of her having carried boston by storm
it pointed the moral that boston for the finer taste left new york nowhere and the good lady as the exponent of this doctrine which she set forth at a certain length made obviously to denshers mind her nearest approach to supplying
the weirdness in which millys absence had left them deficient she made it indeed effective for him by suddenly addressing him you know nothing sir but not the least little bit about my friend
he hadnt pretended he did but there was a purity of reproach in missus stringhams face and tone a purity charged apparently with solemn meanings so that for a little small as had been his claim he couldnt but feel that she exaggerated
but while doing so he defended himself i certainly dont know enormously much beyond her having been most kind to me in new york as a poor bewildered and newly landed alien
and my having tremendously appreciated it to which he added he scarce knew why what had an immediate success remember missus stringham that you werent then present ah there you are said kate with much gay expression
though what it expressed he failed at the time to make out you werent present then dearest missus lowder richly concurred you dont know she continued with mellow gaiety how far things may have gone
it made the little woman he could see really lose her head she had more things in that head than any of them in any other unless perhaps it were kate whom he felt as indirectly watching him during this foolish passage
and because of the foolishness not to meet her eyes he met missus stringhams which affected him with her he could on occasion clear it up a sense produced by the mute communion between them and
really the beginning as the event was to show of something extraordinary it was even already a little the effect of this communion that missus stringham perceptibly faltered in her retort to missus lowders joke
oh its precisely my point that mister densher cant have had vast opportunities and then she smiled at him i wasnt away you know long it made everything in the oddest way in the world immediately right for him
and i wasnt there long either he positively saw with it that nothing for him so far as she was concerned would again be wrong shes beautiful but i dont say shes easy to know
as if now to keep well with him he asked nothing better she was off with you to these parts before i knew it i myself was off too away off to wonderful parts where i had endlessly more to see
but you didnt forget her aunt maud interposed with almost menacing archness
shell thank you for that sir said missus stringham with a flushed firmness yet doesnt silence in such a case aunt maud blandly enquired very often quite prove the depth of the impression
he would have been amused hadnt he been slightly displeased at all they seemed desirous to fasten on him well the impression was as deep as you like but i really want miss theale to know he pursued for missus stringham that i dont figure by any consent of my own
kate came to his assistance if assistance it was before their friend had had time to meet this charge youre right about her not being easy to know one sees her with intensity sees her more than one sees almost any one but then one discovers
that that isnt knowing her and that one may know better a person whom one doesnt see as i say half so much the discrimination was interesting but it brought them back to the fact of her success and it was at that comparatively gross circumstance
now so fully placed before them that millys anxious companion sat and looked looked very much as some spectator in an old time circus might have watched the oddity of a christian maiden in the arena mildly caressingly martyred
it was the nosing and fumbling not of lions and tigers but of domestic animals let loose as for the joke even the joke made missus stringham uneasy and her mute communion with densher to which we have alluded
he wondered afterwards if kate had made this out though it was not indeed till much later on that he found himself in thought dividing the things she might have been conscious of from the things she must have missed
if she actually missed at any rate missus stringhams discomfort that but showed how her own idea held her her own idea was by insisting on the fact of the girls prominence as a feature of the seasons end
to keep densher in relation for the rest of them both to present and to past its everything that has happened since that makes you naturally a little shy about her you dont know what has happened since but we do weve seen it and followed it
weve a little been of it the great thing for him at this as kate gave it was in fact quite irresistibly that the case was a real one the kind of thing that when ones patience was shorter than ones curiosity
one had vaguely taken for possible in london but in which one had never been even to this small extent concerned the little americans sudden social adventure her happy and no doubt harmless flourish
had probably been favoured by several accidents but it had been favoured above all by the simple spring board of the scene by one of those common caprices of the numberless foolish flock gregarious movements as inscrutable
as ocean currents the huddled herd had drifted to her blindly it might as blindly have drifted away
but the great reason was probably the absence at the moment of a larger lion the bigger beast would come and the smaller would then incontinently vanish it was at all events characteristic
and what was of the essence of it was grist to his scribbling mill matter for his journalising hand that hand already in intention played over it the motive as a sign of the season a feature of the time of the purely expeditious
and rough and tumble nature of the social boom the boom as in itself required that would be the note the subject of the process a comparatively minor question anything was boomable enough when nothing else was more so
the author of the rotten book the beauty who was no beauty the heiress who was only that the stranger who was for the most part saved from being inconveniently strange but by being inconveniently familiar
the creature in fine as to whom spangles or spots of any sufficiently marked and exhibited sort could be loudly enough predicated
and the tone of society went so far as to make him take up again his sense of independence he had supposed himself civilised but if this was civilisation one could smoke ones pipe outside when twaddle was within
he had rather avoided as we have remarked kates eyes but there came a moment when he would fairly have liked to put it across the table to her i say light of my life is this the great world
there came another it must be added and doubtless as a result of something that over the cloth did hang between them when she struck him as having quite answered dear no for what do you take me
not the least little bit only a poor silly though quite harmless imitation what she might have passed for saying however was practically merged in what she did say for she came overtly to his aid very much as if guessing some of his thoughts
she enunciated to relieve his bewilderment the obvious truth that you couldnt leave london for three months at that time of the year and come back to find your friends just where they were as they had of course been jigging away
they might well be so red in the face that you wouldnt know them she reconciled in fine his disclaimer about milly with that honour of having discovered her which it was vain for him modestly to shirk he had unearthed her
but it was they all of them together who had developed her she was always a charmer one of the greatest ever seen but she wasnt the person he had backed
densher was to feel sure afterwards that kate had had in these pleasantries no conscious above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor susan shepherds property in their young friend which property by such remarks
was very much pushed to the wall but he was also to know that missus stringham had secretly resented them missus stringham holding the opinion of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse that all the kate croys in christendom were but dust for the feet of her milly
that it was true would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion the rare passion of friendship the sole passion of her little life save the one other more imperturbably cerebral
she slipped in the observation that her milly was incapable of change was just exactly on the contrary
she was perfectly kind to susie it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she kate had type and by being committed to admiration of type
kate had occasion subsequently she found it somehow to mention to our young man millys having spoken to her of this view on the good ladys part she would like milly had had it from her to put kate croy in a book and see what she could so do with her
chop me up fine or serve me whole it was a way of being got at that kate professed she dreaded it would be missus stringhams however she understood because missus stringham oddly felt
that with such stuff as the strange english girl was made of stuff that in spite of maud manningham who was full of sentiment she had never known there was none other to be employed these things were of later evidence
yet densher might even then have felt them in the air they were practically in it already when kate waiving the question of her friends chemical change wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now having missed so much
take them all up on trust further on he met it peacefully a little perhaps as an example to missus stringham oh as far on as you like this even had its effect missus stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself
how fearful and dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low ill look no more
shakespeare the while chalk was a bulwark between us and the foe and though one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks trying to get at us sideways they could not even see their quarry
and twas only shooting at a venture we were safe but for how short a time safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us
safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp and a shot man lying at our feet elzevir was the first to speak can you stand john is the bone broken
i cannot stand i said there is something gone in my leg and i feel blood running down into my boot he knelt and rolled down the leg of my stocking but though he only moved my foot
ever so little it caused me sharp pain for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot they have broke the leg though it bleeds little elzevir said we have no time to splice it here
but i will put a kerchief round and while i wrap it listen to how we lie and then choose what we shall do i nodded biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me and he went on
we have a quarter of an hour before the posse can get down to us but come they will and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty
and he jerked his thumb at maskew
and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air so one thing we can do is to wait here until they come and i can account for a few of them before they shoot me down but thou canst not fight with a broken leg
and they will take thee alive and then there is a dance on air at dorchester jail i felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that i was like to come so soon to such a vile end
so only gave a sigh wishing heartily that maskew were not dead and that my leg were not broke but that i was back again at the why not or even hearing one of doctor sherlocks sermons in my aunts parlour
there is yet another way that we may try and if thou hadst but two whole legs i would have tried it but now tis little short of madness and yet if thou fearst not i will still try it
just at the end of this flat ledge farthest from where the bridle path leads down but not a hundred yards from where we stand there is a sheep track leading up the cliff it starts
where the under cliff dies back again into the chalk face and climbs by slants and elbow turns up to the top the shepherds call it the zigzag and even sheep lose their footing on it and of men
i never heard but one had climbed it and that was lander jordan when the excise was on his heels half a century back but he that tries it stakes all on head and foot and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight
yet if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair i will carry thee some way and where there is no room to carry
it was a desperate chance enough but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies yes i said dear master elzevir let us get to it quickly and if we fall
tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail and with that i tried to stand thinking i might go dot and carry even with a broken leg
and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward it was a sight to stagger any man and would have made me swoon perhaps but that there was no time for we were at the end of the under cliff
and twas a task that might cow the bravest and when i looked upon the zigzag it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the posse than set foot on that awful way and fall upon the rocks below
for the zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey white cliff face
faugh said elzevir tis a poor beast has lost his foothold it was an ill omen enough and i said as much beseeching him to make his own way up the zigzag
and leave me where i was for that they might have mercy on a boy tush he cried it is thy heart that fails thee and tis too late now to change counsel
we have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with and if we gain the cliff top in that time we shall have an hours start or more for they will take all that to search the under cliff and maskew too
will keep them in check a little while they try to bring the life back to so good a man but if we fall why we shall fall together and outwit their cunning
so shut thy eyes and keep them tight until i bid thee open them with that he caught me up again and i shut my eyes firm rebuking myself for my faint heartedness and not telling him how much my foot hurt me
in a minute i knew from elzevirs steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk now i do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in england who would have ventured up that path even free and untrammelled
and not a man in all the world to do it with a full grown lad in his arms yet elzevir made no bones of it nor spoke a single word only he went very slow and i felt him scuffle with his foot
thus he went on for a time that seemed without end and yet was really but a minute or two and by degrees i felt the wind that we could scarce perceive at all on the under cliff blow fresher and cold on the cliff side
and then the path grew steeper and steeper and elzevir went slower and slower till at last he spoke john i am going to stop
but open not thy eyes till i have set thee down and bid thee i did as bidden and he lowered me gently setting me on all fours upon the path and speaking again
the path is too narrow here for me to carry thee and thou must creep round this corner on thy hands and knees but have a care to keep thy outer hand near to the inner and the balance of thy body to the cliff
for there is no room to dance hornpipes here and hold thy eyes fixed on the chalk wall looking neither down nor seaward twas well he told me what to do and well i did it
but spent much time that was so precious in travelling those ten yards to take me round the first elbow of the path for my foot was heavy and gave me fierce pain to drag though i tried to mask it from elzevir and he
forgetting what i suffered cried out quicken thy pace lad if thou canst the time is short now so frail is mans temper that though he was doing more than any ever did to save anothers life and was all i had to trust to in the world yet
but here was another difficulty for the path was still so narrow and the cliff wall so close that he could not take me up in his arms so i lay flat on my face and he stepped over me setting his foot between my shoulders to do it
and then while he knelt down upon the path
putting my arms round his neck and so he bore me pickaback i shut my eyes firm again and thus we moved along another spell mounting still and feeling the wind still freshening
both were on all fours now elzevir first and i following but as i crept along i relaxed care for a moment and my eyes wandered from the cliff side and looked down and far below
i saw the blue sea twinkling like a dazzling mirror and the gulls wheeling about the sheer chalk wall and then i thought of that bloated carcass of a sheep that had fallen from this very spot perhaps and in an instant
felt a sickening qualm and swimming of the brain and knew that i was giddy and must fall then i called out to elzevir and he guessing what had come over me cries to turn upon my side and press my belly to the cliff
and how he did it in such a narrow strait i know not but he turned round and lying down himself thrust his hand firmly in my back pressing me closer to the cliff yet it was none too soon for if he had not held me tight
i should have flung myself down in sheer despair to get quit of that dreadful sickness keep thine eyes shut john he said and count up numbers loud to me that i may know thou art not turning faint
so i gave out one two three and while i went on counting heard him repeating to himself though his words seemed thin and far off we must have taken ten minutes to get here
and in five more they will be on the under cliff and if we ever reach the top who knows but they have left a guard no no they will not leave a guard for not a man knows of the zigzag and if they knew
like sitting guillemots against the cliff face so he talked to himself and all the while i would have given a world to pluck up heart and creep on farther yet could not for the deadly sweating fear that had hold of me
thus i lay with my face to the cliff and elzevir pushing firmly in my back and the thing that frightened me most was that there was nothing at all for the hand to take hold of for had there been a piece of string or even a thread of cotton
i think i could have done it but there was only the cliff wall sheer and white against that narrowest way with never cranny to put a finger into the wind was blowing in fresh puffs and though i did not open my eyes
i knew that it was moving the little tufts of bent grass and the chiding cries of the gulls seemed to invite me to be done with fear and pain and broken leg and fling myself off on to the rocks below then elzevir spoke john he said
there is no time to play the woman another minute of this and we are lost pluck up thy courage keep thy eyes to the cliff and forward yet i could not but answered i cannot i cannot
move thou must and tis better to risk falling now than fall for certain with another bullet in thee later on and with that he shifted his hand from my back and fixed it in my coat collar moving backwards himself and setting to drag me after him
now i was so besotted with fright that i would not budge an inch fearing to fall over if i opened my eyes and elzevir for all he was so strong could not pull a helpless lump backwards up that path
so he gave it up leaving go hold on me with a groan and at that moment there rose from the under cliff below a sound of voices and shouting zounds they are down already cried elzevir and have found maskews body
it is all up another minute and they will see us but so strange is the force of mind on body and the power of a greater to master a lesser fear that when i heard those voices from below all fright of falling left me in a moment
and i could open my eyes without a trace of giddiness so i began to move forward again on hands and knees and elzevir
thinking that we were hiding by the sea five minutes later elzevir stepped on to the cliff top with me upon his back we have made something of this throw he said and are safe for another hour though i thought thy giddy head had ruined us
the day was still young and far below us was stretched the moving floor of the channel with a silver grey film of night mists not yet lifted in the offing a hummocky up and down line of cliffs
with the straight sunpath across it spangled and gleaming like a mackerels back the relief of being once more on firm ground and the exultation of an escape from immediate danger removed my pain and made me forget that my leg was broken
and the wind which a few minutes before threatened to blow me from that narrow ledge seemed now but the gentlest of breezes fresh with the breath of the kindly sea but this was only for a moment for the anguish came back and grew apace
and i fell to thinking dismally of the plight we were in how things had been against us in these last days first there was losing the why not and that was bad enough second
there was the being known by the excise for smugglers and perhaps for murderers third and last there was the breaking of my leg which made escape so difficult but most of all
there came before my eyes that grey face turned up against the morning sun and i thought of all it meant for grace and would have given my own life to call back that of our worst enemy then elzevir sat up stretching himself like one waking out of sleep
and said we must be gone they will not be back for some time yet and when they come will not think to search closely for us hereabouts but that we cannot risk and must get clear away
this leg of thine will keep us tied for weeks and we must find some place where we can lie hid and tend it now i know such a hiding hole in purbeck which they call josephs pit and thither we must go but it will take all the day to get there
and so he took me in his arms again and started off across the fields i need not tell of that weary journey and indeed could not if i wished for the pain went to my head and filled me with such a drowsy anguish
that i knew nothing except when some unlooked for movement gave me a sharper twinge and made me cry out at first elzevir walked briskly but as the day wore on went slower
it was after noon for the sun was past the meridian and very hot for the time of year when the face of the country began to change and instead of the short sward of the open down sprinkled with tiny white snail shells
the ground was brashy with flat stones and divided up into tillage fields it was a bleak wide bitten place enough looking as if twould never pay for turning and instead of hedges there were dreary walls built of dry stone without mortar
behind one of these walls broken down in places but held together with straggling ivy and buttressed here and there with a bramble bush elzevir put me down at length and said i am beat and can carry thee no farther for this present
though there is not now much farther to go we have passed purbeck gates and these walls will screen us from prying eyes if any chance comer pass along the down and as for the soldiers they are not like to come this way so soon
and if they come i cannot help it for weariness and the suns heat have made my feet like lead a score of years ago i would have laughed at such a task but now tis different
so sit thee here and lean thy shoulder up against the wall and thus thou canst look through this broken place and watch both ways then if thou see aught moving wake me up
i wish i had a thimbleful of powder to make this whistle sound and he took maskews silver butted pistol again from his bosom and handled it lovingly
with that he flung himself down where there was a narrow shadow close against the bottom of the wall and in a minute i knew from his heavy breathing that he was asleep the wind had freshened much and was blowing strong from the west
and now that i was under the lee of the wall
and gets at length into shelter moreover though i was not tired by grievous toil like elzevir i had passed a night without sleep and felt besides the weariness of pain to lull me to slumber
then i sought something to fix my thoughts and looking on that side of the wall where the sward was fell to counting the mole hills that were cast up in numbers thereabout and when i had exhausted them and reckoned up thirty little heaps of dry and powdery brown earth
that lay at random on the green turf i turned my eyes to the tillage field on the other side of the wall and saw the inch high blades of corn coming up between the stones then i fell to counting the blades feeling glad to have discovered a reckoning that would not be exhausted at thirty
but would go on for millions and millions and millions and before i had reached ten in so heroic a numeration was fast asleep a sharp noise woke me with a start that set the pain tingling in my leg
and though i could see nothing i knew that a shot had been fired very near us i was for waking elzevir but he was already full awake and put a finger on his lip to show i should not speak then
enough for him to look through the leaves without being seen he dropped down again with a look of relief and said tis but a lad scaring rooks with a blunderbuss we will not stir unless he makes this way a minute later he said the boy is coming straight for the wall
we shall have to show ourselves and while he spoke there was a rattle of falling stones where the boy was partly climbing and partly pulling down the dry wall and so elzevir stood up the boy looked frightened and made as if he would run off
but elzevir passed him the time of day in a civil voice and he stopped and gave it back what are you doing here son block asked scaring rooks for farmer topp was the answer
have you got a charge of powder to spare said elzevir showing his pistol i want to get a rabbit in the gorse for supper and have dropped my flask maybe youve seen a flask in walking through the furrows he whispered to me to lie still
no time was wasted in words elzevir had the flask in his pocket and the boy was biting the crown what shot have you said elzevir what have you dropped your shot flask too asked the boy
and his voice had something of surprise in it nay but my shot are over small
but thou must pay a shilling for them my master says i never am to use them except i see a swan or buzzard or something fit to cook come over i shall get a sound beating for my pains and to be beat is worth a shilling if thou art beat be beat for something more says elzevir the tempter
the smugglers got off clear but they say the hue and cry is up already and that a head price will be fixed of twenty pound so if i sell you a fowling piece maybe i shall do wrong and have the government upon me as well as my master the surprise in his voice was changed to suspicion
for while he spoke i saw that his eye had fallen on my foot though i tried to keep it in the shadow and that he saw the boot clotted with blood and the kerchief tied round my leg tis for that very reason says elzevir that i want the firelock
these smugglers are roaming loose and a pistol is a poor thing to stop such wicked rascals on a lone hill side come come thou dost not want a piece to guard thee they will not hurt a boy he had the guinea between his finger and thumb
and so i said as much to elzevir who only laughed saying the boy was simple and harmless but from where i sat i could peep out through the brambles in the open gap and see without being seen and there was my young gentleman walking carelessly enough
but when elzevir sat down the boy gave a careful look round and seeing no one watching any more
then i knew that he had guessed who we were and was off to warn the hue and cry but before elzevir was on his feet again the boy was out of sight over the hill brow let us move on said block tis but a little distance now to go and the heat is past already
we must have slept three hours or more for thou art but a sorry watchman john tis when the sentry sleeps that the enemy laughs and for thee the posse might have had us both like daylight owls with that he took me on his back and made off with a lusty stride
and in the shelter of the walls we had slept longer than we thought for the sun was westering fast and though the rest had refreshed me my leg had grown stiff and hurt the more in dangling when we started again
elzevir was still walking strongly in spite of the heavy burden he carried and in less than half an hour i knew though i had never been there before we were in the land of the old marble quarries at the back of anvil point
although i knew little of these quarries and certainly was in evil plight to take note of anything at that time yet afterwards i learnt much about them out of such excavations comes that black purbeck marble which you see in old churches in our country
and i am told in other parts of england as well and the way of making a marble quarry is to sink a tunnel slanting very steeply down into the earth like a well turned askew till you reach fifty seventy or perhaps one hundred feet deep then
from the bottom of this shaft there spread out narrow passages or tunnels mostly six feet high but sometimes only three or four and in these the marble is dug these quarries were made by men centuries ago some say by the romans themselves
which was just putting on the brighter green of spring this turf was not smooth but hummocky for under it lay heaps of worthless stone and marble drawn out of the quarries ages ago which the green vestment had covered for the most part
though it left sometimes a little patch of broken rubble peering out at the top of a mound there were many tumble down walls and low gables left of the cottages of the old quarrymen grass covered ridges marked out the little garden folds
and here and there still stood a forlorn gooseberry bush
on which the marble blocks were once hauled up by wooden winches down these steps no feet ever walked now for not only were suffocating gases said to beset the bottom of the shafts
for if it were not for this holy purpose the mandrive would have power to strangle the man that hewed it it was by the side of one of these old shafts that elzevir laid me down at last the light was very low
and the sward crept over the edges of the hole and every crack and crevice in steps and slide was green with ferns the green ferns shrouded the walls of the hole and ruddy brown brambles overgrew the steps
there he said this is josephs pit and here we must lie hid until thy foot is sound again once get to the bottom safe and we can laugh at posse and hue and cry
and before they come to where we lie we can hold the troop at bay and sell our lives so dear they will not care to buy them we waited a few minutes and then he took me in his arms and began to descend the steps back first as one goes down a hatchway
and how far off we were now and how long it was likely to be before i saw that dear village and grace again the stairs were still sharp cut and little worn but elzevir paid great care to his feet lest he should slip on the ferns and mosses with which they were overgrown
he shoved them aside with his broad shoulders and screened my dangling leg from getting caught thus he came safe without stumble to the bottom of the pit when we got there all was dark but he stepped off into a narrow opening on the right hand
and walked on as if he knew the way i could see nothing but perceived that we were passing through endless galleries cut in the solid rock high enough for the most part to allow of walking upright but sometimes so low as to force him to bend down
and carry me in a very constrained attitude only twice did he set me down at a turning while he took out his tinder box and lit a match
poor mortals who wait for a happy day cheer up your hearts
if it be lawful firmly to believe
though it be at hand yea and before there shall appear a race of men who loth to sit still in one place shall boldly go before all peoples eyes suborning men of divers qualities to draw them
and children their own parents in a word all reverence shall then be banished no true respect to other shall be had theyll say that every man should have his turn both in his going forth and his return
such woes such jarrings
that never were in history such coils set down as yet such tumults and garboils
who trusting too much in their hopeful time live but a while and perish in their prime neither shall any who this course shall run leave off the race which he hath once begun
the veriest lout of all shall be their judge o horrible and dangerous deluge deluge i call it and that for good reason for this shall be omitted in no season
because they did not spare the flocks of beasts that innocentest are but did their sinews and their bowels take not to the gods a sacrifice to make but usually to serve themselves for sport
and now consider i do you exhort in such commotions so continual what rest can take the globe terrestrial most happy then are they that can it hold and use it carefully as precious gold
by keeping it in gaol whence it shall have no help but him who being to it gave and to increase his mournful accident
shall cease to dart upon it any light more than in an eclipse or in the night so that at once its favour shall be gone and liberty with it be left alone and yet before it come to ruin thus
inarime did not more quickly move when typheus did the vast huge hills remove and for despite into the sea them threw thus shall it then be lost by ways not few
and yet before that they be clean disperst
o he is worthy praise that shrinketh not no sooner was this enigmatical monument read over but gargantua fetching a very deep sigh said unto those that stood by
are persecuted but happy is that man that shall not be scandalized but shall always continue to the end in aiming at that mark which god by his dear son hath set before us
without being distracted or diverted by his carnal affections and depraved nature the monk then said what do you think in your conscience is meant and signified by this riddle what
said gargantua the progress and carrying on of the divine truth by saint goderan said the monk that is not my exposition it is the style of the prophet merlin
make upon it as many grave allegories and glosses as you will and dote upon it you and the rest of the world as long as you please for my part
in dark and obscure terms the suborners of men are the makers of matches which are commonly friends after the two chases are made he that was in the upper end of the tennis court goeth out
and the other cometh in they believe the first that saith the ball was over or under the line the waters are the heats that the players take till they sweat again the cords of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats
the globe terrestrial is the tennis ball after playing when the game is done they refresh themselves before a clear fire and change their shirts and very willingly they make all good cheer
the yosemite or grizzly bear tribe fancying themselves secure in their deep mountain stronghold were the most troublesome and defiant of all and it was while the mariposa battalion under command of major savage
was trying to capture this warlike tribe and conduct them to the fresno reservation that their deep mountain home the yosemite valley was discovered
instructing them to tell the indians that if they would come in and make treaty with the commissioners they would be furnished with food and clothing and be protected but if they did not come in he would make war upon them and kill them all
informed him of the wishes of the commissioners but the old chief was very suspicious of savage and feared that he was taking this method of getting the tribe into his power for the purpose of revenging his personal wrong
tenaya inquired what was the object of taking all the indians to the san joaquin plain my people
my young men have sometimes taken horses and mules from the whites
my young men believed that the gold diggers were our enemies
and we shall be glad to live in peace with them we will stay here and be friends my people do not want to go to the plains some of the tribes who have gone there are very bad we cannot live with them here we can defend ourselves
to the major savage firmly said your people must go to the commissioners if they do not your young men will again steal horses and kill and plunder the whites
it was your people who robbed my stores burned my houses and murdered my men it they do not make a treaty your whole tribe will be destroyed not one of them will be left alive to this the old chief replied
it is useless to talk to you about who destroyed your property and killed your people i am old and you can kill me if you will but it is useless to lie to you who know more than all the indians
therefore i will not lie to you but if you will let me return to my people i will bring them in he was allowed to go the next day he came back
and said his people were on the way to our camp to go with the men sent by the great father who was so good and rich another day passed but no indians from the deep valley appeared
after waiting still another day the expedition started for the valley when tenaya was questioned as to the route and distance he said that the snow was so deep that the horses could not go through it
savage told tenaya that he was not telling the truth for indians could not cross the mountains in the deep snow and that he knew they must still be at his village or hiding somewhere near it
to see your people who will not come they will come if i find them you will not find any of my people there said tenaya i do not know where they are my tribe is small
many of the people of my tribe have come from other tribes and if they go to the plains and are seen they will be killed by the friends of those with whom they have quarreled i was told that i was growing old and it was well that i should go
but that young and strong men can find plenty in the mountains therefore why should they go to the hot plains to be penned up like horses and cattle my heart has been sore since that talk
but i am now willing to go for it is best for my people pushing ahead taking turns in breaking a way through the snow they arrived in sight of the great valley early in the afternoon
and guided by one of tenayas indians descended by the same route as that followed by the mariposa trail and the weary party went into camp on the river bank opposite el capitan after supper seated around a big fire
pohono the bridal veil being the principal one the expedition remained only one day and two nights in the valley hurrying out on the approach of a storm and reached the south fork headquarters
on the evening of the third day after starting out
most of it had been explored in a general way and some of its principal features had been named but the indians had fled up the tenaya canyon trail and none of them were seen except an old woman unable to follow the fugitives
a second expedition was made in the same year under command of major boling when the valley was entered no indians were seen but the many wigwams with smoldering fires
showed that they had been hurriedly abandoned that very day later five young indians who had been left to watch the movements of the expedition were captured at the foot of the three brothers after a lively chase
that same day the old chief was captured on the cliff on the east side of indian canyon by some of bolings scouts as tenaya walked toward the camp his eye fell upon the dead body of his favorite son captain boling
through an interpreter expressed his regret at the occurrence but not a word did tenaya utter in reply later
but was caught as he was about to swim across the river
and when brought into the presence of captain boling he said in great emotion kill me sir captain yes kill me as you killed my son as you would kill my people if they were to come to you
but wait a little and when i am dead i will call my people to come and they shall hear me in their sleep and come to avenge the death of their chief and his son yes sir america my spirit will make trouble for you and your people
this led to another yosemite expedition a detachment of regular soldiers from fort miller under lieutenant moore u s a was at once dispatched to capture or punish the murderers
when the captives were accused of the murder of the two white men they admitted that they had killed them to prevent white men from coming to their valley declaring that it was their home and that white men had no right to come there without their consent
to this they replied that tenaya had never consented to the sale of their valley and had never received pay for it the other chief they said had no right to sell their territory
the lieutenant being fully satisfied that he had captured the real murderers promptly pronounced judgment and had them placed in line and shot lieutenant moore pursued the fugitives to mono but was not successful in finding any of them
they stole a number of stolen horses from their entertainers and made their way by a long obscure route by the head of the north fork of the san joaquin
but early one morning after a feast of horse flesh a band of monos surprised them in their huts killing tenaya and nearly all his tribe only a small remnant escaped down the river canyon
when mister j m hutchings having heard of its wonderful scenery collected a party and made the first regular tourists visit to the yosemite
described it in articles illustrated by a good artist who was taken into the valley by him for that purpose
consisting of sixteen or eighteen persons the next year the regular pleasure travel began and a trail on the mariposa side of the valley was opened by mann brothers this trail was afterwards purchased by the citizens of the county
the first house built in the yosemite valley was erected in the autumn of eighteen fifty six and was kept as a hotel the next year by g a hite and later by j h neal and s m cunningham
by mister hutchings all these hotels have vanished except the frame house built in eighteen fifty nine which has been changed beyond recognition a large hotel built on the brink of the river in front of the old one
after the establishment by act of congress in eighteen ninety of the yosemite national park and the recession in nineteen o five of the original reservation to the federal government by the state

almost as soon as he was discoverable let us spare a moment and a tear for those golden days in the early nineteen hundreds when there were five leisurely papers of an evening
in which the free lance might graduate and he could speak of his alma mater whether the globe or the pall mall with as much pride as he never doubted the globe or the pall mall would speak one day of him
myself but lately down from saint james i was not too proud to take some slight but pitying interest in men of other colleges the unusual name of a freshman up at westminster attracted my attention
later one heard that this undergraduate from overseas had gone up at an age more advanced than customary
so one felt that this westminster free lance in the thirties was no fit competitor for the youth of other colleges indeed it could not compete well i discovered him
which made me thus ungenerous of his name or it may have been the feeling that the others were not worthy of him but how refreshing it was when some intellectually blown up stranger said do you ever read saki
to us many others who were trying to do it too for we were so domestic he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan while we were being funny as planned with collar studs and hot water bottles
if sakis careless cruelty that strange boyish insensitiveness of his did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter it may have been so but fortunately
our efforts to be funny in the saki manner have not survived to prove it what is sakis manner
like every artist worth consideration he had no recipe if his exotic choice of subject was often his strength it was often his weakness
if his insensitiveness carried him through at times to victory it brought him at times to defeat i do not think that he has that mastery of the conte in this book at least
which some have claimed for him
which was not in the boyish sakis equipment he leaves loose ends everywhere nor in his dialogue delightful as it often is funny as it nearly always is is he the supreme master
too much does it become monologue judiciously fed one character giving and the other taking but in comment in reference in description in every development of his story
he has a choice of words a way of putting things which is as inevitably his own vintage as once tasted it becomes the private vintage of the connoisseur
let us take a sample or two of saki nineteen eleven the earlier stages of the dinner had worn off the wine lists had been consulted
locate is the pleasant word here still more satisfying in the story of the man who was tattooed from collar bone to waist line with a glowing representation of the fall of icarus
is the word privilege the design when finally developed was a slight disappointment to monsieur deplis who had suspected icarus of being a fortress
but he was more than satisfied with the execution of the work which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as pincinis masterpiece this story the background

who had been apprentice to the shoemaker aliakhin for three months did not go to bed the night before christmas
had gone out to an early church service to procure from his employers cupboard
then spreading a crumpled sheet of paper in front of him he began to write before however deciding to make the first letter he looked furtively at the door and at the window glanced several times at the sombre ikon
he wrote i am writing you a letter
and vividly pictured to himself his grandfather
always smiling and blear eyed all day he slept in the servants kitchen or trifled with the cooks
how to sneak up and take a bite at a leg or slip into the larder
more than once they had nearly broken his hind legs twice he had been hung up every week he was nearly flogged to death but he always recovered at this moment for certain
his cudgel will be hanging from his belt he will be hugging himself with cold giving a little dry old mans cough and at times pinching a servant girl or a cook wont we take some snuff
he asks holding out his snuff box to the women the women take a pinch of snuff and sneeze the old man goes into indescribable ecstasies breaks into loud laughter and cries
not a breath of wind clear and frosty
that it looks as if it had been polished and rubbed over with snow for the holidays vanka sighs dips his pen in the ink and continues to write last night i got a thrashing
my master dragged me by my hair into the yard and belaboured me with a shoe makers stirrup because
i unfortunately fell asleep and during the week my mistress told me to clean a herring
so she took the herring and stuck its snout into my face the assistants tease me send me to the tavern for vodka make me steal the masters cucumbers and the master beats me with whatever is handy
food there is none in the morning its bread at dinner gruel and in the evening bread again as for tea or sour cabbage soup the master and the mistress themselves guzzle that
they make me sleep in the vestibule and when their brat cries i dont sleep at all but have to rock the cradle dear grandpapa for heavens sake take me away from here
home to our village i cant bear this any more i bow to the ground to you and will pray to god for ever and ever take me from here or i shall die
the corners of vankas mouth went down he rubbed his eyes with his dirty fist and sobbed ill grate your tobacco for you he continued ill pray to god for you
and if there is anything wrong then flog me like the grey goat and if you really think i shant find work
for christs sake to let me clean the boots or ill go instead of fedya as underherdsman dear grandpapa i cant bear this any more itll kill me i wanted to run away to our village
but i have no boots and i was afraid of the frost and when i grow up ill look after you
the children dont come round at christmas with a star no one is allowed to sing in the choir
all for sale and for every kind of fish awfully convenient and there was one hook which would catch a sheat fish weighing a pound and there are shops with guns like the masters and i am sure they must cost one hundred rubles each
take a golden walnut and hide it in my green box ask the young lady olga ignatyevna for it say its for vanka vanka sighed convulsively and again stared at the window
he remembered that his grandfather always went to the forest for the christmas tree and took his grandson with him what happy times the frost crackled his grandfather crackled and as they both did
vanka did the same then before cutting down the christmas tree his grandfather smoked his pipe took a long pinch of snuff and made fun of poor frozen little vanka
the young fir trees wrapt in hoar frost stood motionless waiting for which of them would die suddenly a hare springing from somewhere would dart over the snowdrift his grandfather could not help shouting catch it catch it
short tailed devil when the tree was down his grandfather dragged it to the masters house and there they set about decorating it the young lady olga ignatyevna vankas great friend
busied herself most about it when little vankas mother pelagueya was still alive and was servant woman in the house olga ignatyevna used to stuff him with sugar candy and having nothing to do
taught him to read write count up to one hundred and even to dance the quadrille when pelagueya died they placed the orphan vanka in the kitchen with his grandfather and from the kitchen he was sent to moscow
and i am frightfully hungry and so sad that i cant tell you i cry all the time the other day the master hit me on the head with a last i fell to the ground and only just returned to life
my life is a misfortune worse than any dogs i send greetings to aliona to one eyed tegor and the coachman and dont let any one have my mouth organ i remain your grandson
from whom he had inquired the night before had told him that letters were to be put into post boxes and from there they were conveyed over the whole earth in mail troikas by drunken post boys
and to the sound of bells vanka ran to the first post box and slipped his precious letter into the slit an hour afterwards lulled by hope he was sleeping soundly
in sixteen sixty five written by a citizen who continued all the while in london never made public before
it was about the beginning of september sixteen sixty four that i among the rest of my neighbours heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in holland
it was brought some said from italy others from the levant among some goods which were brought home by their turkey fleet others said it was brought from candia others from cyprus
spread rumours and reports of things and to improve them by the invention of men as i have lived to see practised since
and from them was handed about by word of mouth only so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation as they do now but it seems that the government had a true account of it
and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over but all was kept very private hence it was that this rumour died off again and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in
and that we hoped was not true till the latter end of november or the beginning of december sixteen sixty four when two men said to be frenchmen died of the plague in long acre
or rather at the upper end of drury lane
endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood the secretaries of state got knowledge of it and concerning themselves to inquire about it in order to be certain of the truth
two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection this they did and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead
and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner thus plague two parishes infected one
but after that i think it was about the twelfth of february another died in another house but in the same parish and in the same manner this turned the peoples eyes pretty much towards that end of the town
it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town and that many had died of it though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible
this possessed the heads of the people very much and few cared to go through drury lane or the other streets suspected unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it
the usual number of burials in a week in the parishes of saint giles in the fields and saint andrews holborn were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each few more or less
it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably for example from december twenty seventh to january third
the like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of saint brides adjoining on one side of holborn parish and in the parish of saint james clerkenwell adjoining on the other side of holborn
saint brides zero saint jamess eight
saint brides six saint jamess nine
saint jamess seven
saint brides eight
saint jamess six besides this it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks although it was at a time of the year when
in one week since the preceding visitation of sixteen fifty six however all this went off again and the weather proving cold and the frost which began in december
still continuing very severe even till near the end of february attended with sharp though moderate winds the bills decreased again and the city grew healthy and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over
from the beginning of april especially they stood at twenty five each week till the week from the eighteenth to the twenty fifth
there was none of the plague and but four of the spotted fever but the following week it returned again and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes
not knowing that he was already infected this was the beginning of may yet the weather was temperate variable and cool enough and people had still some hopes that which encouraged them was that the city was healthy
there died but three of which not one within the whole city or liberties and saint andrews buried but fifteen which was very low
but still as there was but one of the plague people began to be easy the whole bill also was very low for the week before the bill was but three hundred forty seven
so that now all our extenuations abated and it was no more to be concealed nay it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement that in the parish of saint giles
but this was all knavery and collusion
yet there was fourteen of the spotted fever as well as fourteen of the plague
upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague the next bill was from the twenty third of may to the thirtieth when the number of the plague was seventeen but
a frightful number of whom they set down but nine of the plague but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace and at the lord mayors request
twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish but had been set down of the spotted fever or other distempers besides others concealed
our neighbourhood continued very easy but at the other end of the town their consternation was very great and the richer sort of people especially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city
in an unusual manner and this was more particularly seen in whitechappel that is to say the broad street where i lived indeed nothing was to be seen but waggons and carts with goods
coaches filled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them and all hurrying away then empty waggons and carts appeared and spare horses with servants who it was apparent
were returning or sent from the countries to fetch more people besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback some alone others with servants and generally speaking
as anyone might perceive by their appearance this was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see and as it was a sight which i could not but look on from morning to night
this hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no getting at the lord mayors door without exceeding difficulty there were such pressing and crowding there
to get passes and certificates of health for such as travelled abroad for without these there was no being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road or to lodge in any inn
now as there had none died in the city for all this time my lord mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety seven parishes and to those within the liberties too
this hurry i say continued some weeks that is to say all the month of may and june and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the government was to be issued out
to place turnpikes and barriers on the road to prevent people travelling and that the towns on the road would not suffer people from london to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with them
concerning my own case and how i should dispose of myself that is to say whether i should resolve to stay in london or shut up my house and flee as many of my neighbours did i have set this particular down
so fully because i know not but it may be of moment to those who come after me if they come to be brought to the same distress and to the same manner of making their choice and therefore
to note what became of me i had two important things before me
which was considerable and in which was embarked all my effects in the world and the other was the preservation of my life in so dismal a calamity as i saw apparently was coming upon the whole city and which
however great it was my fears perhaps as well as other peoples represented to be much greater than it could be
my trade was a saddler and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade but among the merchants trading to the english colonies in america so my effects lay very much in the hands of such
but i had a family of servants whom i kept at my business had a house shop and warehouses filled with goods and in short to leave them all as things in such a case must be left that is to say
without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them had been to hazard the loss not only of my trade but of my goods and indeed of all i had in the world i had an elder brother
at the same time in london and not many years before come over from portugal and advising with him his answer was in three words
that the best preparation for the plague was to run away from it as to my argument of losing my trade my goods or debts he quite confuted me he told me the same thing which
for says he is it not as reasonable that you should trust god with the chance or risk of losing your trade as that you should stay in so eminent a point of danger and trust him with your life i could not
i say as many did because several did so at last especially those who had been in the armies in the war which had not been many years past and i must needs say that speaking of second causes
had most of the people that travelled done so the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and houses as it was to the great damage and indeed to the ruin of abundance of people
but then my servant whom i had intended to take down with me deceived me and being frighted at the increase of the distemper and not knowing when i should go he took other measures and left me
so i was put off for that time and one way or other i always found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by some accident or other so as to disappoint and put it off again
about these disappointments being from heaven i mention this story also as the best method i can advise any person to take in such a case especially if he be one that makes conscience of his duty
and would be directed what to do in it namely that he should keep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time and look upon them complexly as they regard one another
and as all together regard the question before him and then i think he may safely take them for intimations from heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case i mean
so these disappointments must have something in them extraordinary and i ought to consider whether it did not evidently point out or intimate to me that it was the will of heaven i should not go
that would surround me and that if i attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my habitation and acted contrary to these intimations which i believe to be divine it was a kind of
flying from god and that he could cause his justice to overtake me when and where he thought fit these thoughts quite turned my resolutions again and when i came to discourse with my brother again
i told him that i inclined to stay and take my lot in that station in which god had placed me and that it seemed to be made more especially my duty on the account of what i have said
my brother though a very religious man himself laughed at all i had suggested about its being an intimation from heaven and told me several stories of such foolhardy people as he called them
as i was that i ought indeed to submit to it as a work of heaven if i had been any way disabled by distempers or diseases and that then not being able to go
i ought to acquiesce in the direction of him who having been my maker had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me and that then there had been
only because i could not hire a horse to go or my fellow was run away that was to attend me was ridiculous since at the time i had my health and limbs and other servants and might
and in other places where he had been for my brother being a merchant was a few years before as i have already observed returned from abroad coming last from lisbon and how
they would go unconcerned into infected places and converse with infected persons by which means they died at the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week
whereas the europeans or christian merchants who kept themselves retired and reserved generally escaped the contagion upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again
and i began to resolve to go and accordingly made all things ready for in short the infection increased round me
and as i had already prepared everything as well as i could as to my business and whom to entrust my affairs with i had little to do but to resolve i went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind
irresolute and not knowing what to do i had set the evening wholly apart to consider seriously about it and was all alone for already people had as it were by a general consent
what was my duty to do and i stated the arguments with which my brother had pressed me to go into the country and i set against them the strong impressions which i had on my mind for staying the visible call i seemed to have
from the particular circumstance of my calling and the care due from me for the preservation of my effects which were as i might say my estate also the intimations which i thought
i obeyed this lay close to me and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to stay than ever and supported with a secret satisfaction that i should be kept add to this that
and at that juncture i happened to stop turning over the book
i read on to the seventh verse exclusive and after that included the tenth as follows i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god
in him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust
because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
he was as able to keep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health and if he did not think fit to deliver me still i was in his hands
and it was meet he should do with me as should seem good to him with this resolution i went to bed
the woman being taken ill with whom i had intended to entrust my house and all my affairs
and afterwards fetched a round farther into buckinghamshire or bedfordshire to a retreat he had found out there for his family it was a very ill time to be sick in
for if any one complained it was immediately said he had the plague
yet being very ill both in my head and in my stomach i was not without apprehension that i really was infected but in about three days i grew better the third night i rested well
sweated a little and was much refreshed the apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my illness and i went about my business as usual
it was now mid july and the plague which had chiefly raged at the other end of the town and as i said before in the parishes of saint giles saint andrews holborn
for the city that is to say within the walls was indifferently healthy still nor was it got then very much over the water into southwark
of all distempers whereof it might be supposed above six hundred died of the plague yet there was but twenty eight in the whole city within the walls and but nineteen in southwark
but we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out parishes which being very populous and fuller also of poor the distemper found more to prey upon than in the city
yet there died no more of the plague on the whole southwark side of the water than sixteen but this face of things soon changed
and it began to thicken in cripplegate parish especially and in clarkenwell so that by the second week in august cripplegate parish alone buried eight hundred eighty six and clarkenwell
and of the last the bill itself said
and having the key in my pocket i used to go into the house and over most of the rooms to see that all was well for though it be something wonderful to tell
that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal yet certain it is that all sorts of villainies and even levities and debaucheries
were then practised in the town as openly as ever i will not say quite as frequently because the numbers of people were many ways lessened but the city itself began now to be visited too
magistrates and servants left in the city as they fled now out of the city so i should observe that the court removed early
in the month of june and went to oxford where it pleased god to preserve them and the distemper did not as i heard of so much as touch them for which i cannot say that
and hardly anything of reformation though they did not want being told that their crying vices might without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing that terrible judgement upon the whole nation
that if i had been a stranger and at a loss for my way i might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street i mean of the by streets and seen nobody to direct me
but they walked in the middle of the great street neither on one side
because as i suppose they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses or
as others retired really frighted with the distemper it was a mere desolating of some of the streets but the fright was not yet near so great in the city abstractly so called
and particularly because though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation yet as i have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first so they were as it were
a little hardened it is true a vast many people fled as i have observed yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town and from that we call the heart of the city that is to say
among the wealthiest of the people and such people as were unencumbered with trades and business but of the rest the generality stayed and seemed to abide the worst so that
and in the suburbs in southwark and in the east part such as wapping ratcliff stepney rotherhithe and the like the people generally stayed except here and there a few wealthy families who as above
and the royal family and the monarchy being restored had flocked to london to settle in business or to depend upon and attend the court for rewards of services preferments and the like
was such that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand people more than ever it held before nay some took upon them to say it had twice as many because
all the ruined families of the royal party flocked hither all the old soldiers set up trades here and abundance of families settled here again
to london i often thought that as jerusalem was besieged by the romans when the jews were assembled together to celebrate the passover by which means an incredible number of people were surprised there
as this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay court made a great trade in the city especially in everything that belonged to fashion and finery
manufacturers and the like
orphans keseberg and his accusers sensational accounts of the tragedy at donner lake property sold and guardian appointed kindly indians grandpa
the report of our affliction spread rapidly and the well meaning tender hearted women at the fort came to condole and weep with us and made their children weep also by urging
now do say something comforting to these poor little girls who were frozen and starved up in the mountains and are now orphans in a strange land without any home or any one to care for them such ordeals were too overwhelming
i would rush off alone among the wild flowers to get away from the torturing sympathy even there i met those who would look at me with great serious eyes shake their heads and mournfully say you poor little mite
how much better it would be if you had died in the mountains with your dear mother instead of being left alone to struggle in this wicked world this would but increase my distress for i did not want to be dead and buried up there under the cold deep snow
and i knew that mother did not want me to be there either had she not sent me away to save me and asked god our heavenly father to take care of me
intense excitement and indignation prevailed at the fort after captain fallon and other members of his party gave their account of the conditions found at the mountain camps and of interviews had with keseberg whom they now called cannibal
robber and murderer the wretched man was accused by this party not only of having needlessly partaken of human flesh and of having appropriated coin and other property which should have come to us orphaned children
but also of having wantonly taken the life of missus murphy and of my mother some declared him crazy others called him a monster keseberg denied these charges and
he stated that missus murphy had died of starvation soon after the departure of the third relief and that my mother had watched by fathers bedside until he died
after preparing his body for burial she had started out on the trail to go to her children in attempting to cross the distance from her camp to his she had strayed and wandered about far into the night
and finally reached his cabin wet shivering and grief stricken yet determined to push onward she had brought nothing with her but told him where to find money to take to her children in the event of her not reaching them
he stated that he offered her food which she refused he then attempted to persuade her to wait until morning and while they were talking she sank upon the floor completely exhausted and he covered her with blankets and made a fire to warm her
in the morning he found her cold in death
saved him from personal violence but not from suspicion and ill will women shunned him and children stoned him as he walked about the fort the california star printed in full the account of the fallon party
and blood curdling editorials increased public sentiment against keseberg stamping him with the mark of cain and closing the door of every home against him
also of what was said about the alleged murder of our mother still we did hear fragments of conversations which greatly disturbed us and our sisters found it difficult to answer some of our questions meanwhile
more disappointments for us were brewing at the fort fallons party demanded an immediate settlement of its claim it had gone up the mountains under promise that its members should have not only a per diem as rescuers
taken from concealment on kesebergs person and two hundred and seventy five dollars additional taken from a cache that keseberg had disclosed after the captain had partially strangled him
should be handed over to captain fallon to satisfy the claims of his party and the other half should be put into the hands of a guardian
notwithstanding these plans for our well being unaccountable delays followed making our situation daily more trying
they had not fully recovered from the effects of their long privations and physical sufferings in the mountains and the loss of parents and means of support placed upon them responsibilities greater than they could carry
no matter how bravely they strove to meet the situation how can we provide for ourselves and these little sisters was a question which haunted them by night and perplexed them by day
they had no way of communicating with our friends in eastern states and the women at the fort could ill afford to provide longer for us since their bread winners were still with fremont and their own supplies were limited
finally my two eldest sisters were given employment by different families in exchange for food which they shared with us but it was often insufficient and we little ones drifted along forlornly sometimes home
was where night overtook us often we trudged to the rancheria beyond the pond made by the adobe moulders who had built the houses and wall surrounding the fort there the indian mothers were good to us
we three were playing near it when a joyous indian girl with a bundle of clothes on her head ran down the bank to the waters edge we following
merrily up and down in the clear water she lathered them with a freshly gathered soap root and cleansed them according to the ways of the spanish mission teachers as she tied the wet garments in a bundle and turned to carry them to the drying ground frances
floating near the end of the board and lay down upon it for the purpose of catching them
saw the poppies drift just beyond her finger tips saw her lean a little farther then slip head first into the deep water such shrieks as terrified children give brought the indian girl quickly to our aid like a flash
she tossed the bundle from her head sprang into the water snatched frances as she rose to the surface and restored her to us without a word before we had recovered sufficiently to speak she was gone
not a soul was in sight when we started toward the fort all unconscious of what the inevitable is to be was weaving into our lives
we were too young to keep track of time by calendar but counted it by happenings some were marked with tears some with smiles and some stole unawares upon us just as on that bright june evening
when we did not find our sisters and aimlessly followed others to the little shop where a friendly appearing elderly man was cutting slices of meat and handing them to customers
we did not know his name nor did we realize that he was selling the meat he handed out only that we wanted some so after all the others had gone we addressed him asking grandpa please give us a little piece of meat
and said that we should sleep at her house that night and see our sisters in the morning she also gave us permission to cook our pieces of liver over her bed of live coals frances offered to cook them all on her stick but
i being the smallest child was given the shortest stick and allowed to stand nearest the fire soon the three slices were sizzling and browning from the ends of three willow rods and smelled so good that we could hardly wait for them to be done
then led us to the house where a number of persons had gathered most of them sitting at table laughing and talking and among them elitha and leanna upon our entrance the merriment ceased and all eyes were turned inquiringly toward us
some one pointed to him who sat beside our eldest sister and gayly said look at your new brother another asked
tears came also to the child wifes eyes as she clasped her arms about us soothingly assuring us that she was still our sister and would care for us nevertheless
she and her husband slipped away soon on horseback and we were told that we were to stay at our neighbors until they returned for us
and some in their eagerness forgot to roll down their sleeves before they began to talk one triumphantly repeated to each newcomer the motherly advice which she gave the young couple when she first
noticed his affection for that sorrowing girl who is too pretty to be in this new country without a protector they also recalled how perry mc coons launch had brought supplies up the river for the second relief to take over the mountains
and how finally he himself had carried to the bereaved daughter the last accounts from donner camp
would she take us three to live with her on that cattle ranch twenty five miles by bridle trail from the fort
while the settlers and their families were contentedly at work developing the resources of the country the astounding cry gold discovered came through the valley like a blight stopping every industry in its wake
excited men women and children rushed to town in quest of information it was furnished by
who had been called away privately two weeks earlier and had just returned in a state of great enthusiasm declaring that gold in dust grains and chunks had been discovered at coloma not more than a days journey from sutters fort
how soon can we get there became the all absorbing problem of eager listeners the only hotel keeper in the town sold his kettles and pans closed his house and departed
shopkeepers packed most of their supplies for immediate shipment and raised the price of those left for home trade men and half grown boys hardly took time to collect a meagre outfit
with the long hoped for report of the ratification of the treaty of peace and general masons proclamation officially announcing it there were not enough men left in the valley outside of the barracks to give a decent round of cheers for the blessing of peace
grandpa brought the news home california is ours there will be no more war no more trouble and no more need of soldiers yet the women felt that their battles and trials had just begun
help your neighbor become the watchwords of the day no one was allowed to suffer through lack of practical sympathy from house to house by turns went the strong to help the weak to bridge their troubles
they went not with cheering words only but with something in store for the empty cupboards
grandma was in such demand that she had little time to rest for there was not a doctor nor a medicine shop in the valley and her parcels of herbs and knowledge of their uses had to serve for both nights she set her shoes handy
so that she could dress quickly when summoned to the sick and dawn of day often marked her home coming georgia and i were led into her work early for we were sent with broths and appetizers to the sick on clearings within walking distances
and she would bid us stay a while at different houses where we could be helpful but to be sure and bring careful reports from each home we entered under such training we learned much about diseases and the care of the suffering anon
we would find in the plain wooden cradle a dainty bundle of sweetness all done up in white
then she would mete out to us that hardest of punishments namely that we were not to speak with each other until she should forgive our offence forgiveness usually came before time to drive up the cows
for she knew that we were nimbler footed when she started us off in happy mood each cow wore a bell of different tone and knew her own name yet it was not an easy task even in pleasant weather to collect the various strings and get them home on time
they mixed and fed with neighbors cattle on the range and hid themselves behind clumps of trees and other convenient obstructions often grandma would get her string in by the main trail and have them milked
before we could bring up the laggards that provokingly dawdled along nibbling stray bunches of grass when late on the road we saw coyotes sneaking out for their evening meal and heard the far away cry of the panther
but we were not much afraid when it was light enough so that imagination could not picture them creeping stealthily behind us our gallant company c officered by captain bartlett and lieutenants stoneman and stone
to the good will of the people and when captain joe hooker brought him out to visit grandmas dairy she too was greatly pleased by his soldierly bearing after he mentioned that he had heard of her interest in the company which had been called away
and that he believed she would find company h equally deserving of her consideration she readily extended to the new men the homelike privileges which the others had enjoyed thus more friends came among us
notable among mine was the old darkey cook at headquarters from whom georgia and i tried to hide the first time she waddled out to our house she searched us out saying now honeys dont yo be so scared of dis ole aunt lucy
lawd honey yo neednt have no punctions bout takin dis yer book
now i wants yo to be nice and yo cant lessen yo can read and talk like de captain done tole me yo mudder done i was delighted with the book and told her so and hugged it all the way home
for it had a beautiful picture near the back showing a little girl with a sprinkling pot watering her garden of stocks sweet williams and hollyhocks her hair was in four long curls and she had trimming on her dress apron and long pantalets
punctions and quality folks i repeated them over and over to myself so that i should be able to tell them to georgia our last visit to aunt lucy must have been prearranged for as she admitted us she said
and mus take yos right in to de general i had never seen a general and was shy about meeting one until after she assured me that only cowards and bad men feared him we walked down the corridor and entered a large room
where an elderly gentleman in uniform sat writing at a table aunt lucy stopped beside him and still holding each by the hand bowed low saying general smith
then she slipped out he was as courteous to us as though we were grown ladies shook hands asked how we felt begged us to be seated and then stepped to a door and called susan susan
who called us honeys and dear little girls she sat between us joining with her husband in earnest inquiries about our stay in the mountains and our home with grandma georgia did most of the talking
i was satisfied just to look at them and hear them speak at the close of our visit with a knowing look she took us to see what aunt lucy had baked the general and she had recently come to pay a last visit to a sick officer
soldiers dug his grave on the hillside north of town and word came from army headquarters that he would be buried on the morrow at midday with military honors georgia and i wanted to know what military honors were
and as it came time for the funeral we gathered with others on the plaza where the procession formed we were deeply impressed the emigrants uncovered and bowed their heads reverently but the soldiers in line with guns reversed
stood erect and motionless as figures in stone while the bier of the dead was being carried through open ranks to the waiting caisson the coffin was covered with a flag and upon it lay his chapeau gauntlets sash and sword
only soldiers stood close around the grave and heard what was read by the officer who stood at its head with an open book in one hand and a drawn sword in the other
captain frisbie wedding festivities the masterpiece of grandmas youth senora vallejo jakies return his death a cherokee indian who had stood by my fathers grave
captain frisbie spent much time in sonoma after company h was disbanded and observing ones remarked that the attraction was miss fannie vallejo yet not until eighteen fifty one did the general consent to part with his first born daughter
she anticipated the coming event with interest and pleasure because the prolonged and brilliant festivities would afford her an opportunity to display her fancy and talent in butter modelling for the work she did not charge
in the evenings after candle light we three gathered her implements were a circular hardwood board a paddle a set of small well pointed sticks
she talked and modelled and we listening watched the fascinating process saw her take the plastic substance fashion a duck with ducklings on a pond a lamb curled up asleep
and a couched lion with shaggy head resting upon his fore paws we watched her press beads of proper size and color into the eye sockets skilfully finish the base upon which each figure lay
then twist a lump of butter into a square of fine muslin and deftly squeeze until it crinkled through the meshes in form of fleece for the lambs coat
then use a different mesh to produce the strands for the lions mane and the tuft for the end of his tail in exuberant delight we exclaimed oh grandma how did you learn to make such wonderful things
i did not learn it is a gift she replied then she spoke of her modelling in childhood and her subsequent masterpiece which had won the commendation of napoleon and empress josephine at that auspicious time she was but eighteen years of age
and second cook in the principal tavern of neuchatel switzerland georgia and i sat entranced as with animated words and gestures she pictured the appearance of the buglers and heralds who came weeks in advance
and empress would arrive in that town and dine at the tavern then the excitement and enthusiastic preparations which followed
and what a centrepiece it was it required the careful handling of no less than three persons to get it in place on the table where the emperor might see at a glance the groups of figures along the splendid highway
of the snow white poodle snuggled close in the empresss arms then she told how she heard a heavy thud by the kitchen fire which made her rush back only to discover that the head cook had fallen to the floor in a faint
she gave the quick call which brought the frau wirthin to the scene of confusion where in mute agony she looked from servant to servant until with hands clasped and eyes full of tears she implored marie
take the higher place for the day and with gods help make no mistake then she went on to say that while the dinner was being served the emperor admired the butter piece and on hearing that it was the work of a young maidservant in the house
that she was nervous from added responsibilities and not dressed for presentation cried with quivering lips
the great emperor asks to see thee and thou must come she told how poor red faced bewildered marie dropped her ladle and stared at the speaker
then rolled down her sleeves while the frau wirthin tied her own best white apron around her waist at the same time instructing her in the manner in which she must hold her dress at the sides between thumb and forefinger and spread the skirt wide
yet after it was all over she was informed that the emperor and empress had spoken kindly to her and that she herself had made her bow and backed out of the room admirably for one in her position
the emperor and the empress she now finished her modelling with a dainty centrepiece for the brides table and let me go with her when she carried it to the vallejo mansion it gave great satisfaction and while the family and guests were admiring it
senora vallejo took me by the hand saying in her own musical tongue come little daughter and play while you wait she led me to a room that had pictures on the walls and left me surrounded by toys but i could not play
my eyes wandered about until they became riveted on one corner of the room where stood a childs crib which looked like gold its head and foot boards were embellished with figures of angels
and a canopy of lace like a fleecy cloud hovered over them the bed was white but the pillows were covered with pink silk and encased in slips of linen lawn exquisite with rare needlework
i touched it before i left the room wondering what the little girl dreamed in that beautiful bed and on the way home grandma and i discussed all these things
the linen pillow slips were as fine as those senorita isabella fitch showed me when she gave me the few highly prized lessons in simple drawn work and her cousin senorita leese had taught me hemming
these young ladies were related to the vallejos and also lived in large houses facing the plaza and were always kind to georgia and me in fact some of my sweetest memories of sonoma are associated with these three spanish homes
their people never asked unfeeling questions nor repeated harrowing tales and i did not learn until i was grown that they had been among the large contributors to the fund for the relief of our party
i have a faint recollection of listening to the chimes of the wedding bells and later of hearing that captain frisbie had taken his bride away but that is all for about that time dear old jakie returned to us in ill health and our thoughts and care turned to him
i have done my best with the medicines at hand the only thing that remains to be tried is a tea steeped from the nettle root that may give relief as soon as we could get ready after the doctor uttered those words georgia and i equipped with hoe
while i cut them off and hoed up the roots the plants towered luxuriantly above our heads making the task extremely painful
no sooner would i commence operations than the branches slipping from under the stick would brush georgias face and strike my hands and arms with stinging force and by the time we had secured the required number of roots we were covered with fiery welts
the one in front staggering and his squaw behind making frantic motions to us to hurry over the snake fence near by this we did as speedily as possible and succeeded none too soon for as we reached the ground on the safe side he stopped us
and angrily demanded the contents of our basket we opened it and when he saw what it contained he stamped his wabbling foot and motioned us to be off we obeyed with alacrity for it was our first experience with a drunken indian
and greatly alarmed us the tea may have eased jakies pain but it did not accomplish what we had hoped
after the lawyer went away grandma told us that jakie had willed us each fifty dollars in gold and the rest of his property to grandpa and herself a few weeks later when the sap ceased flowing to the branches of the trees and the yellow leaves were falling
grandpa had the grave enclosed with a white paling and we children planted castilian rose bushes at the head and foot of the mound and carried water to them from the house and in time their branches met and the grave was a bed of fragrant blossoms
one day as i was returning from it with my empty pail a tidy black eyed woman came up to me and said im a cherokee indian the wife of one of the three drovers that sold the brunners them long horned cattle that was delivered the other day
some of the scottish emigrants heated with republican enthusiasm and utterly destitute of the skill necessary to the conduct of great affairs employed all their industry and ingenuity
but he was placed under the control of a committee
where the expedition should land to appoint officers to superintend the levying of troops to dole out provisions and ammunition all that was left to the general was to direct the evolutions of the army in the field
and he was forced to promise that even in the field except in the case of a surprise he would do nothing without the assent of a council of war monmouth was to command in england his soft mind had as usual
taken an impress from the society which surrounded him ambitious hopes which had seemed to be extinguished revived in his bosom he remembered the affection with which he had been constantly greeted by the common people in town and country
and expected that they would now rise by hundreds of thousands to welcome him he remembered the good will which the soldiers had always borne him and flattered himself that they would come over to him by regiments
encouraging messages reached him in quick succession from london he was assured that the violence and injustice with which the elections had been carried on had driven the nation mad
that the prudence of the leading whigs had with difficulty prevented a sanguinary outbreak on the day of the coronation and that all the great lords who had supported the exclusion bill were impatient to rally round him
wildman who loved to talk treason in parables sent to say that the earl of richmond just two hundred years before had landed in england with a handful of men and had a few days later been crowned on the field of bosworth
all that was required of him was to promise that he would not assume the regal title
it was determined that two englishmen
should accompany argyle to scotland and that fletcher should go with monmouth to england fletcher from the beginning had augured ill of the enterprise but his chivalrous spirit would not suffer him to decline a risk which his friends seemed eager to encounter
when grey repeated with approbation what wildman had said about richmond and richard the well read and thoughtful scot justly remarked that there was a great difference between the fifteenth century and the seventeenth
richmond was assured of the support of barons each of whom could bring an army of feudal retainers into the field
a sum sufficient for the two expeditions very little was obtained from london six thousand pounds had been expected thence but instead of the money came excuses from wildman
but his intellect and his temper preserved him from the violence of a partisan he had lived on confidential terms with shaftesbury and had thus incurred the displeasure of the court lockes prudence had however
been such that it would have been to little purpose to bring him even before the corrupt and partial tribunals of that age in one point however he was vulnerable he was a student of christ church in the university of oxford
but this was not easy locke had at oxford abstained from expressing any opinion on the politics of the day spies had been set about him doctors of divinity and masters of arts
to the exclusion bill and to the character of the earl of shaftesbury but in vain locke neither broke out nor dissembled but maintained such steady silence and composure as forced the tools of power to own with vexation
that never man was so complete a master of his tongue and of his passions when it was found that treachery could do nothing arbitrary power was used after vainly trying to inveigle locke into a fault
the government resolved to punish him without one orders came from whitehall that he should be ejected and those orders the dean and canons made haste to obey
locke was travelling on the continent for his health when he learned that he had been deprived of his home and of his bread without a trial or even a notice
the injustice with which he had been treated would have excused him if he had resorted to violent methods of redress but he was not to be blinded by personal resentment he augured no good from the schemes
but it was apprehended that argyle would shortly appear in arms among his clansmen a proclamation was accordingly issued directing that scotland should be put into a state of defence the militia was ordered to be in readiness
all the clans hostile to the name of campbell were set in motion john murray marquess of athol
and at the head of a great body of his followers
who had long resided in england as ambassador from the united provinces and everard van dykvelt who after the death of charles had been sent by the state general on a special mission of condolence and congratulation
the king said that he had received from unquestionable sources intelligence of designs which were forming against the throne by his banished subjects in holland some of the exiles were cutthroats
whom nothing but the special providence of god had prevented from committing a foul murder and among them was the owner of the spot which had been fixed for the butchery
argyle has the greatest means of annoying me and of all places holland is that whence a blow may be best aimed against me the dutch envoys assured his majesty that what he had said should instantly be communicated to the government
were at this time most desirous that the hospitality of their country
james had lately held language which encouraged the hope that he would not patiently submit to the ascendancy of france it seemed probable that he would consent to form a close alliance with the united provinces and the house of austria
there was therefore at the hague an extreme anxiety to avoid all that could give him offence the personal interest of william was also on this occasion identical with the interest of his father in law
but the case was one which required rapid and vigorous action and the nature of the batavian institutions made such action almost impossible the union of utrecht
for the purpose of meeting immediate exigencies had never been deliberately revised and perfected in a time of tranquillity every one of the seven commonwealths
which that union had bound together retained almost all the rights of sovereignty and asserted those rights punctiliously against the central government
as the federal authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the provincial authorities so the provincial authorities had not the means of exacting prompt obedience from the municipal authorities
holland alone contained eighteen cities each of which was for many purposes an independent state jealous of all interference from without if the rulers of such a city received from the hague an order
which was unpleasing to them they either neglected it altogether or executed it languidly and tardily in some town councils indeed the influence of the prince of orange was all powerful
but unfortunately the place where the british exiles had congregated and where their ships had been fitted out was the rich and populous amsterdam and the magistrates of amsterdam were the heads of the faction hostile to the federal government
and to the house of nassau the naval administration of the united provinces was conducted by five distinct boards of admiralty one of those boards sate at amsterdam was partly nominated by the authorities of that city
and seems to have been entirely animated by their spirit all the endeavours of the federal government to effect what james desired were frustrated by the evasions of the functionaries of amsterdam and by the blunders of colonel bevil skelton
then instead of applying as he should have done to the states general who sate close to his own door
with a request that the suspected ships might be detained the magistrates of amsterdam answered that the entrance of the zuyder zee was out of their jurisdiction and referred him to the federal government it was notorious that this was a mere excuse
and that if there had been any real wish at the stadthouse of amsterdam to prevent argyle from sailing no difficulties would have been made skelton now addressed himself to the states general they showed every disposition to comply with his demand
departed from the course which they ordinarily observed in the transaction of business on the same day on which he made his application to them an order drawn in exact conformity with his request
was despatched to the admiralty of amsterdam but this order in consequence of some misinformation did not correctly describe the situation of the ships they were said to be in the texel
would in a moment have put an end to his expedition round his little fleet a boat was rowing in which were some persons with telescopes whom he suspected to be spies but no effectual step was taken for the purpose of detaining him
and on the afternoon of the second of may he stood out to sea before a favourable breeze the voyage was prosperous on the sixth the orkneys were in sight argyle very unwisely anchored off kirkwall
and allowed two of his followers to go on shore there the bishop ordered them to be arrested the refugees proceeded to hold a long and animated debate on this misadventure
for from the beginning to the end of their expedition however languid and irresolute their conduct might be they never in debate wanted spirit or perseverance some were for an attack on kirkwall
some were for proceeding without delay to argyleshire at last the earl seized some gentlemen who lived near the coast of the island and proposed to the bishop an exchange of prisoners the bishop returned no answer and the fleet
after losing three days sailed away this delay was full of danger it was speedily known at edinburgh that the rebel squadron had touched at the orkneys troops were instantly put in motion
when the earl reached his own province he found that preparations had been made to repel him at dunstaffnage he sent his second son charles on shore to call the campbells to arms but charles returned with gloomy tidings
the herdsmen and fishermen were indeed ready to rally round mac callum more but of the heads of the clan some were in confinement and others had fled those gentlemen who remained at their homes were either well affected to the government
or afraid of moving and refused even to see the son of their chief from dunstaffnage the small armament proceeded to campbelltown near the southern extremity of the peninsula of kintyre
here the earl published a manifesto drawn up in holland under the direction of the committee by james stewart a scotch advocate whose pen was a few months later employed in a very different way
in this paper were set forth with a strength of language sometimes approaching to scurrility many real and some imaginary grievances it was hinted that the late king had died by poison
a chief object of the expedition was declared to be the entire suppression

who also commanded them to depart from thence and to dwell in charan and when there was a famine over all the land they went down into egypt and there for four hundred years were so multiplied
and made slaves of them to labour in clay and brick in the building of his cities they cried to their lord and he struck the whole land of egypt

we cannot resist them because their god will defend them

which was the big news of the day and how could i not have been
this mystery puzzled me finding it impossible to form any views i drifted from one extreme to the other something was out there that much was certain and any doubting thomas was invited to place his finger on the scotias wound when i arrived in new york
also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage and again because of this speed of movement so only two possible solutions to the question were left creating two very distinct groups of supporters
it couldnt stand up to inquiries conducted in both the new world and the old that a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal was less than probable where and when had he built it and how could he have built it in secret
only some government could own such an engine of destruction and in these disaster filled times when men tax their ingenuity to build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons it was possible that unknown to the rest of the world some nation could have been testing such a fearsome machine
and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down at least i hope it will but this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal denials from the various governments
since the public interest was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering
besides how could the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual and certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers
so after inquiries conducted in england france russia prussia spain italy america and even turkey the hypothesis of an underwater monitor was ultimately rejected and so the monster surfaced again
despite the endless witticisms heaped on it by the popular press
after i arrived in new york several people did me the honor of consulting me on the phenomenon in question in france i had published a two volume work in quarto entitled the mysteries of the great ocean depths well received in scholarly circles
my views were in demand
i confined myself to a flat no comment but soon pinned to the wall i had to explain myself straight out and in this vein the honorable pierre aronnax professor at the paris museum was summoned by the new york herald to formulate his views no matter what
i complied since i could no longer hold my tongue i let it wag i discussed the question in its every aspect both political and scientific and this is an excerpt from the well padded article i published in the issue of april thirtieth
therefore i wrote after examining these different hypotheses one by one we are forced every other supposition having been refuted to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal
the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us no soundings have been able to reach them what goes on in those distant depths what creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water
what is the constitution of these animals its almost beyond conjecture however the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the form of a choice between two alternatives either we know every variety of creature populating our planet or we do not
if we do not know every one of them if nature still keeps ichthyological secrets from us nothing is more admissible than to accept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera animals with a basically cast iron constitution
that inhabit strata beyond the reach of our soundings and which some development or other an urge or a whim if you prefer can bring to the upper level of the ocean for long intervals if on the other hand we do know every living species
we must look for the animal in question among those marine creatures already cataloged and in this event i would be inclined to accept the existence of a giant narwhale
increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold then give this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its offensive weapons and you have the animal were looking for it would have the proportions determined by the officers of the shannon
the instrument needed to perforate the scotia and the power to pierce a steamers hull in essence the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword or lance as certain naturalists have expressed it its a king sized tooth as hard as steel
which the narwhale attacks with invariable success others have been wrenched not without difficulty
owns one of these tusks with a length of two point two five meters and a width at its base of forty eight centimeters all right then imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the animal ten times more powerful
launch it at a speed of twenty miles per hour multiply its mass times its velocity and you get just the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe so until information becomes more abundant i plump for a sea unicorn of colossal dimensions
no longer armed with a mere lance but with an actual spur like ironclad frigates or those warships called rams whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously this inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away
these last words were cowardly of me but as far as i could i wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter from the americans who when they do laugh laugh raucously
i had left myself a loophole yet deep down i had accepted the existence of the monster my article was hotly debated causing a fine old uproar
moreover the solution it proposed allowed for free play of the imagination the human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures now then the sea is precisely their best medium
our creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually made smaller with its untold depths couldnt the sea keep alive such huge specimens of life from another age
continuous alteration couldnt the heart of the ocean hide the last remaining varieties of these titanic species for whom years are centuries and centuries millennia but i mustnt let these fantasies run away with me
enough of these fairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities i repeat opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent
yet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved more practical people especially in america and england were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster to insure the safety of transoceanic travel
the shipping and mercantile gazette the lloyds list frances packetboat and maritime and colonial review all the rags devoted to insurance companies who threatened to raise their premium rates were unanimous on this point
the naval arsenals were unlocked for commander farragut who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate but as it always happens just when a decision had been made to chase the monster the monster put in no further appearances
for two months nobody heard a word about it not a single ship encountered it apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven around it people were constantly babbling about the creature even via the atlantic cable
accordingly the wags claimed that this slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the most of it so the frigate was equipped for a far off voyage and armed with fearsome fishing gear but nobody knew where to steer it and impatience grew until on june second
word came that the tampico a steamer on the san francisco line sailing from california to shanghai had sighted the animal again three weeks before in the northerly seas of the pacific this news caused intense excitement
not even a twenty four hour breather was granted to commander farragut his provisions were loaded on board his coal bunkers were overflowing not a crewman was missing from his post to cast off he needed only to fire and stoke his furnaces half a days delay would have been unforgivable
chapter three as master wishes three seconds before the arrival of j b hobsons letter
i understood at last that my true vocation my sole purpose in life was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections but now nothing could hold me back i forgot everything else and without another thought of exhaustion friends or collections
i accepted the american governments offer besides i mused all roads lead home to europe and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of france that fine animal may even let itself be captured in european seas as a personal favor to me
conseil i called in an impatient voice conseil was my manservant a devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys a gallant flemish boy whom i genuinely liked and who returned the compliment a born stoic punctilious on principle
habitually hardworking rarely startled by lifes surprises very skillful with his hands efficient in his every duty and despite his having a name that means counsel never giving advice not even the unsolicited kind
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two in conseil i had a seasoned specialist in biological classification an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility
up and down the whole ladder of branches groups classes subclasses orders families genera subgenera species and varieties but there his science came to a halt classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else
well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale and yet what a fine gallant lad
for the past ten years conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo
no matter how far off it was he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment moreover he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments owned solid muscles but hadnt a nerve in him not a sign of nerves the mental type i mean
the lad was thirty years old and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting i had turned forty but conseil had one flaw he was a fanatic on formality
and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome conseil i repeated while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure to be sure i had confidence in this devoted lad
there was good reason to stop and think even for the worlds most emotionless man
conseil i called a third time conseil appeared
yes my boy get my things ready get yours ready were departing in two hours as master wishes conseil replied serenely we havent a moment to lose pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks
dont bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry what about masters collections conseil ventured to observe well deal with them later what the archaeotherium hyracotherium oreodonts cheiropotamus and masters other fossil skeletons
certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour whatever detour master wishes oh its nothing really a route slightly less direct thats all were leaving on the abraham lincoln
as master thinks best conseil replied placidly you see my friend its an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale were going to rid the seas of it the author of a two volume work in quarto on the mysteries of the great ocean depths
its a glorious mission but also a dangerous one
these beasts can be quite unpredictable but were going just the same we have a commander whos game for anything what master does ill do conseil replied
as master wishes a quarter of an hour later our trunks were ready conseil did them in a flash and i was sure the lad hadnt missed a thing because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals
the hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine i went down a short stair leading to the ground floor
i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
for a fare of twenty francs the vehicle went down broadway to union square
that great new york annex located on the left bank of the east river and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the abraham lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate
i rushed aboard i asked for commander farragut one of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me professor pierre aronnax he said to me
the same i replied commander farragut in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you i bowed and letting the commander attend to getting under way i was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me
the abraham lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean the frigates interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues i was well satisfied with my cabin
which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess well be quite comfortable here i told conseil with all due respect to master conseil replied as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk
just then commander farragut was giving orders to cast off the last moorings holding the abraham lincoln to its brooklyn pier and so if id been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less
the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism but commander farragut didnt want to waste a single day
at this order which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device the mechanics activated the start up wheel steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves long horizontal pistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft
the blades of the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed and the abraham lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator laden escort of some one hundred ferries and tenders authors note tenders are small steamboats that assist the big liners
the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
the wonderful right bank of this river all loaded down with country homes and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons
whose thirty nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail
it hugged this sand covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us one more time the escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to upper new york bay
chapter five at random for some while the voyage of the abraham lincoln was marked by no incident but one circumstance arose that displayed ned lands marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in him
off the falkland islands on june thirtieth the frigate came in contact with a fleet of american whalers and we learned that they hadnt seen the narwhale but one of them the captain of the monroe
anxious to see ned land at work commander farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the monroe and the canadian had such good luck that with a right and left shot he harpooned not one whale but two striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other after a few minutes chase
assuredly if the monster ever had to deal with ned lands harpoon i wouldnt bet on the monster the frigate sailed along the east coast of south america with prodigious speed by july third we were at the entrance to the strait of magellan abreast of cabo de las virgenes
and maneuvered instead to double cape horn the crew sided with him unanimously indeed were we likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait many of our sailors swore that the monster couldnt negotiate this passageway simply because hes too big for it
near three oclock in the afternoon on july sixth fifteen miles south of shore the abraham lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of the south american continent that stray rock dutch seamen had named cape horn after their hometown of hoorn
our course was set for the northwest and the next day our frigates propeller finally churned the waters of the pacific open your eyes open your eyes repeated the sailors of the abraham lincoln and they opened amazingly wide eyes and spyglasses
a bit dazzled it is true by the vista of two thousand dollars didnt remain at rest for an instant day and night we observed the surface of the ocean and those with nyctalopic eyes whose ability to see in the dark increased their chances by fifty percent
i no longer left the ships deck sometimes bending over the forecastle railings sometimes leaning against the sternrail
and how many times i shared the excitement of general staff and crew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves in an instant the frigates deck would become densely populated the cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors and officers
with panting chests and anxious eyes we each would observe the cetaceans movements i stared i stared until i nearly went blind from a worn out retina while conseil as stoic as ever kept repeating to me in a calm tone
if masters eyes would kindly stop bulging master will see farther but what a waste of energy the abraham lincoln would change course and race after the animal sighted only to find an ordinary baleen whale
or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of curses however the weather held good our voyage was proceeding under the most favorable conditions by then it was the bad season in these southernmost regions
because july in this zone corresponds to our january in europe but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over a vast perimeter ned land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism
but this stubborn canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin a hundred times i chided him for his unconcern bah he replied nothings out there professor aronnax
and if there is some animal what chance would we have of spotting it cant you see were just wandering around at random people say theyve sighted this slippery beast again in the pacific high seas im truly willing to believe it but two months have already gone by since then
and judging by your narwhales personality it hates growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways its blessed with a terrific gift for getting around now professor you know even better than i that nature doesnt violate good sense
these bearings determined the frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central pacific commander farragut felt and with good reason that it was best to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or islands
no doubt our bosun said because there isnt enough water for him
then cut the tropic of cancer at longitude one hundred thirty two degrees and headed for the seas of china we were finally in the area of the monsters latest antics and in all honesty shipboard conditions became life threatening hearts were pounding hideously
nobody ate nobody slept twenty times a day some error in perception or the optical illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees would cause intolerable anguish and this emotion repeated twenty times over
kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow and this reaction wasnt long in coming for three months during which each day seemed like a century the abraham lincoln plowed all the northerly seas of the pacific
racing after whales sighted abruptly veering off course swerving sharply from one tack to another stopping suddenly putting on steam and reversing engines in quick succession at the risk of stripping its gears
and it didnt leave a single point unexplored from the beaches of japan to the coasts of america and we found nothing nothing except an immenseness of deserted waves nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale or an underwater islet
and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed with typical human fickleness they jumped from one extreme to the other inevitably the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents
this reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship from the quarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff and for certain if it hadnt been for commander farraguts characteristic stubbornness the frigate would ultimately have put back to that cape in the south
never had the crew of an american naval craft shown more patience and zeal
a request to this effect was presented to the commander the commander stood his ground his sailors couldnt hide their discontent and their work suffered because of it im unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board
and the abraham lincoln would chart a course toward european seas this promise was given on november second it had the immediate effect of reviving the crews failing spirits the ocean was observed with renewed care
each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his experience spyglasses functioned with feverish energy a supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale and the latter had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this summons to appear
two days passed the abraham lincoln stayed at half steam
a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its apathy enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake to the great satisfaction i must say of assorted sharks
while the abraham lincoln heaved to its longboats radiated in every direction around it and didnt leave a single point of the sea unexplored but the evening of november fourth arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved
by then the frigate lay in latitude thirty one degrees fifteen north and longitude one hundred thirty six degrees forty two east the shores of japan were less than two hundred miles to our leeward night was coming on eight oclock had just struck
huge clouds covered the moons disk then in its first quarter the sea undulated placidly beneath the frigates stempost just then i was in the bow leaning over the starboard rail conseil stationed beside me stared straight ahead
roosting in the shrouds the crew examined the horizon which shrank and darkened little by little officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night glasses sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds
then all traces of light vanished into the darkness observing conseil i discovered that just barely the gallant lad had fallen under the general influence at least so i thought perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history
come on conseil i told him heres your last chance to pocket that two thousand dollars if master will permit my saying so conseil replied i never expected to win that prize
in masters little apartment conseil answered in masters museum
and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town quite so conseil and whats more
to be sure conseil replied serenely i do think theyll have fun at masters expense and must it be said it must be said conseil well then it will serve master right
how true when one has the honor of being an expert as master is one mustnt lay himself open to conseil didnt have time to complete the compliment in the midst of the general silence a voice became audible
the next saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the donnithorne arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very day no less than a second appearance of the smart man in top boots
the personal witness to the strangers visit pronounced contemptuously to be nothing better than a bailiff such as satchell had been before him no one had thought of denying mister cassons testimony to the fact that he had seen the stranger nevertheless
he proffered various corroborating circumstances i see him myself he said i see him coming along by the crab tree meadow on a bald faced hoss id just been t hev a pint
and just as i come up by the big ash tree i see the man top boots coming along on a bald faced hoss i wish i may never stir if i didnt and i stood still till he come up and i says good morning sir
i says for i wanted to hear the turn of his tongue as i might know whether he was a this country man so i says good morning sir it ll old hup for the barley this morning i think therell be a bit got hin if weve good luck
youre about as near the right language as a pigs squeaking is like a tune played on a key bugle well i dont know
i should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by
aye aye man said bartle with a tone of sarcastic consolation you talk the right language for you when mike holdsworths goat says ba a a its all right it ud be unnatural for it to make any other noise
the rest of the party being loamsnire men
and wisely fell back on the previous question which far from being exhausted in a single evening was renewed in the churchyard before service the next day with the fresh interest conferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it
and that fresh hearer was martin poyser who as his wife said
she always cited it afterwards as a case of prevision which really had something more in it than her own remarkable penetration that the moment she set eyes on the squire she said to herself i shouldna wonder if hes come about that man
as is a going to take the chase farm wanting poyser to do something for him without pay but poysers a fool if he does
for the old squires visits to his tenantry were rare and though missus poyser had during the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches meaning even more than met the ear
the speeches had always remained imaginary good day missus poyser said the old squire peering at her with his short sighted eyes a mode of looking at her which as missus poyser observed allays aggravated me
it was as if you was a insect and he was going to dab his finger nail on you however she said your servant sir and curtsied with an air of perfect deference as she advanced towards him she was not the woman to misbehave towards her betters
and fly in the face of the catechism without severe provocation is your husband at home missus poyser yes sir hes only the rick yard ill send for him in a minute if youll please to get down and step in
thank you i will do so i want to consult him about a little matter but you are quite as much concerned in it if not more i must have your opinion too hetty run and tell your uncle to come in
said missus poyser as they entered the house and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to hettys curtsy while totty conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry jam stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round furtively
what a fine old kitchen this is said mister donnithorne looking round admiringly he always spoke in the same deliberate well chiselled polite way whether his words were sugary or venomous
and you keep it so exquisitely clean missus poyser i like these premises do you know beyond any on the estate well sir since youre fond of em
i should be glad if youd let a bit o repairs be done to em for the boardings that state as were like to be eaten up wi rats and mice and the cellar you may stan up to your knees water int if you like to go down but perhaps youd rather believe my words
not yet i must see your dairy
on all hands about your fine cheese and butter said the squire looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which he and missus poyser might happen to disagree i think i see the door open there
you must not be surprised if i cast a covetous eye on your cream and butter i dont expect that missus satchells cream and butter will bear comparison with yours i cant say sir im sure its seldom i see other folkss butter
though theres some on it as ones no need to see the smells enough
but keeping near the door im sure i should like my breakfast better if i knew the butter and cream came from this dairy thank you that really is a pleasant sight unfortunately my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp
ill sit down in your comfortable kitchen ah poyser how do you do in the midst of business i see as usual ive been looking at your wifes beautiful dairy
mister poyser had just entered in shirt sleeves and open waistcoat with a face a shade redder than usual from the exertion of pitching as he stood red rotund and radiant
said the old gentleman seating himself on a small chair near the door do you know missus poyser sit down pray both of you ive been far from contented for some time with missus satchells dairy management
i think she has not a good method as you have indeed sir i cant speak to that said missus poyser in a hard voice rolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window as she continued to stand opposite the squire
poyser might sit down if he liked she thought she wasnt going to sit down as if shed give in to any such smooth tongued palaver mister poyser who looked and felt the reverse of icy did sit down in his three cornered chair
and now poyser as satchell is laid up i am intending to let the chase farm to a respectable tenant im tired of having a farm on my own hands nothing is made the best of in such cases as you know
said mister poyser with a good natured blankness of imagination as to the nature of the arrangement if im called upon to speak sir said missus poyser after glancing at her husband with pity at his softness you know better than me
not but what im glad to hear o anybody respectable coming into the parish theres some
youre likely to find mister thurle an excellent neighbour i assure you such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little plan im going to mention especially as i hope you will find it as much to your own advantage as his
indeed sir if its anything t our advantage
i think folks have to wait long enough afore its brought to em the fact is poyser said the squire ignoring missus poysers theory of worldly prosperity
now the plan im thinking of is to effect a little exchange if you were to have the hollow pastures you might increase your dairy which must be so profitable under your wifes management and i should request you missus poyser
than corn land mister poyser was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees his head on one side and his mouth screwed up
he was much too acute a man not to see through the whole business and to foresee perfectly what would be his wifes view of the subject but he disliked giving unpleasant answers unless it was on a point of farming practice
he would rather give up than have a quarrel any day and after all it mattered more to his wife than to him so after a few moments silence he looked up at her and said mildly what dost say
missus poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity during his silence but now she turned away her head with a toss looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow shed and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin
held it firmly between her clasped hands say why i say you may do as you like
i know theres them as is born t own the land and them as is born to sweat ont here missus poyser paused to gasp a little and i know its christened folkss duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and
blood ull bear it but ill not make a martyr o myself and wear myself to skin and bone and worret myself as if i was a churn wi butter a coming int for no landlord in england not if he was king george himself
no no my dear missus poyser certainly not said the squire still confident in his own powers of persuasion you must not overwork yourself
but dont you think your work will rather be lessened than increased in this way there is so much milk required at the abbey that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the addition to your dairy
that it was not in this case a purely abstract question i daresay said missus poyser bitterly turning her head half way towards her husband and looking at the vacant arm chair i daresay its true for men
wi ins an outs to fit int everything else if you could make a pudding wi thinking o the batter it ud be easy getting dinner
whats to make me sure as the house wont be put o board wage afore were many months older and then
o nights wi twenty gallons o milk on my mind and dingall ull take no more butter let alone paying for it
and lose half of em wi the measles and theres the fetching and carrying as ud be welly half a days work for a man an hoss thats to be took out o the profits i reckon but theres folks ud hold a sieve under the pump
that difficulty about the fetching and carrying you will not have missus poyser said the squire who thought that this entrance into particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on missus poysers part
bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony oh sir begging your pardon ive never been used t having gentlefolkss servants coming about my back places a making love to both the gells at once
and keeping em with their hands on their hips listening to all manner o gossip when they should be down on their knees a scouring if were to go to ruin it shanna be wi having our back kitchen turned into a public well poyser
and i shall not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a neighbour i know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three years when the present one expires otherwise i daresay thurle who is a man of some capital
even without the final threat her husband really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old place where he had been bred and born for he believed the old squire had small spite enough for anything
was beginning a mild remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and sell more stock with
when missus poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say out this once though it were to rain notices to quit and the only shelter were the work house then sir if i may speak as
sign her soul away ive a right to speak for i make one quarter o the rent and save another quarter
wi the cellar full o water and frogs and toads hoppin up the steps by dozens and the floors rotten and the rats and mice gnawing every bit o cheese and runnin over our heads as we lie bed till we expect em to eat us up alive
as its a mercy they hanna eat the children long ago
till a place tumbles down and not then ony wi begging and praying and having to pay half and being strung up wi the rent as its much if he gets enough out o the land to pay for all hes put his own money into the ground beforehand see
if youll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that a maggot must be born the rotten cheese to like it i reckon you may run away from my words sir continued missus poyser following the old squire beyond the door
for after the first moments of stunned surprise he had got up and waving his hand towards her with a smile had walked out towards his pony but it was impossible for him to get away immediately for john was walking the pony up and down the yard
and was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned you may run away from my words sir and you may go spinnin underhand ways o doing us a mischief for youve got old harry to your friend though nobody else is
for want o knowing how t undo the tackle
as speaks my mind theres plenty o the same way o thinking this parish
for your names no better than a brimstone match in everybodys nose if it isna two three old folks as you think o saving your soul by giving em a bit o flannel and a drop o porridge an you may be right thinking itll take but little to save your soul
there are occasions on which two servant girls and a waggoner may be a formidable audience and as the squire rode away on his black pony even the gift of short sightedness did not prevent him from being aware that molly
and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the ponys heels carried out the idea of missus poysers solo in an impressive quartet missus poyser however had no sooner seen the pony move off than she turned round
gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them into the back kitchen and unspearing her knitting began to knit again with her usual rapidity as she re entered the house theest done it now said mister poyser
a little alarmed and uneasy but not without some triumphant amusement at his wifes outbreak yes i know ive done it said missus poyser
theres no pleasure living if youre to be corked up for ever and only dribble your mind out by the sly like a leaky barrel i shant repent saying what i think
and theres little likelihood for it seems as if them as arent wanted here are th
this michaelmas twelvemonth said mister poyser and going into a strange parish where thee knowst nobody itll be hard upon us both
theres plenty o things may happen between this and michaelmas twelvemonth the captain may be master afore them for what we know said missus poyser inclined to take an unusually hopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought about by her own merit
and not by other peoples fault im none for worreting said mister poyser rising from his three cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door
with two beds in it one laid on the floor it is ten oclock on thursday night and the dark wall opposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the one dip candle by which bartle massey is pretending to read
the neglected beard of a man just risen from a sick bed his heavy black hair hangs over his forehead and there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off that he may be more awake to what is around him
he has one arm over the back of the chair and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands he is roused by a knock at the door
said bartle massey rising hastily and unfastening the door it was mister irwine adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect as mister irwine approached him and took his hand im late adam
let us all sit down adam took his chair again mechanically and bartle for whom there was no chair remaining sat on the bed in the background have you seen her sir
yes adam i and the chaplain have both been with her this evening did you ask her sir did you say anything about me yes said mister irwine with some hesitation
it is not only you some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow creatures she has scarcely said anything more than no either to me or the chaplain three or four days ago before you were mentioned to her
when i asked her if there was any one of her family whom she would like to see to whom she could open her mind she said with a violent shudder tell them not to come near me i wont see any of them
if they now urge you strongly to go and see her to morrow morning even without her consent
that the interview might affect her favourably but i grieve to say i have scarcely any hope of that she didnt seem agitated when i mentioned your name she only said no in the same cold obstinate way as usual
and if the meeting had no good effect on her it would be pure useless suffering to you severe suffering i fear she is very much changed adam started up from his chair
and seized his hat which lay on the table but he stood still then and looked at mister irwine as if he had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter bartle massey rose quietly turned the key in the door
and put it in his pocket is he come back said adam at last no he is not said mister irwine quietly lay down your hat adam unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air
i fear you have not been out again to day you neednt deceive me sir said adam looking hard at mister irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion you neednt be afraid of me i only want justice
i want him to feel what she feels its his work she was a child as it ud ha gone t anybodys heart to look at i dont care what shes done it was him brought her to it and he shall know it he shall feel it
to sin and misery im not deceiving you adam said mister irwine arthur donnithorne is not come back was not come back when i left i have left a letter for him he will know
he will know he will suffer long and bitterly he has a heart and a conscience i cant be entirely deceived in his character i am convinced
he may be weak but he is not callous not coldly selfish i am persuaded
all his life why do you crave vengeance in this way no amount of torture that you could inflict on him could benefit her no o god no adam groaned out sinking on his chair again
but then thats the deepest curse of all thats what makes the blackness of it it can never be undone my poor hetty she can never be my sweet hetty again the prettiest thing god had made
smiling up at me i thought she loved me and was good adams voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone as if he were only talking to himself but now he said abruptly looking at mister irwine
but she isnt as guilty as they say you dont think she is sir she cant ha done it that perhaps can never be known with certainty adam mister irwine answered gently
in these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us strong evidence and yet for want of knowing some small fact our judgment is wrong but suppose the worst you have no right to say
that the guilt of her crime lies with him and that he ought to bear the punishment it is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution we find it impossible to avoid mistakes
even in determining who has committed a single criminal act and the problem
you have a mind that can understand this fully adam when you are calm dont suppose i cant enter into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred but
for it is passion and you deceive yourself in calling it justice it might be with you precisely as it has been with arthur nay worse your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime
no not worse said adam bitterly i dont believe its worse id sooner do it id sooner do a wickedness as i could suffer for by myself than ha brought her to do wickedness
and then stand by and see em punish her while they let me alone and all for a bit o pleasure as if hed had a mans heart in him hed ha cut his hand off sooner than hed ha taken it what if he didnt foresee whats happened
he foresaw enough hed no right to expect anything but harm and shame to her
not half so hateful as that let a man do what he will if he knows hes to bear the punishment himself
and knows all the while the punishment ll fall on somebody else there again you partly deceive yourself adam there is no sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone you cant isolate yourself
i feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of arthurs has caused to others but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it an act of vengeance on your part against arthur would simply be another evil
added to those we are suffering under you could not bear the punishment alone you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you you would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were
as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on arthurs punishment is revenge and not justice you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong remember what you told me about your feelings
after you had given that blow to arthur in the grove adam was silent the last words had called up a vivid image of the past and mister irwine left him to his thoughts
while he spoke to bartle massey about old mister donnithornes funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind but at length adam turned round and said in a more subdued tone
is dinah morris come to em sir seth said theyd sent for her no mister poyser tells me she was not come when he left theyre afraid the letter has not reached her
it seems they had no exact address adam sat ruminating a little while and then said
but perhaps the poysers
since they wont come nigh her themselves but i think she would for the methodists are great folks for going into the prisons and seth said he thought she would shed a very tender way with her dinah had
you never saw her sir did you yes i did i had a conversation with her she pleased me a good deal and now you mention it i wish she would come for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her
if id thought of it earlier i would have taken some measures for finding her out said mister irwine but its too late now i fear well adam i must go now try to get some rest to night
nearly a year went by lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continent that refuge for such fugitives now moving about from place to place with her companion now stationary and alone quite half the time
taking one absence with the other he had been away from her chiefly in paris pursuing his own course and his own pleasure how fared it with lady isabel just as it must be expected to fare and does fare
when a high principled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal never had she experienced a moments calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion
when instead of the garden of roses it had been her persuaders pleasure to promise her she would fall into but which in truth she had barely glanced at for that had not been her moving motive
she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror from which there was never more any escape never more never more the very instant the very night of her departure she awoke to what she had done the guilt
whose aspect had been shunned in the prospective assumed at once its true frightful color the blackness of darkness and a lively remorse a never dying anguish took possession of her soul forever oh reader believe me
lady wife mother should you ever be tempted to abandon your home so will you awake whatever trials may be the lot of your married life though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature
the endurance of woman to bear resolve to bear them fall down upon your knees and pray to be enabled to bear them pray for patience pray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape bear unto death
rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience for be assured that the alternative if you do rush on to it will be found worse than death poor thing poor lady isabel she had sacrificed husband children
reputation home all that makes life of value to woman she had forfeited her duty to god had deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison
but the instant the step was irrevocable the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance set in even in the first days of her departure in the fleeting moments of abandonment when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience
it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings and she knew that her whole future existence whether spent with that man or without him would be a dark course of gnawing retribution nearly a year went by save some six or eight weeks
furnished in the vicinity of the place grenette a windy old house it was full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards and he said he should remain there lady isabel remonstrated
she wished to go farther on where they might get quicker news from england but her will now was as nothing she was looking like the ghost of her former self talk of her having looked ill when she took that voyage over the water with mister carlyle you should have seen her now
misery marks the countenance worse than sickness her face was white and worn her hands were thin her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circle care was digging caves for them
a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health she knew better knew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart it was very late for breakfast but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day
languidly she took her seat at the table just as captain levisons servant a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris entered the room with two letters point de gazette pierre
and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket but he was only obeying the orders of his master it had been captain levisons recent pleasure that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel until he had over looked them
you will speedily gather his motive pierre departed toward captain levisons room and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest it was known to her that mister carlyle had not lost a moment
in seeking a divorce and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected she was anxious for it anxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child
little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself
the decked out dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slovens in domestic privacy he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy and she as apathetically answered to it pierre says there are some letters he began
last out a whole ten months you are in egregious error compliments the very opposite to honey and sweetness have generally supervened long before try it if you dont believe me two letters she continued
and they are both in the same handwriting your solicitors i believe up went his hand at the last word and he made a sort of grab at the letters stalked to the farthest window opened it and glanced over its contents sir
we beg to inform you that the suit carlyle vs carlyle is at an end the divorce was pronounced without opposition according to your request we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact we are sir faithfully yours moss and grab
it was over then and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket is there any news she asked
news of the divorce i mean tush was the response of captain levison as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a far off affair
sir after sending off our last dated to day we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison your grand uncle he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice
we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession to the title and estates and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you
on your favoring us with instructions and we remain sir most faithfully yours moss and grab sir francis levison bart the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other f levison esquire
at last thank the pigs was the gentlemans euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfast table the divorce is granted feverishly uttered lady isabel he made no reply but seated himself to breakfast
you may drop that odious title isabel which has stuck to me too long i own a better now what one pray you can look and see lady isabel took up the letter and read it sir francis swallowed down his coffee and rang the
table hand bell the only bell you generally meet with in france pierre answered it put me up a change of things said he in french i start for england in an hour it is very well pierre responded and departed to do it
lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks you do not mean what you say you will not leave me yet i cannot do otherwise he answered theres a mountain of business to be attended to
besides i should not choose for the old mans funeral to take place without me
you might not be back in time in time for what oh how can you ask she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach you know too well in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear i shall chance it
coolly observed sir francis chance it chance the legitimacy of the child you must assure that before all things
now dont put yourself in a fever isabel how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you it does no good is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england have you no pity for your child she urged in agitation
nothing can repair the injury if you once suffer it to come upon him he will be a by word amidst men throughout his life you had better have written to the law lords to urge on the divorce he returned i cannot help the delay
there has been no delay quite the contrary but it may be expected hourly now you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time he quitted the room as he spoke and lady isabel remained in it the image of despair
nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed
where is pierre miladi asked
scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray when sir francis levison appeared equipped for traveling good bye isabel said he without further circumlocution or ceremony
lady isabel excited beyond all self control slipped the bolt of the door and half leaning against it half leaning at his feet held up her hand in supplication francis have you any consideration left for me any in the world
how can you be so alarmed isabel of course i have he continued in a peevish though kind tone as he took hold of her hands to raise her no not yet i will remain here until you say you will wait another day or two
you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive
you will wait i cannot wait he replied his tone changing to one of determination it is useless to urge it he broke from her and left the room and in another minute had left the house pierre attending him a feeling amounting to a conviction
and white and sleety and sloppy the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black and the people crept along especially dismal close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom
full of windows and doors and draughts with its wide hearth and its wide chimney into which we could put four or five of our english ones shivered lady isabel vane she had an invalid cap on and a thick woolen invalid shawl
and she shook and shivered perpetually though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs
she had had a long illness terminating in a low fever
that miladi would soon get about if she would only rouse herself she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it
had he come who is it she asked of the nurse miladi it is monsieur and pierre is with him i have begged milady often and often not to fret for monsieur would surely come miladi see i am right
the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him
in a subdued quiet tone not to draw too near as any little excitement made her faint now he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot as he explained that he really could not get away from town before
settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction to speak and act let there be plain truth between us at this interview if there never has been before i dont understand you naked truth unglossed over
she pursued bending her eyes determinately upon him it must be with all my heart returned sir francis it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind
when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage you know what i mean when i say in time but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise he interrupted but no sooner had i set my foot in london
than i found myself overwhelmed with business and away from it i could not get even now i can only remain with you a couple of days for i must hasten back to town you are breaking faith already she said after hearing him calmly to the end
your words are not words of truth but of deceit you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage
what fancies you do take up uttered francis levison some time subsequent to your departure she quietly went on one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressing closet and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets
i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished
he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an ill tempered man and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued
it would have been better to have undeceived me then to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain i did not judge so he replied the excited state you then appeared to be in
would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time
well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before
when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the childs inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed
and saw an infants cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words
and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day
and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony it would be futile the injury to the child can never be repaired and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you
if you have taken this aversion to me it cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation
she shook her head all the reparation in your power to make all the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever oh sin was the derisive exclamation
you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she sadly answered may heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as i was if you mean that as a reproach to me its rather out of place chafed sir francis
whose fits of ill temper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband
quite true was her reply and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabel if it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts
i do not understand what you would imply she said drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver how on the wrong scent with regard to your husband and that hare girl you were blindly outrageously jealous of him go on
and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mister carlyle ever thought of the girl in that way what do you mean she gasped they had a secret between them not of love a secret of business and those interviews they had together
her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the ill temper was upon him
and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i cant explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you
and carlyle was acting in it under the rose for missus hare she could not seek out carlyle herself so she sent the young lady thats all i know how did you know it i had reason to think so
what reason i must request you to tell me i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information you told a different tale to me sir francis was her remark
as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb
over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritance
was her icy answer lets see how old is he now he was born on the last day of august sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes
who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided
outwardly into calmness again what else retorted sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me
she made no reply sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child returned to the fire and stood a few moments with his back to it is my room prepared for me do you know he presently asked no it is not she quietly rejoined
these apartments are mine now they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation will you be so obliging i am not strong as to hand me that writing case sir francis walked to the table she indicated
which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writing case from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some bank notes
i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so
allow me to return them to you count them return them to me for what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them
if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable
remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sum we will fix upon the amount amicably
i beg of you to cease she passionately interrupted what do you take me for take you for why how can you live you have no fortune you must receive assistance from some one i will not receive it from you if the whole world denied me
sarcastically rejoined sir francis generous man a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake
if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her as if beating off the man and his words
whom do you take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pale of the world i am still lord mount severns daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as
dont i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it
resumed sir francis in a little time you may probably wish to recall it in which case a line addressed to me at my bankers will lady isabel drew herself up put away those notes if you please she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence
he took out his pocket book and placed the bank notes within it your clothes
you will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon and now sir francis i believe that is all we will part to remain mortal enemies from henceforth is that to be it to be strangers she replied correcting him
i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment
and calling the servants before him there were but two gave them each a years wages in advance
then he paid a visit to the landlord and handed him likewise a years rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again
sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks
into an adjoining room when lady isabel lay down to rest she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late also into a dream she thought she was back at east lynne not back in one sense
but that she seemed never to have gone away from it walking in the flower garden with mister carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husbands and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward
excepting that it was connected with the office and old mister dill and that mister carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke
alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke her this last child the ill fated little being in the cradle beside her
they had undergone a remarkable change since our arrival at the butchers shop they now wandered about fat sleek and contented and their former voracity had completely disappeared
as regards ourselves a day or two longer made no difference our most important article of diet the pemmican was practically left untouched as for the time being dog had completely taken its place
there was thus no great sign of depression to be noticed when we came back into the tent after finishing our work and had to while away the time as i went in i could descry wisting a little way off kneeling on the ground
and engaged in the manufacture of cutlets the dogs stood in a ring round him and looked on with interest the north east wind whistled and howled the air was thick with driving snow and wisting was not to be envied
to whatever age i may live in the course of the night the wind had gone back to the north and increased to a gale it was blowing and snowing so that when we came out in the morning we could not see the sledges they were half snowed under
the temperature was not so very low
we had all taken a turn outside to look at the weather and were sitting on our sleeping bags discussing the poor prospect its the devils own weather here at the butchers said one it looks to me as if it would never get any better
this is the fifth day and its blowing worse than ever we all agreed theres nothing so bad as lying weather bound like this continued another it takes more out of you than going from morning to night personally i was of the same opinion
one day may be pleasant enough but two three four
no it was awful shall we try it no sooner was the proposal submitted than it was accepted unanimously and with acclamation when i think of my four friends of the southern journey
it is the memory of that morning that comes first to my mind all the qualities that i most admire in a man were clearly shown at that juncture courage and dauntlessness without boasting or big words
amid joking and chaff everything was packed and then out into the blizzard it was practically impossible to keep ones eyes open the fine drift snow penetrated everywhere
the dogs were not much inclined to start and it took time to get them into their harness but at last we were ready one more glance over the camping ground to see that nothing we ought to have with us had been forgotten
which we now thought would not be required were left behind the last thing to be done was planting a broken ski upright by the side of the depot it was wisting who did this thinking presumably that an extra mark would do no harm
that it was a happy thought the future will show and then we were off it was a hard pull to begin with both for men and beasts as the high sastrugi continued towards the south
and made it extremely difficult to advance those who had sledges to drive had to be very attentive and support them so that they did not capsize on the big waves and we who had no sledges found great difficulty in keeping our feet
as we had nothing to lean against we went on like this slowly enough but the main thing was that we made progress the ground at first gave one the impression of rising though not much the going was extremely heavy
it was like dragging oneself through sand meanwhile the sastrugi grew smaller and smaller and finally they disappeared altogether and the surface became quite flat the going also improved by degrees
for what reason it is difficult to say as the storm continued unabated and the drift now combined with falling snow was thicker than ever it was all the driver could do to see his own dogs the surface
which had become perfectly level had the appearance at times of sinking in any case one would have thought so from the pace of the sledges now and again the dogs would set off suddenly at a gallop the wind aft no doubt helped the pace somewhat
but it alone could not account for the change i did not like this tendency of the ground to fall away in my opinion we ought to have done with anything of that sort after reaching the height at which we were a slight slope upward
possibly but down no that did not agree with my reckoning so far the incline had not been so great as to cause uneasiness but if it seriously began to go downhill we should have to stop and camp
would be madness we might risk falling into some chasm before we had time to pull up hanssen as usual was driving first strictly speaking i should now have been going in advance but the uneven surface at the start
and the rapid pace afterwards had made it impossible to walk as fast the dogs could pull i was therefore following by the side of wistings sledge and chatting with him suddenly i saw hanssens dogs shoot ahead
and downhill they went at the wildest pace wisting after them i shouted to hanssen to stop
by twisting his sledge the others who were following stopped when they came up to him we were in the middle of a fairly steep descent what there might be below was not easy to decide nor would we try to find out in that weather
we trampled down a place for the tent in the loose snow and soon got it up it was not a long days march that we had done eleven and three quarter miles but we had put an end to our stay at the butchers shop and that was a great thing
the boiling point test that evening showed that we were ten thousand three hundred feet above the sea and that we had thus gone down six hundred twenty feet from the butchers we turned in and went to sleep as soon as it brightened
one has to seize every opportunity in these regions if one neglects to do so it may mean a long wait and much may be lost we therefore all slept with one eye open
and we knew well that nothing could happen without our noticing it at three in the morning the sun cut through the clouds and we through the tent door to take in the situation was more than the work of a moment
the sun showed as yet like a pat of butter and had not succeeded in dispersing the thick mists the wind had dropped somewhat but was still fairly strong this is after all the worst part of ones job
turning out of ones good warm sleeping bag and standing outside for some time in thin clothes watching the weather we knew by experience that a gleam like this a clearing in the weather might come suddenly and then one had to be on the spot
the gleam came it did not last long but long enough we lay on the side of a ridge that fell away pretty steeply the descent on the south was too abrupt but on the south east it was better and more gradual
and ended in a wide level tract we could see no crevasses or unpleasantness of any kind it was not very far that we could see though only our nearest surroundings of the mountains we saw nothing
had now broken loose again and the north easter was doing all it could
since we had discovered the nature of our immediate surroundings if we once got down to the plain we knew that we could always feel our way on after putting ample brakes on the sledge runners
we started off downhill in a south easterly direction the slight idea of the position that we had been able to get in the morning proved correct the descent was easy and smooth and we reached the plain without any adventure
we could now once more set our faces to the south and in thick driving snow we continued our way into the unknown with good assistance from the howling north easterly gale we now recommenced the erection of beacons
which had not been necessary during the ascent
the last of them that we encountered the surface was now fine enough smooth as a floor and without a sign of sastrugi if our progress was nevertheless slow and difficult this was due to the wretched going
which was real torture to all of us a sledge journey through the sahara could not have offered a worse surface to move over
the weather improved in the course of the day and when we camped in the afternoon it looked quite smiling the sun came through and gave a delightful warmth after the last few bitter days it was not yet clear
so that we could see nothing of our surroundings the distance according to our three sledge meters was eighteen and a half miles taking the bad going into consideration we had reason to be well satisfied with it
our altitude came out at nine thousand four hundred seventy five feet above the sea or a drop of eight hundred twenty five feet in the course of the day this surprised me greatly what did it mean
instead of rising gradually we were going slowly down
but what according to dead reckoning our latitude that evening
the night was filled with sharp gusts from the north the morning came with a slack wind but accompanied by mist and snowfall this was abominable here we were advancing over absolutely virgin ground and able to see nothing
the surface remained about the same possibly rather more undulating that it had been blowing here at some time and violently too was shown by the under surface which was composed of sastrugi as hard as iron
luckily for us the snowfall of the last few days had filled these up so as to present a level surface it was heavy going though better than on the previous day as we were advancing still blindly
and fretting at the persistently thick weather one of us suddenly called out hullo look there a wild dark summit rose high out of the mass of fog to the east south east it was not far away
on the contrary it seemed threateningly near and right over us we stopped and looked at the imposing sight but nature did not expose her objects of interest for long the fog rolled over again thick heavy and dark
and blotted out the view we knew now that we had to be prepared for surprises after we had gone about ten miles the fog again lifted for a moment and we saw quite near a mile or so away
two long narrow mountain ridges to the west of us running north and south and completely covered with snow these
they were between nine thousand and ten thousand feet high and would probably serve as excellent landmarks on the return journey there was no connection to be traced between these mountains and those lying to the east of them
they gave us the impression of being entirely isolated summits as we could not make out any lofty ridge running east and west
we continued our course in the constant expectation of finding some surprise or other in our line of route the air ahead of us was as black as pitch as though it concealed something
it could not be a storm or it would have been already upon us but we went on and on and nothing came our days march was eighteen and a half miles i see that my diary for november twenty eighth
does not begin very promisingly fog fog and again fog also fine falling snow which makes the going impossible poor beasts they have toiled hard to get the sledges forward to day
but the day did not turn out so badly after all as we worked our way out of this uncertainty and found out what was behind the pitch dark clouds during the forenoon the sun came through and thrust aside the fog for a while and there
to the south east not many miles away lay an immense mountain mass from this mass right across our course ran a great ancient glacier the sun shone down upon it and showed us a surface full of huge irregularities
on the side nearest to the mountain these disturbances were such that a hasty glance was enough to show us the impossibility of advancing that way but right in our line of route straight on to the glacier
and waited for decently clear weather so that we might survey the ground at our ease and choose the best way going forward without an idea of what the ground was like was not very pleasant
but how long should we have to wait for clear weather that question was unanswerable possibly a week or even a fortnight and we had no time for that better go straight on then and take what might come
what we could see of the glacier appeared to be pretty steep but it was only between the south and south east under the new land that the fog now and again lifted sufficiently to enable us to see anything
we could see that the big crevasses lost themselves in it and the question of what the glacier looked like on the west
it was plain enough that we should have stiff work it was therefore important to have as little as possible on the sledges we set to work at once to build the depot the snow here was excellent for this purpose
as hard as glass in a short time an immense erection of adamantine blocks of snow rose into the air containing provisions for five men for six days and for eighteen dogs for five days
a number of small articles were also left behind while we were thus occupied the fog had been coming and going some of the intervals had been quite clear and had given me a good view of the nearest part of the range
it appeared to be quite isolated and to consist of four mountains one of these mount helmer hanssen lay separated from the rest the other three mounts oscar wisting
and olav bjaaland lay closer together behind this group the air had been heavy and black the whole time showing that more land must be concealed there suddenly
and the summits of a colossal mountain mass appeared our first impression was that this mountain mount thorvald nilsen must be something over twenty thousand feet high it positively took our breath away
so formidable did it appear but it was only a glimpse that we had and then the fog enclosed it once more we had succeeded in taking a few meagre bearings of the different summits of the nearest group
they were not very grand but better ones were not to be obtained for that matter the site of the depot was so well marked by its position under the foot of the glacier that we agreed it would be impossible to miss it
having finished the edifice which rose at least six feet into the air
so as to be able to see it still more easily on the way back an observation we had contrived to take while the work was in progress
this did not agree very well with the latitude of our dead reckoning
and a fine light snow was falling we had taken a bearing of the line of glacier that was most free of crevasses and so we moved on again
the crevasses at its foot were not large but we had no sooner entered upon the ascent than the fun began there was something uncanny about this perfectly blind advance among crevasses and chasms on all sides
we examined the compass from time to time and went forward cautiously
but that after all was not much of a help to our drivers
as the crevasses were often rendered quite invisible by a thin overlying layer of snow
to have to cross such a surface as the effect of light and shade is usually to show up the edges of these insidious pitfalls but on a day like this when everything looked alike ones advance is doubtful we kept it going however
by using the utmost caution wisting came near to sounding the depth of one of these dangerous crevasses with sledge dogs and all as the bridge he was about to cross gave way thanks to his presence of mind
and a lightning like movement some would call it luck he managed to save himself in this way we worked up about two hundred feet but then we came upon such a labyrinth of yawning chasms and open abysses
that we could not move there was nothing to be done but to find the least disturbed spot and set the tent there as soon as this was done hanssen and i set out to explore we were roped and therefore safe enough
it required some study to find a way out of the trap we had run ourselves into towards the group of mountains last described which now lay to the east of us
in all directions and evoked a picture of violent confusion thank god we were not here while this was going on i thought to myself as i stood looking out over this battlefield it must have been a spectacle like doomsday
and not on a small scale either to advance in that direction then was hopeless but that was no great matter since our way was to the south on the south we could see nothing the fog lay thick and heavy there
this ridge led us on to an icewave about twenty five feet high a formation which was due to the pressure having ceased before the wave had been forced to break and form hummocks
we saw well enough that this would be a difficult place to pass with sledges and dogs but in default of anything better it would have to be done from the top of this wave formation we could see down on the other side
which had hitherto been hidden from us the fog prevented our seeing far but the immediate surroundings were enough to convince us that with caution we could beat up farther from the height on which we stood
as we saw absolutely nothing our object was to make tracks for the following days journey the language we used about the glacier as we went was not altogether complimentary we had endless tacking and turning to get on
a fissure had opened making a gateway about six feet wide this formation like every thing else on the glacier was obviously very old and for the most part filled with snow
from this point the glacier as far as our view extended to the south looked better and better
our companions were no less pleased with the news we brought of our prospects our altitude that evening was eight thousand six hundred fifty feet above the sea that is to say at the foot of the glacier
we had reached an altitude of eight thousand four hundred fifty feet or a drop from the butchers of two thousand five hundred seventy feet we now knew very well that we should have this ascent to make again perhaps even more
and this idea did not arouse any particular enthusiasm in my diary i see that i conclude the day with the following words what will the next surprise be i wonder it was in fact
an extraordinary journey that we were undertaking through new regions new mountains glaciers and so on without being able to see
what i liked least about this feeling ones way forward in the dark was that it would be difficult very difficult indeed to recognize the ground again on the way back but with this glacier lying straight across our line of route
a mistake there might be serious enough and it will appear later in this narrative that my fear of our not being able to recognize the way was not entirely groundless the beacons we had put up came to our aid
and for our final success we owe a deep debt of gratitude to our prudence and thoughtfulness in adopting this expedient next morning november twenty ninth brought considerably clearer weather
and allowed us a very good survey of our position we could now see that the two mountain ranges
with summits from ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet mount thorvald nilsen was the most southerly we could see from this point mounts hanssen wisting bjaaland and hassel formed as we had thought the day before
a group by themselves and lay separated from the main range the drivers had a warm mornings work they had to drive with great circumspection and patience to grapple with the kind of ground we had before us
a slight mistake might be enough to send both sledge and dogs with lightning rapidity into the next world it took nevertheless a remarkably short time to cover the distance we had explored on the previous evening before we knew it
we were at hells gate bjaaland took an excellent photograph here which gives a very good idea of the difficulties this part of the journey presented in the foreground
below the high snow ridge that forms one side of a very wide but partly filled up crevasse the marks of ski can be seen in the snow this was the photographer who in passing over this snow bridge
struck his ski into it to try the strength of the support close to the tracks can be seen an open piece of the crevasse it is a pale blue at the top but ends in the deepest black in a bottomless abyss
the photographer got over the bridge and back with a whole skin but there could be no question of risking sledges and dogs on it and it can be seen in the photograph that the sledges have been turned right round to try another way
but taking into account all the turns and circuits we had been compelled to make it was not so short after all we set our tent on a good solid foundation and were well pleased with the days work
the altitude was eight thousand nine hundred sixty feet above the sea the sun was now in the west and shining directly upon the huge mountain masses it was a fairy landscape in blue and white
clear as it now appeared to be one could understand that the weather was not all that could be wished for the south eastern end of mount thorvald nilsen lost itself in a dark impenetrable cloud
which led one to suspect a continuation in that direction though one could not be certain mount nilsen ah anything more beautiful taking it altogether i have never seen
peaks of the most varied forms rose high into the air partly covered with driving clouds some were sharp but most were long and rounded here and there one saw bright shining glaciers
plunging wildly down the steep sides and merging into the underlying ground in fearful confusion but the most remarkable of them all was mount helmer hanssen its top was as round as the bottom of a bowl
and covered by an extraordinary ice sheet which was so broken up and disturbed that the blocks of ice bristled in every direction like the quills of a porcupine it glittered and burned in the sunlight a glorious spectacle
none of us whether children or adults needs an introduction to mother goose those things which are earliest impressed upon our minds cling to them most tenaciously the snatches sung in the nursery are never forgotten
nor are they ever recalled without bringing back with them myriads of slumbering feelings and half forgotten images we hear the sweet low voice of the mother singing soft lullabies to her darling
and see the kindly wrinkled face of the grandmother as she croons the old ditties to quiet our restless spirits one generation is linked to another by the everlasting spirit of song
the ballads of the nursery follow us from childhood to old age and they are readily brought from memorys recesses at any time to amuse our children or our grandchildren the collection of jingles we know and love as the melodies of mother goose
are evidently drawn from a variety of sources while they are taken altogether a happy union of rhyme wit
the research after the author of each individual verse would indeed be hopeless it would be folly to suppose them all the composition of uneducated old nurses for many of them contain much reflection wit and melody
it is said that shelley wrote pussy cat mew and dean swift little bo peep and these assertions are as difficult to disprove as to prove some of the older verses however
are doubtless offshoots from ancient folk lore songs and have descended to us through many centuries the connection of mother goose with the rhymes which bear her name is difficult to determine and in fact three countries claim her for their own
france england and america about the year sixteen fifty there appeared in circulation in london a small book named rhymes of the nursery or lulla byes for children
which contained many of the identical pieces that have been handed down to us but the name of mother goose was evidently not then known in this edition were the rhymes of little jack homer old king cole mistress mary sing a song o sixpence
and little boy blue in sixteen ninety seven charles perrault published in france
although perraults tales differ materially from those we now know under this title they comprised the sleeping beauty the fairy little red riding hood blue beard puss in boots
riquet with the tuft cinderella and little thumb eight stories in all on the cover of the book was depicted an old lady holding in her hand a distaff
america bases her claim to mother goose upon the following statement made by the late john fleet eliot a descendant of thomas fleet the printer at the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived in boston a lady named eliza goose
written also vergoose and vertigoose who belonged to a wealthy family her eldest daughter elizabeth goose or vertigoose
and in due time gave birth to a son like most mothers in law in our day the importance of missus goose increased with the appearance of her grandchild and poor mister fleet half distracted with her endless nursery ditties finding all other means fail
tried what ridicule could effect and actually printed a book under the title songs of the nursery or mother gooses melodies for children on the title page was the picture of a goose with a very long neck and a mouth wide open and below this
printed by t fleet at his printing house in pudding lane seventeen nineteen price two coppers mister wm a wheeler the editor of hurd and houghtons elaborate edition of mother goose eighteen seventy reiterated this assertion
and a writer in the boston transcript of june seventeenth eighteen sixty four says fleets book was partly a reprint of an english collection of songs barclays and the new title was doubtless a compliment by the printer to his mother in law goose for her contributions
she was the mother of sixteen children and a typical old woman who lived in a shoe we may take it to be true that fleets wife was of the vergoose family and that the name was often contracted to goose
but the rest of the story is unsupported by any evidence whatever in fact all that mister eliot knew of it was the statement of the late edward a crowninshield of boston that he had seen fleets edition in the library of the american antiquarian society
repeated researches at worcester having failed to bring to light this supposed copy and no record of it appearing on any catalogue there we may dismiss the entire story with the supposition that mister eliot misunderstood the remarks made to him
indeed as mister william h whitmore points out in his clever monograph upon mother goose albany eighteen eighty nine it is very doubtful whether in seventeen nineteen
boston children at that date says mister whitmore were fed upon gospel food and it seems extremely improbable that an edition could have been sold
is of about the same date as bostons there lived in a town in sussex about the year seventeen o four an old woman named martha gooch she was a capital nurse and in great demand to care for newly born babies therefore
through long years of service as nurse she came to be called mother gooch this good woman had one peculiarity she was accustomed to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges and these rhymes
seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them that they began to call her mother goose in derision the term being derived from queen goosefoot the mother of charlemagne the old nurse paid no attention to her critics
but continued to sing her rhymes as before for however much grown people might laugh at her the children seemed to enjoy them very much and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses
at one time mistress gooch was nursing a child of mister ronald barclay a physician residing in the town and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them in time he wrote them all down and made a book of them
which it is said was printed by john worthington and son in the strand london in seventeen twelve under the name of ye melodious rhymes of mother goose but even this story of martha gooch
is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence the earliest english edition of mother gooses melodies that is absolutely authentic was issued by john newbury of london about the year seventeen sixty and the first authentic american edition
in seventeen eighty five none of the earlier editions however contained all the rhymes so well known at the present day since every decade has added its quota to the mass of jingles attributed to mother goose
some of the earlier verses have become entirely obsolete and it is well they have for many were crude and silly and others were coarse it is simply a result of the greater refinement of modern civilization
that they have been relegated to oblivion while the real gems of the collection will doubtless live and grow in popular favor for many ages
it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth or a living eliza goose martha gooch or the mere oye of perrault the songs that cluster around her name are what we love
and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does mother goose herself many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves telling their story tersely but completely there are others which are but bare suggestions
leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story perhaps therein may lie part of their charm but however that may be i have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines
for that reason i have written this book in making the stories i have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes and my hope is that the little ones will like them and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations

and one of these flocks used to be cared for by a poor woman who supported herself and her little girl by this means they lived in a small cottage nestled at the foot of one of the hills and each morning the mother took her crook
and started out with her sheep that they might feed upon the tender juicy grasses with which the hills abounded the little girl usually accompanied her mother and sat by her side
upon the grassy mounds and watched her care for the ewes and lambs so that in time she herself grew to be a very proficient shepherdess so when the mother became too old and feeble to leave her cottage little bo peep as she was called
decided that she was fully able to manage the flocks herself she was a little mite of a child with flowing nut brown locks and big gray eyes that charmed all who gazed into their innocent depths she wore a light gray frock
fastened about the waist with a pretty pink sash and there were white ruffles around her neck and pink ribbons in her hair all the shepherds and shepherdesses upon the hills both young and old soon came to know little bo peep very well indeed
and there were many willing hands to aid her if which was not often she needed their assistance bo peep usually took her sheep to the side of a high hill above the cottage and allowed them to eat the rich grass while she herself sat upon a mound and
laying aside her crook and her broad straw hat with its pink ribbons devoted her time to sewing and mending stockings for her aged mother one day while thus occupied
good morning little bo peep and looking up the girl saw a woman standing near her and leaning upon a short stick she was bent nearly double by weight of many years her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals
deep wrinkles seamed her face and hands while her nose and chin were so pointed that they nearly met she was not pleasant to look upon but bo peep had learned to be polite to the aged so she answered sweetly
good morning mother can i do anything for you no dearie returned the woman in a cracked voice but i will sit by your side and rest for a time the girl made room on the mound beside her
and the stranger sat down and watched in silence the busy fingers sew up the seams of the new frock she was making by and by the woman asked why do you come out here to sew because i am a shepherdess replied the girl
but where is your crook on the grass beside me and where are your sheep bo peep looked up and could not see them they must have strayed over the top of the hill she said and i will go and seek them
do not be in a hurry croaked the old woman they will return presently without your troubling to find them do you think so asked bo peep of course do not the sheep know you
oh yes they know me every one and do not you know the sheep i can call every one by name said bo peep confidently for though i am so young a shepherdess i am fond of my sheep and know all about them
the old woman chuckled softly as if the answer amused her and replied no one knows all about anything my dear but i know all about my sheep protested little bo peep do you indeed
then you are wiser that most people and if you know all about them you also know they will come home of their own accord and i have no doubt they will all be wagging their tails behind them as usual
oh said little bo peep in surprise do they wag their tails i never noticed that indeed exclaimed the old woman then you are not very observing for one who knows all about sheep
perhaps you have never noticed their tails at all no answered bo peep thoughtfully i do nt know that i ever have the woman laughed so hard at this reply
that she began to cough and this made the girl remember that her flock had strayed away i really must go and find my sheep she said rising to her feet and then i shall be sure to notice their tails and see if they wag them sit still my child
said the old woman i am going over the hill top myself and i will send the sheep back to you so she got upon her feet and began climbing the hill and the girl heard her saying as she walked away little bo peep has lost her sheep
and does nt know where to find em but leave em alone and they ll come home all wagging their tails behind em little bo peep sat still and watched the old woman toil slowly up the hill side and disappear over the top by and by she thought
very soon i shall see the sheep coming back but time passed away and still the errant flock failed to make its appearance soon the head of the little shepherdess began to nod
little bo peep fell fast asleep and dreamt she heard them bleating but when she awoke she found it a joke for still they were a fleeting the girl now became quite anxious and wondered why the old woman had not driven her flock over the hill
but as it was now time for luncheon she opened her little basket and ate of the bread and cheese and cookies she had brought with her after she had finished her meal and taken a drink of cool water from a spring near by
she decided she would not wait any longer so up she took her little crook determined for to find them and began climbing the hill when she got to the top there was never a sight of sheep about
only a green valley and another hill beyond now really alarmed for the safety of her charge bo peep hurried into the valley and up the farther hill side panting and tired she reached the summit and pausing breathlessly
gazed below her quietly feeding upon the rich grass was her truant flock looking as peaceful and innocent as if it had never strayed away from its gentle shepherdess bo peep uttered a cry of joy and hurried toward them
but when she came near she stopped in amazement and held up her little hands with a pretty expression of dismay she had found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
nothing was left to each sheep but a wee little stump where a tail should be and little bo peep was so heart broken that she sat down beside them and sobbed bitterly
but after awhile the tiny maid realized that all her tears would not bring back the tails to her lambkins so she plucked up courage and dried her eyes and arose from the ground just as the old woman hobbled up to her
so you have found your sheep dearie she said in her cracked voice yes replied little bo peep with difficulty repressing a sob but look mother they ve all left their tails behind them why so they have exclaimed the old woman
and then she began to laugh as if something pleased her what do you suppose has become of their tails asked the girl oh some one has probably cut them off they make nice tippets in winter time you know
and then she patted the child upon her head and walked away down the valley bo peep was much grieved over the loss that had befallen her dear sheep and so driving them before her she wandered around to see if by any chance she could find the lost tails
but soon the sun began to sink over the hill tops and she knew she must take her sheep home before night overtook them she did not tell her mother of her misfortune for she feared the old shepherdess would scold her
and bo peep had fully decided to seek for the tails and find them before she related the story of their loss to anyone each day for many days after that little bo peep wandered about the hills seeking the tails of her sheep
and those who met her wondered what had happened to make the sweet little maid so anxious but there is an end to all troubles no matter how severe they may seem to be and it happened one day as bo peep did stray unto a meadow hard by
the little shepherdess was overjoyed at this discovery and reaching up her crook she knocked the row of pretty white tails off the tree and gathered them up in her frock but how to fasten them onto her sheep again was the question
and after pondering the matter for a time she became discouraged and thinking she was no better off than before the tails were found she began to weep and to bewail her misfortune but amidst her tears she bethought herself of her needle and thread
why she exclaimed smiling again i can sew them on of course then she heaved a sigh and wiped her eye and ran oer hill and dale oh and tried what she could as a shepherdess should to tack to each sheep its tail oh
but the very first sheep she came to refused to allow her to sew on the tail and ran away from her and the others did the same so that finally she was utterly discouraged she was beginning to cry again when the same old woman she had before met
came hobbling to her side and asked what are you doing with my cat tails your cat tails replied bo peep in surprise what do you mean why these tails are all cut from white pussycats and i put them on the tree to dry
what are you doing with them i thought they belonged to my sheep answered bo peep sorrowfully
i must hunt until i find those that belong to my sheep my dear said the old woman i have been deceiving you you said you knew all about your sheep and i wanted to teach you a lesson for however wise we may be
no one in this world knows all about anything sheep do not have long tails there is only a little stump to answer for a tail neither do rabbits have tails nor bears nor many other animals
and if you had been observing you would have known all this when i said the sheep would be wagging their tails behind them and then you would not have passed all those days in searching for what is not to be found
so now little one run away home and try to be more thoughtful in the future your sheep will never miss the tails
and now little bo peep no more did weep my tale of tails ends here
the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was glowing
a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre
behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder and curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering clapping and shouting that died away and began again and rose to a thunderous pitch
and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some explanation he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly
he grasped the arm of this shouting person tell me he cried who am i who am i the others came nearer to hear his words
his eyes searched their faces they have told him nothing cried the girl tell me tell me cried graham you are the master of the earth you are owner of the world
he did not believe he heard aright he resisted the persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear he lifted his voice again i have been awake three days a prisoner three days
it is london yes said the younger man and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas how does it concern me
councillors under the atlas why should they try to drug me to keep you insensible said the man in yellow to prevent your interference
because you are the atlas sire said the man in yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it in your name the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly trampling on these last words came a deafening tumult a roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
the people in the little room could not hear each other shout graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard the council he repeated blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck him
but who is ostrog he said
our leader in your name in my name
why is he not here he has deputed us i am his brother his half brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him that is why he has sent
he is at the wind vane offices directing the people are marching in your name shouted the younger man they have ruled crushed tyrannised at last even in my name my name master
the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder
no one expected you to wake they were cunning damned tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did not know whether to drug you hypnotise you kill you again the hall dominated everything ostrog is at the wind vane offices ready
even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our organisations ready we shall seize the flying stages
even now he may be doing that then this public theatre bawled the man in yellow is only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled men we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a leader
massed in the inaudible it is now or never the council is rocking they cannot trust even their drilled men hear the people calling to you grahams mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds
now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented an antagonism
on the one hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
monstrous crowds packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name hailing him master the other side had imprisoned him debated his death these shouting thousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him
but why these things should be so he could not understand the door opened lincolns voice was swept away and drowned and a rash of people followed on the heels of the tumult these intruders came towards him
and lincoln gesticulating the voices without explained their soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were bawling for order silence
a waving incessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and women together waving pale blue garments extended hands many were standing one man in rags of dark brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a black cloth
he met the wonder and expectation of the girls eyes what did these people expect from him he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed its character was in some way beating marching his own mind too changed
but a moment that was near to panic passed he tried to make audible inquiries of
lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was deafened to that all the others save the woman gesticulated towards the hall he perceived what had happened to the uproar the whole mass of people was chanting together it was not simply a song
the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumental music music like the music of an organ
full of flaunting banners full of the march and pageantry of opening war and the feet of the people were beating time tramp tramp he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanically
the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred him emboldened him the hall opened to him
wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your arm to them this said a voice on the other side he must have this arms were about his neck detaining him in the doorway and a black subtly folding mantle hung from his shoulders
he threw his arm free of this and followed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant she became to him flushed and eager as she was an embodiment of the song
he emerged in the alcove again incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting guided by lincolns hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people
the hall was a vast and intricate space galleries balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and great archways far away high up seemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity
the whole multitude was swaying in congested masses individual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him momentarily and lost definition again close to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by three men
her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of toothless mouth a voice called
ostrog all his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song the multitude were beating time with their feet marking time tramp tramp tramp tramp the green weapons waved
flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him passing towards a great archway shouting to the council tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised his arm and the roaring was redoubled
march his mouth shaped inaudible heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to the archway shouting onward they were no longer marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp tramp in that host
were bearded men old men youths fluttering robed bare armed women girls men and women of the new age rich robes grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movement amidst the dominant blue
a monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right he perceived a blue clad negro a shrivelled woman in yellow then a group of tall fair haired white faced blue clad men pushed theatrically past him he noted two chinamen
a tall sallow dark haired shining eyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those marching cadences faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there eyes met his and passed and vanished men gesticulated to him shouted inaudible personal things
most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly white and disease was there and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of the new age strange and incredible meeting as the broad stream passed before him to the right
tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and passages men and women
mingled in the ranks tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was tramping the garments waved onward the faces poured by more abundantly tramp tramp tramp tramp
at lincolns pressure he turned towards the archway walking unconsciously in that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and song all moved in that direction
the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were below the level of his feet he was aware of a path before him of a suite about him of guards and dignities and lincoln on his right hand
attendants intervened and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left before him went the backs of the guards in black three and three and three he was marched along a little railed way and crossed above the archway
with the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up to him he did not know whither he went he did not want to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness of hall
chapter twenty one the under side from the business quarter they presently passed by the running ways into a remote quarter of the city where the bulk of the manufactures was done
on their way the platforms crossed the thames twice and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the north in both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights a string of black barges passed seaward manned by blue clad men
the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel along which big wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labour department was in abundance the smoothness of the double tracks
struck graham most vividly one lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
and blotted out the picture presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so came to a descending lift again the appearance of things changed even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared
the lights diminished in number and size the architecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached and in the dusty biscuit making place of the potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of the metal workers
the blue canvas clothing was on man woman and child many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation
but wherever there was work it was being done by slow moving workers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work places and the orange clad labour police and fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls
the voluntary vigours of the business quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter day workers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen
who were directing their labours the burly labourers of the old victorian times had followed that dray horse and all such living force producers to extinction the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine
the latter day labourer male as well as female was essentially a machine minder and feeder a servant and attendant or an artist under direction the women in comparison with those graham remembered
were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested two hundred years of emancipation from the moral restraints of puritanical religion two hundred years of city life had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads
to be brilliant physically or mentally to be in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line of escape to the pleasure city and its splendours and delights and at last
to the euthanasy and peace to be steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities of grahams former life the newly aggregated labouring mass
had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a high morality now it was differentiating into an instinct class with a moral and physical difference of its own even with a dialect of its own
they penetrated downward ever downward towards the working places presently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead and chinks of white lights between the transverse slits
the factories that were not working were sparsely lighted to graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was going on the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways
he came to the warren of the jewellers and with some difficulty and by using his signature obtained admission to these galleries they were high and dark and rather cold in the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree
each man at a little bench by himself and with a little shaded light the long vista of light patches with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the face of a ghost in each shadow
had the oddest effect the work was beautifully executed
for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this on coming to work but at night
in spite of every precaution the labour policeman told them in a depressed tone the department was not infrequently robbed beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificial ruby
many of these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion asano apologised to graham for this offensive sight but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route
this is what i wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement she might have done better with herself than that said asano
graham made some indignant comments but sire we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple said asano in your days people could stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by two hundred years
and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he had seen three barges smothered in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar
by a multitude of coughing men each guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white washed wall
every now and then one would stop to cough a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water brought to grahams mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky
their feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro and as he looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing stop that shouted one of the policemen but the order was disobeyed
and first one and then all the white stained men who were working there had taken up the beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp
the policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort to stop the singing and so they went through these factories and places of toil seeing many painful and grim things
that walk left on grahams mind a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of intricate machines the racing threads of looms the heavy beat of stamping machinery
the roar and rattle of belt and armature of ill lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin point lights here was the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery
and here unprecedented reeks everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world
even as these anemic millions were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation once and again and again a third time
graham heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant research in these places and once he saw a confused struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of these serfs had seized their bread before their work was done graham was ascending towards the ways again
when he saw a number of blue clad children running down a transverse passage and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of the labour police armed with clubs trotting towards some unknown disturbance and then came a remote disorder
but for the most part this remnant that worked worked hopelessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in the streets that night calling for the master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms
they emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of the middle passage of the platforms again they became aware of the remote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelligence offices
then a woman with a face of mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked as she ran what has happened now said graham puzzled for he could not understand their thick speech then he heard it in english and perceived that the thing that everyone was shouting
that men yelled to one another that women took up screaming that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police to london the black police are coming from south africa the black police the black police
he hesitated looked at grahams face and told him the thing he already knew but how can they know asked asano graham heard someone shouting stop all work stop all work
and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms toward him bawling again and again in good english this is ostrogs doing ostrog the knave the master is betrayed his voice was hoarse
he yelled an unspeakable horror that the black police had done in paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave for a moment graham stood still for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream
he looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting running people who were gesticulating past
the master is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent
he said i might have known the hour has come he thought swiftly what am i to do go back to the council house said asano why should i not appeal the people are here
you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but they will mass about the council house there you will find their leaders your strength is there with them suppose this is only a rumour
it sounds true said asano let us have the facts said graham
even now the ruins may be impassable graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one and there asano accosted a labourer the answers to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech what did he say asked graham
had not someone in the wind vane offices learnt he said a girl a girl not he said a girl he did not know who she was who came out from the council house crying aloud and told the men at work among the ruins
and then another thing was shouted something that turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements it came like a wind along the street
a certain king and queen had three daughters the charms of the two elder were more than common but the beauty of the youngest was so wonderful that the poverty of language is unable to express its due praise the fame of her beauty was so great
that strangers from neighboring countries came in crowds to enjoy the sight and looked on her with amazement paying her that homage which is due only to venus herself in fact venus found her altars deserted
while men turned their devotion to this young virgin as she passed along the people sang her praises and strewed her way with chaplets and flowers this perversion of homage due only to the immortal powers to the exaltation of a mortal
gave great offence to the real venus shaking her ambrosial locks with indignation she exclaimed am i then to be eclipsed in my honors by a mortal girl in vain then did that royal shepherd whose judgment was approved by jove himself
give me the palm of beauty over my illustrious rivals pallas and juno but she shall not so quietly usurp my honors i will give her cause to repent of so unlawful a beauty
mischievous enough in his own nature and rouses and provokes him yet more by her complaints she points out psyche to him and says my dear son punish that contumacious beauty give thy mother a revenge as sweet as her injuries are great
infuse into the bosom of that haughty girl a passion for some low mean unworthy being so that she may reap a mortification as great as her present exultation and triumph cupid prepared to obey the commands of his mother
there are two fountains in venuss garden one of sweet waters the other of bitter cupid filled two amber vases one from each fountain and suspending them from the top of his quiver hastened to the chamber of psyche whom he found asleep
he shed a few drops from the bitter fountain over her lips though the sight of her almost moved him to pity then touched her side with the point of his arrow at the touch she awoke and opened eyes upon cupid himself invisible
which so startled him that in his confusion he wounded himself with his own arrow heedless of his wound his whole thought now was to repair the mischief he had done and he poured the balmy drops of joy over all her silken ringlets
psyche henceforth frowned upon by venus derived no benefit from all her charms true all eyes were cast eagerly upon her and every mouth spoke her praises
her two elder sisters of moderate charms had now long been married to two royal princes but psyche in her lonely apartment deplored her solitude sick of that beauty which while it procured abundance of flattery had failed to awaken love
consulted the oracle of apollo and received this answer the virgin is destined for the bride of no mortal lover her future husband awaits her on the top of the mountain he is a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist
this dreadful decree of the oracle filled all the people with dismay and her parents abandoned themselves to grief but psyche said why my dear parents do you now lament me
you should rather have grieved when the people showered upon me undeserved honors and with one voice called me a venus i now perceive that i am a victim to that name i submit lead me to that rock to which my unhappy fate has destined me
accordingly all things being prepared the royal maid took her place in the procession which more resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp and with her parents amid the lamentations of the people ascended the mountain
on the summit of which they left her alone and with sorrowful hearts returned home while psyche stood on the ridge of the mountain panting with fear and with eyes full of tears the gentle zephyr raised her from the earth
and bore her with an easy motion into a flowery dale by degrees her mind became composed and she laid herself down on the grassy bank to sleep when she awoke
she entered it and in the midst discovered a fountain sending forth clear and crystal waters and fast by a magnificent palace whose august front impressed the spectator that it was not the work of mortal hands
but the happy retreat of some god drawn by admiration and wonder she approached the building and ventured to enter every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement golden pillars supported the vaulted roof
and the walls were enriched with carvings and paintings representing beasts of the chase and rural scenes adapted to delight the eye of the beholder proceeding onward she perceived that besides the apartments of state
there were others filled with all manner of treasures and beautiful and precious productions of nature and art while her eyes were thus occupied a voice addressed her though she saw no one uttering these words sovereign lady
retire therefore to your chamber and repose on your bed of down and when you see fit repair to the bath supper awaits you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to take your seat there psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants
and after repose and the refreshment of the bath seated herself in the alcove where a table immediately presented itself without any visible aid from waiters or servants and covered with the greatest delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines
her ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers of whom one sang another played on the lute and all closed in the wonderful harmony of a full chorus she had not yet seen her destined husband
but his accents were full of love and inspired a like passion in her she often begged him to stay and let her behold him but he would not consent on the contrary he charged her to make no attempt to see him
for it was his pleasure for the best of reasons to keep concealed why should you wish to behold me he said have you any doubt of my love have you any wish ungratified if you saw me perhaps you would fear me perhaps adore me
but all i ask of you is to love me i would rather you would love me as an equal than adore me as a god this reasoning somewhat quieted psyche for a time and while the novelty lasted she felt quite happy
but at length the thought of her parents left in ignorance of her fate
preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her palace as but a splendid prison when her husband came one night she told him her distress and at last drew from him an unwilling consent that her sisters should be brought to see her
so calling zephyr she acquainted him with her husbands commands and he promptly obedient soon brought them across the mountain down to their sisters valley they embraced her and she returned their caresses come said psyche
enter with me my house and refresh yourselves with whatever your sister has to offer then taking their hands she led them into her golden palace and committed them to the care of her numerous train of attendant voices to refresh them in her baths
and at her table and to show them all her treasures the view of these celestial delights caused envy to enter their bosoms at seeing their young sister possessed of such state and splendor so much exceeding their own
they asked her numberless questions among others what sort of a person her husband was psyche replied that he was a beautiful youth who generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the mountains the sisters not satisfied with this reply
soon made her confess that she had never seen him then they proceeded to fill her bosom with dark suspicions call to mind they said
the inhabitants of this valley say that your husband is a terrible and monstrous serpent who nourishes you for a while with dainties that he may by and by devour you take our advice provide yourself with a lamp and a sharp knife
put them in concealment that your husband may not discover them and when he is sound asleep slip out of bed bring forth your lamp and see for yourself whether what they say is true or not if it is hesitate not to cut off the monsters head and thereby recover your liberty
psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she could but they did not fail to have their effect on her mind and when her sisters were gone their words and her own curiosity were too strong for her to resist so she prepared her lamp
and a sharp knife and hid them out of sight of her husband when he had fallen into his first sleep she silently rose and uncovering her lamp beheld not a hideous monster but the most beautiful and charming of the gods
with two dewy wings on his shoulders whiter than snow and with shining feathers like the tender blossoms of spring as she leaned the lamp over to have a nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil fell on the shoulder of the god
startled with which he opened his eyes and fixed them full upon her then without saying one word he spread his white wings and flew out of the window psyche in vain endeavoring to follow him fell from the window to the ground
cupid beholding her as she lay in the dust stopped his flight for an instant and said o foolish psyche is it thus you repay my love after having disobeyed my mothers commands and made you my wife will you think me a monster and cut off my head
but go return to your sisters whose advice you seem to think preferable to mine i inflict no other punishment on you than to leave you forever love cannot dwell with suspicion so saying he fled away leaving poor psyche prostrate on the ground
filling the place with mournful lamentations when she had recovered some degree of composure she looked around her but the palace and gardens had vanished and she found herself in the open field not far from the city where her sisters dwelt
psyche meanwhile wandered day and night without food or repose in search of her husband casting her eyes on a lofty mountain having on its brow a magnificent temple she sighed and said to herself perhaps my love my lord inhabits there
and directed her steps thither she had no sooner entered than she saw heaps of corn some in loose ears and some in sheaves with mingled ears of barley
scattered about lay sickles and rakes and all the instruments of harvest without order as if thrown carelessly out of the weary reapers hands in the sultry hours of the day this unseemly confusion
by separating and sorting everything to its proper place and kind
to engage them all in her behalf the holy ceres whose temple it was finding her so religiously employed thus spoke to her o psyche truly worthy of our pity though i cannot shield you from the frowns of venus
yet i can teach you how best to allay her displeasure go then and voluntarily surrender yourself to your lady and sovereign and try by modesty and submission to win her forgiveness and perhaps her favor will restore you the husband you have lost
psyche obeyed the commands of ceres and took her way to the temple of venus endeavoring to fortify her mind and ruminating on what she should say and how best propitiate the angry goddess feeling that the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal
most undutiful and faithless of servants said she do you at last remember that you really have a mistress or have you rather come to see your sick husband yet laid up of the wound given him by his loving wife you are so ill favored and disagreeable
that the only way you can merit your lover must be by dint of industry and diligence i will make trial of your housewifery then she ordered psyche to be led to the storehouse of her temple
where was laid up a great quantity of wheat barley millet vetches beans and lentils prepared for food for her pigeons and said take and separate all these grains putting all of the same kind in a parcel by themselves
and see that you get it done before evening then venus departed and left her to her task but psyche in a perfect consternation at the enormous work sat stupid and silent without moving a finger to the inextricable heap
while she sat despairing cupid stirred up the little ant a native of the fields to take compassion on her the leader of the ant hill followed by whole hosts of his six legged subjects
approached the heap and with the utmost diligence taking grain by grain they separated the pile sorting each kind to its parcel and when it was all done they vanished out of sight in a moment
venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of the gods breathing odors and crowned with roses seeing the task done she exclaimed this is no work of yours wicked one
so saying she threw her a piece of black bread for her supper and went away next morning venus ordered psyche to be called and said to her behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the water
there you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd with golden shining fleeces on their backs go fetch me a sample of that precious wool gathered from every one of their fleeces
psyche obediently went to the riverside prepared to do her best to execute the command but the river god inspired the reeds with harmonious murmurs which seemed to say o maiden severely tried tempt not the dangerous flood
nor venture among the formidable rams on the other side for as long as they are under the influence of the rising sun they burn with a cruel rage to destroy mortals with their sharp horns or rude teeth but when the noontide sun has driven the cattle to the shade
and the serene spirit of the flood has lulled them to rest you may then cross in safety and you will find the woolly gold sticking to the bushes and the trunks of the trees thus the compassionate river god gave psyche instructions how to accomplish her task
and by observing his directions she soon returned to venus with her arms full of the golden fleece but she received not the approbation of her implacable mistress who said i know very well it is by none of your own doings that you have succeeded in this task
and i am not satisfied yet that you have any capacity to make yourself useful but i have another task for you here take this box and go your way to the infernal shades and give this box to proserpine
and say my mistress venus desires you to send her a little of your beauty for in tending her sick son she has lost some of her own be not too long on your errand for i must paint myself with it to appear at the circle of the gods and goddesses this evening
psyche was now satisfied that her destruction was at hand being obliged to go with her own feet directly down to erebus wherefore to make no delay of what was not to be avoided
she goes to the top of a high tower to precipitate herself headlong thus to descend the shortest way to the shades below but a voice from the tower said to her why poor unlucky girl dost thou design to put an end to thy days in so dreadful a manner
and what cowardice makes thee sink under this last danger who hast been so miraculously supported in all thy former then the voice told her how by a certain cave she might reach the realms of pluto and how to avoid all the dangers of the road
but the voice added when proserpine has given you the box filled with her beauty of all things this is chiefly to be observed by you
psyche encouraged by this advice obeyed it in all things and taking heed to her ways travelled safely to the kingdom of pluto she was admitted to the palace of proserpine
and without accepting the delicate seat or delicious banquet that was offered her but contented with coarse bread for her food she delivered her message from venus presently the box was returned to her shut and filled with the precious commodity
then she returned the way she came and glad was she to come out once more into the light of day but having got so far successfully through her dangerous task a longing desire seized her to examine the contents of the box
what said she shall i the carrier of this divine beauty not take the least bit to put on my cheeks to appear to more advantage in the eyes of my beloved husband so she carefully opened the box but found nothing there of any beauty at all
but an infernal and truly stygian sleep which being thus set free from its prison took possession of her and she fell down in the midst of the road a sleepy corpse without sense or motion but cupid being now recovered from his wound
and not able longer to bear the absence of his beloved psyche slipping through the smallest crack of the window of his chamber which happened to be left open flew to the spot where psyche lay
and gathering up the sleep from her body closed it again in the box and waked psyche with a light touch of one of his arrows again said he hast thou almost perished by the same curiosity
but now perform exactly the task imposed on you by my mother and i will take care of the rest then cupid as swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven presented himself before jupiter with his supplication jupiter lent a favoring ear
and pleaded the cause of the lovers so earnestly with venus that he won her consent on this he sent mercury to bring psyche up to the heavenly assembly and when she arrived handing her a cup of ambrosia he said drink this psyche and be immortal
nor shall cupid ever break away from the knot in which he is tied but these nuptials shall be perpetual thus psyche became at last united to cupid and in due time they had a daughter born to them whose name was pleasure
the fable of cupid and psyche is usually considered allegorical the greek name for a butterfly is psyche and the same word means the soul there is no illustration of the immortality of the soul so striking and beautiful as the butterfly
bursting on brilliant wings from the tomb in which it has lain after a dull grovelling caterpillar existence to flutter in the blaze of day and feed on the most fragrant and delicate productions of the spring psyche then is the human soul
which is purified by sufferings and misfortunes and is thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure happiness in works of art psyche is represented as a maiden with the wings of a butterfly along with cupid
in the different situations described in the allegory milton alludes to the story of cupid and psyche in the conclusion of his comus celestial cupid her famed son advanced holds his dear psyche sweet entranced
after her wandering labors long till free consent the gods among make her his eternal bride and from her fair unspotted side two blissful twins are to be born youth and joy so jove hath sworn
the allegory of the story of cupid and psyche is well presented in the beautiful lines of t k harvey they wove bright fables in the days of old when reason borrowed fancys painted wings
when truths clear river flowed oer sands of gold and told in song its high and mystic things and such the sweet and solemn tale of her the pilgrim heart to whom a dream was given that led her through the world loves worshipper
through the dim grottos tracery of spars mid the pine temples on the moonlit mount where silence sits to listen to the stars in the deep glade where dwells the brooding dove the painted valley and the scented air
she heard far echoes of the voice of love and found his footsteps traces everywhere but nevermore they met since doubts and fears those phantom shapes that haunt and blight the earth had come twixt her a child of sin and tears
and that bright spirit of immortal birth until her pining soul and weeping eyes had learned to seek him only in the skies till wings unto the weary heart were given and she became loves angel bride in heaven
the story of cupid and psyche first appears in the works of apuleius a writer of the second century of our era it is therefore of much more recent date than most of the legends of the age of fable it is this that keats alludes to in his ode to psyche
o latest born and loveliest vision far of all olympus faded hierarchy fairer than phoebes sapphire regioned star or vesper amorous glow worm of the sky fairer than these though temple thou hast none
nor altar heaped with flowers nor virgin choir to make delicious moan upon the midnight hours no voice no lute no pipe no incense sweet from chain swung censor teeming no shrine no grove no oracle no heat
of pale mouthed prophet dreaming in moores summer fete a fancy ball is described in which one of the characters personated is psyche not in dark disguise to night hath our young heroine veiled her light
for see she walks the earth loves own his wedded bride by holiest vow pledged in olympus and made known to mortals by the type which now hangs glittering on her snowy brow
fit for drink a country without a fit drink for cheese has no cheese fit for drink greece was the first country to prove its epicurean fitness according to the old saying above for it had wine to tipple
and sheeps milk cheese to nibble the classical greek cheese has always been feta and no doubt this was the kind
for her lovers she put further sweetness and body into the stirrup cup by stirring honey and barley meal into it today we might whip this up in an electric mixer to toast her memory
cheese is on the house at all wine sales for prospective customers to snack upon and thus bring out the full flavor of the cellared vintages but professional wine tasters are forbidden any cheese between sips
they may clear their palates with plain bread but nary a crumb of roquefort or cube of gruyere in working hours lest it give the wine a spurious nobility and speaking of roquefort
heavenly marriages are made in burgundy between red and white wines of both cotes
and de baune and burgundian cheeses such as
and port salut seem to be made for each other as do chateau margaux
such notables as sainte maure
vendome and the loire wines vouvray
and anjou gruyere mates with chablis
and any dry red wine most commonly claret is a fit drink for the hundreds of other fine french cheeses every country has such happy marriages an italian standard being provolone and chianti
then there is a most unusual pair french neufchatel cheese and swiss neuchatel wine from just across the border switzerland also has another cheese favorite at home
grape cheese named from the neuchatel wine in which it is aged
is also uniquely suited to the company of any good wine because it is made in the exact shape and size of a wine barrel bung a similar relation is found in brinzas
that are packed in miniature wine barrels strongly suggesting what should be drunk with such excellent cheeses hungarian tokay other foreign cheeses go to market wrapped in vine leaves the affinity has clearly been laid down in heaven
only the english seem to have a fortissimo taste in the go with wines according to these matches registered by andre simon in the art of good living red cheshire with light tawny port white cheshire
with oloroso sherry blue leicester with old vintage port green roquefort with new vintage port to these we might add brittle chips
with nips of amontillado for an eloquent appetizer the english also pour port into stilton and sundry other wines and liquors into cheddars and such this doctoring leads to fraudulent imitation however
for either port or stout is put into counterfeit cheshire cheese to make up for the richness it lacks while some combinations of cheeses and wines may turn out palatable we prefer taking ours straight when something more fiery is needed
de danzig and nibble on legitimate danzig cheese unadulterated goldwasser

with any caraway seeded cheese or cream cheese with a handy saucer of caraway seeds in the section of france devoted to gin the juniper berries that flavor the drink also go into a local cheese fromage fort
this is also true of our native jersey lightning and hard cider with their accompanying new york state cheese
farmers also drink homemade cider
the english sip pear cider perry with almost any british cheese milk would seem to be redundant but sage cheese and buttermilk do go well together
north and south tribe was giving place to tribe language to language for the indian hopelessly unchanging in respect to individual and social development was as regarded tribal relations and local haunts
mutable as the wind in canada and the northern section of the united states the elements of change were especially active the indian population which in fifteen thirty five cartier found at montreal and quebec
had disappeared at the opening of the next century and another race had succeeded in language and customs widely different while in the region now forming the state of new york a power was rising to a ferocious vitality which
but for the presence of europeans would probably have subjected absorbed or exterminated every other indian community east of the mississippi and north of the ohio the vast tract of wilderness from the mississippi to the atlantic
and from the carolinas to hudsons bay was divided between two great families of tribes distinguished by a radical difference of language a part of virginia and of pennsylvania new jersey southeastern new york new england
new brunswick nova scotia and lower canada were occupied so far as occupied at all by tribes speaking various algonquin languages and dialects they extended moreover along the shores of the upper lakes
westward the eries along the southern shore of lake erie and the neutral nation along its northern shore from niagara
on the whole these savages were favorable specimens of the algonquin stock belonging to that section of it which tilled the soil and was thus in some measure spared the extremes of misery and degradation
to which the wandering hunter tribes were often reduced they owed much also to the bounty of the sea and hence they tended towards the coast which before the epidemic champlain and smith had seen at many points studded with wigwams
and waving with harvests of maize fear too drove them eastward for the iroquois pursued them with an inveterate enmity some paid yearly tribute to their tyrants while others were still subject to their inroads
flying in terror at the sound of the mohawk war cry westward the population thinned rapidly northward it soon disappeared northern new hampshire the whole of vermont and western massachusetts had no human tenants but the roving hunter
or prowling warrior we have said that this group of tribes was relatively very populous yet it is more than doubtful whether all of them united had union been possible could have mustered eight thousand fighting men to speak further of them is needless
and the whole of new brunswick were occupied
to whom agriculture was unknown though the sea prolific of fish lobsters and seals greatly lightened their miseries
or micmacs of nova scotia closely resembled them in habits and condition from nova scotia to the saint lawrence there was no population worthy of the name from the gulf of saint lawrence to lake ontario the southern border of the great river
had no tenants but hunters northward between the saint lawrence and hudsons bay roamed the scattered hordes of the papinachois bersiamites and others included by the french under the general name
when in spring the french trading ships arrived and anchored in the port of tadoussac they gathered from far and near toiling painfully through the desolation of forests mustering by hundreds at the point of traffic
and setting up their bark wigwams along the strand of that wild harbor
their ordinary sustenance was derived from the chase though often goaded by deadly famine they would subsist on roots the bark and buds of trees
and in extremity even cannibalism was not rare among them ascending the saint lawrence it was seldom that the sight of a human form gave relief to the loneliness
from the verge of the cliff announced that the savage prologue of the american drama was drawing to a close and that the civilization of europe was advancing on the scene ascending farther all was solitude except at three rivers
a noted place of trade where a few algonquins of the tribe called atticamegues might possibly be seen
and as the voyager passed some wooded point or thicket covered island the whistling of a stone headed arrow proclaimed perhaps the presence of these fierce marauders at montreal there was no human life save during a brief space in early summer
when the shore swarmed with savages who had come to the yearly trade from the great communities of the interior
to morrow all again was solitude and the ottawa was covered with the canoes of the returning warriors along this stream a main route of traffic the silence of the wilderness was broken only by the splash of the passing paddle
to the north of the river there was indeed a small algonquin band called la petite nation together with one or two other feeble communities but they dwelt far from the banks through fear of the ubiquitous iroquois
it was nearly three hundred miles by the windings of the stream before one reached that algonquin tribe
then after many a day of lonely travel the voyager found a savage welcome among the nipissings on the lake which bears their name and then circling west and south for a hundred and fifty miles of solitude
he reached for the first time a people speaking a dialect of the iroquois tongue here all was changed populous towns rude fortifications and an extensive though barbarous tillage
indicated a people far in advance of the famished wanderers of the saguenay or their less abject kindred of new england
would have formed his christian empire in the wilderness but one by one these kindred peoples were uprooted and swept away while the neighboring algonquins to whom they had been a bulwark were involved with them in a common ruin
from whose conversion it was vain to look for the same solid and decisive results in a measure the occupation of the jesuits was gone some of them went home well resolved writes the father superior
about twenty in number several soon fell victims to famine
the guns and tomahawks of the iroquois were the ruin of their hopes could they have curbed or converted those ferocious bands it is little less than certain
savages tamed not civilized for that was scarcely possible would have been distributed in communities through the valleys of the great lakes and the mississippi ruled by priests in the interest of catholicity and of france
unmolested by indian enemies and fed by a rich commerce she would have put forth a vigorous growth true to her far reaching and adventurous genius she would have occupied the west with traders settlers and garrisons
while as yet the colonies of england were but a weak and broken line along the shore of the atlantic and when at last the great conflict came england and liberty would have been confronted
not by a depleted antagonist still feeble from the exhaustion of a starved and persecuted infancy but by an athletic champion of the principles of richelieu and of loyola liberty may thank the iroquois that by their insensate fury
and a peril and a woe averted from her future they ruined the trade which was the life blood of new france they stopped the current of her arteries and made all her early years a misery and a terror not that they changed her destinies
the contest on this continent between liberty and absolutism was never doubtful but the triumph of the one would have been dearly bought and the downfall of the other incomplete
populations formed in the ideas and habits of a feudal monarchy and controlled by a hierarchy profoundly hostile to freedom of thought would have remained a hindrance and a stumbling block in the way of that majestic experiment
of which america is the field the jesuits saw their hopes struck down and their faith though not shaken was sorely tried the providence of god seemed in their eyes dark and inexplicable but from the stand point of liberty
that providence is clear as the sun at noon meanwhile let those who have prevailed yield due honor to the defeated their virtues shine amidst the rubbish of error like diamonds and gold in the gravel of the torrent
but now new scenes succeed and other actors enter on the stage a hardy and valiant band moulded to endure and dare
true nervous very very dreadfully nervous i had been and am but why will you say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them
above all was the sense of hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven
i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and observe how healthily how calmly i can tell you the whole story it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once conceived
it haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no desire i think it was his eye
yes it was this he had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degrees very gradually
i made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i proceeded
with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him and every night about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened it
oh so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed that no light shone out and then i thrust in my head
oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it slowly very very slowly so that i might not disturb the old mans sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening
so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed ha would a madman have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiously oh so cautiously
for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night
so you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him while he slept upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door
never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think that there i was opening the door little by little
and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew back but no
his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door
steadily i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in bed crying out whos there i kept quite still and said nothing
for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listening just as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall
presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh no
when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept
deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart
when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney
it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain all in vain because death
in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room
when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a little a very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily
stealthily until at length a simple dim ray like the thread of the spider
and fell full upon the vulture eye it was open wide wide open and i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue
with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old mans face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot
and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the sense now i say there came to my ears
such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old mans heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage
but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray
meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old mans terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every moment
do you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror
yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbour the old mans hour had come
with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked once once only in an instant i dragged him to the floor
to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead
i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would trouble me no more
if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body the night waned and i worked hastily but in silence first of all i dismembered the corpse i cut off the head
and deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly that no human eye not even his could have detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash out no stain of any kind
no blood spot whatever i had been too wary for that a tub had caught all ha ha
it was four oclock still dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light heart for what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves
with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers
had been deputed to search the premises i smiled for what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country
i took my visitors all over the house i bade them search search well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence
placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily
they chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinct it continued
and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definiteness until at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very pale but i talked more fluently
and with a heightened voice yet the sound increased and what could i do it was a low dull quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not
i talked more quickly more vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone
i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamed i raved i swore
i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louder louder louder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled
was it possible they heard not almighty god no no they heard they suspected they knew they were making a mockery of my horror this i thought and this i think
but anything was better than this agony anything was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or die and now again hark louder louder
even to day in the courts of certain japanese temples you may see heaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose the largest collection of this kind that i ever saw was in the court of a temple of the jodo sect at hakata in kyushu
who presented her mirror to the temple to be used for bell metal but afterwards she much regretted her mirror she remembered things that her mother had told her about it and she remembered that it had belonged not only to her mother but to her mothers mother and grandmother and she remembered some happy smiles which it had reflected
but she had not the money necessary whenever she went to the temple she saw her mirror lying in the court yard behind a railing among hundreds of other mirrors heaped there together she knew it by the sho chiku bai in relief on the back of it those three fortunate emblems of pine bamboo and plumflower
which delighted her baby eyes when her mother first showed her the mirror she longed for some chance to steal the mirror and hide it that she might thereafter treasure it always but the chance did not come and she became very unhappy felt as if she had foolishly given away a part of her life
a saying mystically expressed by the chinese character for soul upon the backs of many bronze mirrors and she feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before imagined but she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody
evidently the woman who had given that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving she had not presented her offering with all her heart and therefore her selfish soul remaining attached to the mirror kept it hard and cold in the midst of the furnace
of course everybody heard of the matter and everybody soon knew whose mirror it was that would not melt and because of this public exposure of her secret fault the poor woman became very much ashamed and very angry and as she could not bear the shame she drowned herself
after having written a farewell letter containing these words when i am dead it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to cast the bell but to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it great wealth will be given by the ghost of me
but the bell proved to be a good bell and it bravely withstood their assaults nevertheless the people were not easily discouraged day after day at all hours they continued to ring the bell furiously caring nothing whatever for the protests of the priests
so the ringing became an affliction and the priests could not endure it and they got rid of the bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp the swamp was deep and swallowed it up and that was the end of the bell
or bell of mugen now there are queer old japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a certain mental operation implied though not described by the verb
the word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any english word for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic magic as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts of faith
to compare to liken but the esoteric meaning is to substitute in imagination one object or action for another so as to bring about some magical or miraculous result
for example you cannot afford to build a buddhist temple but you can easily lay a pebble before the image of the buddha with the same pious feeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough to build one the merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal or almost equal to the merit of erecting a temple
you cannot read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy one volumes of the buddhist texts but you can make a revolving library containing them turn round by pushing it like a windlass
so much will perhaps suffice to explain the religious meanings of nazoraeru the magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety of examples but for present purposes the following will serve if you should make a little man of straw
for the same reason that sister helen made a little man of wax and nail it
that would illustrate one signification of nazoraeru or let us suppose that a robber has entered your house during the night and carried away your valuables if you can discover the footprints of that robber in your garden and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them
the soles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed and will allow him no rest until he returns of his own accord to put himself at your mercy that is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term nazoraeru
after the bell had been rolled into the swamp there was of course no more chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it
but persons who regretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects imaginatively substituted for the bell thus hoping to please the spirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble one of these persons was a woman called umegae
while the pair were traveling together kajiwara one day found himself in great straits for want of money and umegae remembering the tradition of the bell of mugen took a basin of bronze and mentally representing it to be the bell beat upon it until she broke it
crying out at the same time for three hundred pieces of gold a guest of the inn where the pair were stopping
afterwards a song was made about umegaes basin of bronze and that song is sung by dancing girls even to this day umegae no chozubachi tataite
if by striking upon the wash basin of umegae i could make honorable money come to me
became great and many people followed the example of umegae thereby hoping to emulate her luck
as it deserves to be answered take therefore this jar so saying she put the jar into his hands and disappeared into his house the happy man rushed to tell his wife the good news he set down in front of her the covered jar which was heavy
and they opened it together and they found that it was filled up to the very brim with
jikininki once when muso kokushi
for a long time he wandered about helplessly and he was beginning to despair of finding shelter for the night when he perceived on the top of a hill lighted by the last rays of the sun one of those little hermitages called
which are built for solitary priests it seemed to be in ruinous condition but he hastened to it eagerly and found that it was inhabited by an aged priest from whom he begged the favor of a nights lodging
this the old man harshly refused but he directed muso to a certain hamlet in the valley adjoining where lodging and food could be obtained muso found his way to the hamlet which consisted of less than a dozen farm cottages
but a little before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud weeping in the next apartment presently the sliding screens were gently pushed apart and a young man carrying a lighted lantern entered the room respectfully saluted him and said
the people whom you saw in the next room are the inhabitants of this village
strange things always happen in the house where a corpse has thus been left so we think that it will be better for you to come away with us we can find you good lodging in the other village
but i am sorry that you did not tell me of your fathers death when i came for though i was a little tired i certainly was not so tired that i should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a priest had you told me i could have performed the service before your departure
as it is i shall perform the service after you have gone away and i shall stay by the body until morning i do not know what you mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone
then the other members of the family and the folk assembled in the adjoining room having been told of the priests kind promises came to thank him after which the master of the house said now reverend sir much as we regret to leave you alone we must bid you farewell
by the rule of our village none of us can stay here after midnight we beg kind sir that you will take every care of your honorable body while we are unable to attend upon you and if you happen to hear or see anything strange during our absence please tell us of the matter when we return in the morning
all then left the house except the priest who went to the room where the dead body was lying the usual offerings had been set before the corpse and a small buddhist lamp tomyo was burning
the priest recited the service and performed the funeral ceremonies after which he entered into meditation so meditating he remained through several silent hours and there was no sound in the deserted village
but when the hush of the night was at its deepest there noiselessly entered a shape vague and vast and in the same moment muso found himself without power to move or speak
he saw that shape lift the corpse as with hands devour it more quickly than a cat devours a rat beginning at the head and eating everything the hair and the bones and even the shroud and the monstrous thing having thus consumed the body
turned to the offerings and ate them also then it went away as mysteriously as it had come when the villagers returned next morning they found the priest awaiting them at the door of the headmans dwelling all in turn saluted him and when they had entered
and looked about the room no one expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and the offerings but the master of the house said to muso reverent sir you have probably seen unpleasant things during the night
all of us were anxious about you but now we are very happy to find you alive and unharmed gladly we would have stayed with you if it had been possible but the law of our village as i told you last evening obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place
and to leave the corpse alone whenever this law has been broken heretofore some great misfortune has followed whenever it is obeyed we find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence perhaps you have seen the cause
then muso told of the dim and awful shape that had entered the death chamber to devour the body and the offerings no person seemed to be surprised by his narration and the master of the house observed
what you have told us reverend sir agrees with what has been said about this matter from ancient time muso then inquired does not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service for your dead what priest the young man asked
the priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village answered muso i called at his anjitsu on the hill yonder he refused me lodging but told me the way here the listeners looked at each other as in astonishment
and after a moment of silence the master of the house said reverend sir there is no priest and there is no anjitsu on the hill for the time of many generations there has not been any resident priest in this neighborhood muso said nothing more on the subject
for it was evident that his kind hosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin but after having bidden them farewell and obtained all necessary information as to his road he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill and so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived
and this time its aged occupant invited him to enter when he had done so the hermit humbly bowed down before him exclaiming ah i am ashamed i am very much ashamed i am exceedingly ashamed
you need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter said muso you directed me to the village yonder where i was very kindly treated and i thank you for that favor i can give no man shelter the recluse made answer
so in that time the bodies of the mountain folk who died used to be brought here sometimes from great distances in order that i might repeat over them the holy service but i repeated the service and performed the rites only as a matter of business
i thought only of the food and the clothes that my sacred profession enabled me to gain and because of this selfish impiety i was reborn immediately after my death into the state of a jikininki
since then i have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of the people who die in this district every one of them i must devour in the way that you saw last night now reverend sir
help me by your prayers i entreat you so that i may be soon able to escape from this horrible state of existence no sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared and the hermitage also disappeared at the same instant
all the capacities of a daring and skillful soldier
but as he had never sought distinction for his own sake alone and as his heart remained true to his former lord he preferred to give up the world so he cut off his hair and became a traveling priest taking the buddhist name of kwairyo
as in other years he had laughed at peril so now also he scorned danger
so he resigned himself to pass the night under the stars and having found a suitable grassy spot by the roadside he lay down there and prepared to sleep
he had always welcomed discomfort and even a bare rock was for him a good bed when nothing better could be found and the root of a pine tree an excellent pillow his body was iron and he never troubled himself about dews or rain or frost or snow
scarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road carrying an axe and a great bundle of chopped wood this woodcutter halted on seeing kwairyo lying down
and after a moment of silent observation said to him in a tone of great surprise what kind of a man can you be good sir that you dare to lie down alone in such a place as this there are haunters about here many of them are you not afraid of hairy things
my friend cheerfully answered kwairyo i am only a wandering priest a cloud and water guest as folks call it
as for lonesome places i like them they are suitable for meditation i am accustomed to sleeping in the open air and i have learned never to be anxious about my life
to lie down here this place has a bad name a very bad name but as the proverb has it kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu the superior man does not needlessly expose himself to peril
and i must assure you sir that it is very dangerous to sleep here therefore although my house is only a wretched thatched hut let me beg of you to come home with me at once in the way of food i have nothing to offer you but there is a roof at least and you can sleep under it without risk
accepted this modest offer the woodcutter guided him along a narrow path leading up from the main road through mountain forest it was a rough and dangerous path sometimes skirting precipices sometimes offering nothing but a network of
slippery roots for the foot to rest upon sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock but at last kwairyo found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill with a full moon shining overhead and he saw before him a small thatched cottage
and they must have been taught by some one well acquainted with the rules of propriety then turning to his host the aruji or house master as the others called him kwairyo said
from the kindness of your speech and from the very polite welcome given me by your household i imagine that you have not always been a woodcutter perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes smiling the woodcutter answered sir you are not mistaken
though now living as you find me i was once a person of some distinction my story is the story of a ruined life ruined by my own fault i used to be in the service of a daimyo and my rank in that service was not inconsiderable
but i loved women and wine too well and under the influence of passion i acted wickedly
retribution followed me and i long remained a fugitive in the land now i often pray that i may be able to make some atonement for the evil which i did and to reestablish the ancestral home but i fear that i shall never find any way of so doing
kwairyo was pleased by this announcement of good resolve and he said to the aruji my friend i have had occasion to observe that man prone to folly in their youth may in after years become very earnest in right living
in the holy sutras it is written that those strongest in wrong doing can become by power of good resolve the strongest in right doing i do not doubt that you have a good heart and i hope that better fortune will come to you
to night i shall recite the sutras for your sake and pray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past errors with these assurances kwairyo bade the aruji good night and his host showed him to a very small side room where a bed had been made ready
then all went to sleep except the priest who began to read the sutras by the light of a paper lantern until a late hour he continued to read and pray
the night was beautiful there was no cloud in the sky there was no wind and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of foliage and glittered on the dews of the garden
and the sound of the neighboring cascade deepened with the night kwairyo felt thirsty as he listened to the noise of the water and remembering the bamboo aqueduct at the rear of the house he thought that he could go there and get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household
very gently he pushed apart the sliding screens that separated his room from the main apartment and he saw by the light of the lantern five recumbent bodies without heads
for one instant he stood bewildered imagining a crime but in another moment he perceived that there was no blood and that the headless necks did not look as if they had been cut then he thought to himself
and remove the body to another place the head will never be able to join itself again to the neck and the book further says that when the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved it will strike itself upon the floor three times bounding like a ball and will pant as in great fear
and presently die now if these be rokuro kubi they mean me no good so i shall be justified in following the instructions of the book he seized the body of the aruji by the feet pulled it to the window and pushed it out
gently unbarring the door he made his way to the garden and proceeded with all possible caution to the grove beyond it he heard voices talking in the grove and he went in the direction of the voices stealing from shadow to shadow until he reached a good hiding place
then from behind a trunk he caught sight of the heads all five of them flitting about and chatting as they flitted they were eating worms and insects which they found on the ground or among the trees
presently the head of the aruji stopped eating and said ah that traveling priest who came to night how fat all his body is when we shall have eaten him our bellies will be well filled i was foolish to talk to him as i did
to go near him while he is reciting would be difficult and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying but as it is now nearly morning perhaps he has gone to sleep some one of you go to the house and see what the fellow is doing
another head the head of a young woman immediately rose up and flitted to the house lightly as a bat after a few minutes it came back and cried out huskily in a tone of great alarm that traveling priest is not in the house he is gone but that is not the worst of the matter
he has taken the body of our aruji and i do not know where he has put it at this announcement the head of the aruji distinctly visible in the moonlight assumed a frightful aspect its eyes opened monstrously its hair stood up bristling and its teeth gnashed
since my body has been moved to rejoin it is not possible then i must die and all through the work of that priest
and there he is behind that tree hiding behind that tree see him the fat coward in the same moment the head of the aruji followed by the other four heads sprang at kwairyo
but the strong priest had already armed himself by plucking up a young tree and with that tree he struck the heads as they came knocking them from him with tremendous blows four of them fled away but the head of the aruji though battered again and again desperately continued to bound at the priest
and at last caught him by the left sleeve of his robe kwairyo however as quickly gripped the head by its topknot and repeatedly struck it it did not release its hold but it uttered a long moan and thereafter ceased to struggle it was dead
but its teeth still held the sleeve and for all his great strength kwairyo could not force open the jaws with the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house and there caught sight of the other four rokuro kubi squatting together
with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their bodies but when they perceived him at the back door all screamed the priest the priest and fled through the other doorway out into the woods eastward the sky was brightening day was about to dawn
and kwairyo knew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of darkness he looked at the head clinging to his sleeve its face all fouled with blood and foam and clay and he laughed aloud as he thought to himself
after which he gathered together his few belongings and leisurely descended the mountain to continue his journey right on he journeyed until he came to suwa
seized the priest and took him to jail for they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who in the moment of being killed had caught the murderers sleeve in his teeth as the kwairyo he only smiled and said nothing when they questioned him
so after having passed a night in prison he was brought before the magistrates of the district then he was ordered to explain how he a priest had been found with the head of a man fastened to his sleeve and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade his crime in the sight of people
kwairyo laughed long and loudly at these questions and then he said sirs i did not fasten the head to my sleeve it fastened itself there much against my will and i have not committed any crime for this is not the head of a man it is the head of a goblin
but the magistrates did not laugh they judged him to be a hardened criminal and his story an insult to their intelligence therefore without further questioning they decided to order his immediate execution all of them except one
a very old man this aged officer had made no remark during the trial but after having heard the opinion of his colleagues he rose up and said let us first examine the head carefully for this i think has not yet been done
the old man turned it round and round carefully examined it and discovered on the nape of its neck several strange red characters he called the attention of his colleagues to these and also bade them observe that the edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been cut by any weapon
on the contrary the line of leverance was smooth as the line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem then said the elder i am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth this is the head of a rokuro kubi
there are the characters you can see for yourselves that they have not been painted moreover it is well known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the province of kai from very ancient time but you sir he exclaimed turning to kwairyo
perhaps you once belonged to the samurai class
before becoming a priest i long followed the profession of arms and in those days i never feared man or devil my name then was isogai heidazaemon taketsura of kyushu there may be some among you who remember it
at the mention of that name a murmur of admiration filled the court room for there were many present who remembered it and kwairyo immediately found himself among friends instead of judges friends anxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness
when kwairyo left suwa he was as happy as any priest is permitted to be in this transitory world as for the head he took it with him jocosely insisting that he intended it for a miyage and now it only remains to tell what became of the head
a day or two after leaving suwa kwairyo met with a robber who stopped him in a lonesome place and bade him strip kwairyo at once removed his koromo and offered it to the robber who then first perceived what was hanging to the sleeve
though brave the highwayman was startled he dropped the garment and sprang back then he cried out you
kwairyo answered i shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist but i must tell you that this is not the head of a man it is a goblins head so if you buy it and have any trouble in consequence please to remember that you were not deceived by me
what a nice priest you are exclaimed the robber you kill men and jest about it but i am really in earnest here is my robe and here is the money and let me have the head what is the use of joking
take the thing said kwairyo i was not joking
and he then became afraid that the spirit of the rokuro kubi might give him trouble so he made up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had come and to bury it with its body he found his way to the lonely cottage in the mountains of kai but nobody was there
and he could not discover the body therefore he buried the head by itself in the grove behind the cottage and he had a tombstone set up over the grave and he caused a segaki service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of the rokuro kubi
the family at the locusts had slept or watched through all the disturbances at the cottage of birch in perfect ignorance of their occurrence the attacks of the skinners were always made with so much privacy as to exclude the sufferers
but frequently through a dread of future depredations from the commiseration of their neighbors also additional duties had drawn the ladies from their pillows at an hour somewhat earlier than usual and captain lawton
notwithstanding the sufferings of his body had risen in compliance with a rule from which he never departed of sleeping but six hours at a time this was one of the few points in which the care of the human frame was involved on which the trooper and the surgeon of horse were ever known to agree
the doctor had watched during the night by the side of the bed of captain singleton without once closing his eyes occasionally he would pay a visit to the wounded englishman who being more hurt in the spirit than in the flesh
tolerated the interruptions with a very ill grace and once for an instant he ventured to steal softly to the bed of his obstinate comrade and was near succeeding in obtaining a touch of his pulse when a terrible oath sworn by the trooper in a dream
startled the prudent surgeon and warned him of a trite saying in the corps that captain lawton always slept with one eye open this group had assembled in one of the parlors as the sun made its appearance over the eastern hill dispersing the columns of fog which had enveloped the lowland
miss peyton was looking from a window in the direction of the tenement of the peddler and was expressing a kind anxiety after the welfare of the sick man when the person of katy suddenly emerged from the dense covering of an earthly cloud whose mists were scattering before the cheering rays of the sun
and was seen making hasty steps towards the locusts there was that in the air of the housekeeper which bespoke distress of an unusual nature and the kind hearted mistress of the locusts opened the door of the room with the benevolent intention of soothing a grief
that seemed so overwhelming a nearer view of the disturbed features of the visitor confirmed miss peyton in her belief and with the shock that gentle feelings ever experience at a sudden and endless separation from even the meanest of their associates she said hastily
katy is he gone no maam replied the disturbed damsel with great bitterness he is not yet gone but he may go as soon as he pleases now for the worst is done
and those he has on are none of the best i can tell you how exclaimed the other astonished could anyone have the heart to plunder a man in such distress hearts repeated katy catching her breath men like them have no bowels at all plunder and distress indeed
why maam there were in the iron pot in plain sight fifty four guineas of gold besides what lay underneath which i couldnt count without handling and i didnt like to touch it for they say that anothers gold is apt to stick so judging from that in sight there wasnt less than two hundred guineas
besides what might have been in the deerskin purse but harvey is little better now than a beggar and a beggar miss jeanette is the most awfully despisable of all earthly creatures
the countenance of katy changed from the natural expression of concern to the set form of melancholy as she answered he is happily removed from the cares of the world the chinking of the money made him get out of his bed and the poor soul found the shock too great for him
he died about two hours and ten minutes before the cock crowed as near as we can say she was interrupted by the physician who approaching inquired with much interest the nature of the disorder glancing her eye over the figure of this new acquaintance katy instinctively adjusting her dress
replied twas the troubles of the times and the loss of property that brought him down he wasted from day to day and all my care and anxiety were lost for now harvey is no better than a beggar and who is there to pay me for what i have done
god will reward you for all the good you have done said miss peyton mildly yes interrupted the spinster hastily and with an air of reverence that was instantly succeeded by an expression that denoted more of worldly care
but then i have left my wages for three years past in the hands of harvey and how am i to get them my brothers told me again and again to ask for my money but i always thought accounts between relations were easily settled were you related then to birch asked miss peyton observing her to pause
why returned the housekeeper hesitating a little i thought we were as good as so i wonder if i have no claim on the house and garden though they say now it is harveys it will surely be confiscated turning to lawton who had been sitting in one posture with his
piercing eyes lowering at her through his thick brows in silence perhaps this gentleman knows he seems to take an interest in my story madam said the trooper bowing very low both you and the tale are extremely interesting katy smiled involuntarily
but my humble knowledge is limited to the setting of a squadron in the field and using it when there i beg leave to refer you to doctor archibald sitgreaves a gentleman of universal attainments and unbounded philanthropy the very milk of human sympathies and a mortal foe to all indiscriminate cutting
the surgeon drew up and employed himself in whistling a low air as he looked over some phials on a table but the housekeeper turning to him with an inclination of the head continued i suppose sir a woman has no dower in her husbands property unless they be actually married
it was a maxim with doctor sitgreaves that no species of knowledge was to be despised and consequently he was an empiric in everything but his profession at first indignation at the irony of his comrade kept him silent but suddenly changing his purpose
he answered the applicant with a good natured smile i judge not if death has anticipated your nuptials i am fearful you have no remedy against his stern decrees to katy this sounded well although she understood nothing of its meaning but death and nuptials
to this part of his speech then she directed her reply i did think he only waited the death of the old gentleman before he married said the housekeeper looking on the carpet but now he is nothing more than despisable or whats the same thing a peddler without house pack or money
it might be hard for a man to get a wife at all in such a predicary dont you think it would miss peyton i seldom trouble myself with such things said the lady gravely during this dialogue captain lawton had been studying the countenance and manner of the housekeeper with a most ludicrous gravity
and fearful the conversation would cease he inquired with an appearance of great interest you think it was age and debility that removed the old gentleman at last and the troublesome times trouble is a heavy pull down to a sick bed
but i suppose his time had come and when that happens it matters but little what doctors stuff we take let me set you right in that particular interrupted the surgeon we must all die it is true but it is permitted us to use the lights of science in arresting dangers as they occur until
we can die secundem artem cried the trooper to this observation the physician did not deign to reply but deeming it necessary to his professional dignity that the conversation should continue he added perhaps in this instance judicious treatment might have prolonged the life of the patient
who administered to the case no one yet said the housekeeper with quickness i expect he has made his last will and testament the surgeon disregarded the smile of the ladies and pursued his inquiries it is doubtless wise to be prepared for death but under whose care was the sick man during his indisposition
under mine answered katy with an air of a little importance and care thrown away i may well call it for harvey is quite too despisable to be any sort of compensation at present the mutual ignorance of each others meaning made very little interruption to the dialogue
i doctored him mostly with yarbs said the housekeeper smiling as if conscious of error with simples returned the surgeon they are safer in the hands of the unlettered than more powerful remedies but why had you no regular attendant
im sure harvey has suffered enough already from having so much concerns with the riglars replied the housekeeper he has lost his all and made himself a vagabond through the land and i have reason to rue the day i ever crossed the threshold of his house
doctor sitgreaves does not mean a riglar soldier but a regular physician madam said the trooper oh cried the maiden again correcting herself for the best of all reasons there was none to be had so i took care of him myself
for my part i am clear for doctoring though harvey says i am killing myself with medicines
therein you show your sense said the surgeon approaching the spinster who sat holding the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet to the genial heat of a fine fire making the most of comfort amid all her troubles
you appear to be a sensible discreet woman and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science although the housekeeper did not altogether comprehend the others meaning she knew he used a compliment
and as such was highly pleased with what he said
it was always said of me that i wanted nothing but opportunity to make quite a physician myself so long as before i came to live with harveys father they called me the petticoat doctor more true than civil i dare say returned the surgeon losing sight of the womans character in his admiration of her respect for the healing art
in the absence of more enlightened counselors the experience of a discreet matron is frequently of great efficacy in checking the progress of disease under such circumstances madam it is dreadful to have to contend with ignorance and obstinacy
harvey is as obstinate about such things as a dumb beast one would think the care i took of his bedridden father might learn him better than to despise good nursing but some day he may know what it is to want a careful woman in his house though now i am sure he is too despisable himself to have a house
indeed i can easily comprehend the mortification you must have felt in having one so self willed to deal with returned the surgeon glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade but you should rise superior to such opinions and pity the ignorance by which they are engendered
the housekeeper hesitated a moment at a loss to comprehend all that the surgeon expressed yet she felt it was both complimentary and kind therefore suppressing her natural flow of language a little she replied
i tell harvey his conduct is often condemnable and last night he made my words good but the opinions of such unbelievers is not very consequential yet it is dreadful to think how he behaves at times now when he threw away the needle
what said the surgeon interrupting her does he affect to despise the needle but it is my lot to meet with men daily who are equally perverse and who show a still more culpable disrespect for the information that flows from the lights of science
the morning found them all restored in some measure to their former ease of body with the exception of the youthful captain of dragoons who had been so deeply regretted by dunwoodie the wound of this officer was severe though the surgeon persevered in saying that it was without danger
and doctor sitgreaves removed all further apprehensions by confidently pronouncing that he would be a well man within a fortnight
he breakfasted in his own room and notwithstanding certain significant smiles of the man of science
and the latter advanced promptly and laid his fingers on the pulse of the youth beckoning to him to be silent while he muttered growing symptoms of a febrile pulse no no my dear george you must remain quiet and dumb though your eyes look better and your skin has even a moisture
nay my dear sitgreaves said the youth taking his hand you see there is no fever about me look is there any of jack lawtons hoarfrost on my tongue no indeed said the surgeon clapping a spoon in the mouth of the other forcing it open and looking down his throat as if disposed to visit the interior in person
the tongue is well and the pulse begins to lower again ah the bleeding did you good phlebotomy is a sovereign specific for southern constitutions
why george your case is becoming singular continued the doctor instinctively throwing aside his wig your pulse even and soft your skin moist but your eye fiery and cheek flushed oh i must examine more closely into these symptoms
softly my good friend softly said the youth falling back on his pillow and losing some of that color which alarmed his companion i believe in extracting the ball you did for me all that is required i am free from pain and only weak i do assure you captain singleton said the surgeon with heat
it is presumptuous in you to pretend to tell your medical attendant when you are free from pain if it be not to enable us to decide in such matters of what avail the lights of science for shame george for shame even that perverse fellow john lawton could not behave with more obstinacy
his patient smiled as he gently repulsed his physician in an attempt to undo the bandages and with a returning glow to his cheeks inquired
if anyone interferes with my patients cried the doctor hastily i will teach them spirit or no spirit what it is to meddle with another mans concerns tut my dear fellow there was no interference made nor any intended see exhibiting the bandages
everything is as you left it but it glided about the room with the grace of a fairy and the tenderness of an angel
as he inquired with a brevity that would have honored lieutenant mason had it petticoats george i saw nothing but its heavenly eyes its bloom its majestic step its grace replied the young man with rather more ardor than his surgeon thought consistent with his debilitated condition
hem with something of the kind of step you speak of a very complacent eye and as to the bloom i dare say offices of charity can summon as fine a color to her cheeks as glows in the faces of her more youthful nieces nieces has she nieces then
the angel i saw may be a daughter a sister or a niece but never an aunt hush george hush your talking has brought your pulse up again you must observe quiet and prepare for a meeting with your own sister who will be here within an hour what isabella and who sent for her
the major considerate dunwoodie murmured the exhausted youth sinking again on his pillow where the commands of his attendant compelled him to remain silent even captain lawton had been received with many and courteous inquiries after the state of his health
from all the members of the family when he made his morning entrance but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the english colonel sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room yet she knew the position of every glass and had with her own hands supplied the contents of every bowl that stood on his table
at the time of our tale we were a divided people and sarah thought it was no more than her duty to cherish the institutions of that country to which she yet clung as the land of her forefathers but there were other and more cogent reasons for the silent preference she was giving to the englishman
it is true he wanted the personal excellence of peyton dunwoodie but his pretensions were far from contemptible sarah had moved about the house during the morning casting frequent and longing glances at the door of wellmeres apartment anxious to learn the condition of his wounds and yet ashamed to inquire
conscious interest kept her tongue tied until her sister with the frankness of innocence had put the desired question to doctor sitgreaves colonel wellmere said the operator gravely is in what i call a state of free will madam he is ill or he is well as he pleases
his case young lady exceeds my art to heal and i take it sir henry clinton is the best adviser he can apply to though major dunwoodie has made the communication with his leech rather difficult frances smiled but averted her face while sarah moved with the grace of an offended juno from the apartment
her own room however afforded her but little relief and in passing through the long gallery that communicated with each of the chambers of the building she noticed the door of singletons room to be open the wounded youth seemed sleeping and was alone
and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon nor was the luster of her eye in any degree diminished the sound of the approaching footsteps of sitgreaves hastened her retreat down a private stairway to the side of her sister
the sisters then sought the fresh air on the piazza and as they pursued their walk arm in arm the following dialogue took place there is something disagreeable about this surgeon of dunwoodie said sarah that causes me to wish him away most heartily
frances fixed her laughing eyes on her sister but forbearing to speak the other readily construed their expression and hastily added but i forget he is one of your renowned corps of virginians and must be spoken of reverently as respectfully as you please my dear sister
there is but little danger of exceeding the truth
but i think mister dunwoodie has taken a liberty that exceeds the rights of consanguinity he has made our fathers house a hospital we ought to be grateful that none of the patients it contains are dearer to us your brother is one true true interrupted frances blushing to the eyes
but he leaves his room and thinks his wound lightly purchased by the pleasure of being with his friends if she added with a tremulous lip this dreadful suspicion that is affixed to his visit were removed i could consider his wound of little moment you now have the fruits of rebellion brought home to you
a brother wounded and a prisoner and perhaps a victim your father distressed his privacy interrupted and not improbably his estates torn from him on account of his loyalty to his king frances continued her walk in silence while facing the northern entrance to the vale
her eyes were uniformly fastened on the point where the road was suddenly lost by the intervention of a hill and at each turn as she lost sight of the spot she lingered until an impatient movement of her sister quickened her pace to an even motion with that of her own
at length a single horse chaise was seen making its way carefully among the stones which lay scattered over the country road that wound through the valley and approached the cottage
the color of frances changed as the vehicle gradually drew nearer and when she was enabled to see a female form in it by the side of a black in livery her limbs shook with an agitation that compelled her to lean on sarah for support in a few minutes the travelers approached the gate
it was thrown open by a dragoon who followed the carriage and who had been the messenger dispatched by dunwoodie to the father of captain singleton miss peyton advanced to receive their guest and the sisters united in giving her the kindest welcome
still frances could with difficulty withdraw her truant eyes from the countenance of their visitor she was young and of a light and fragile form but of exquisite proportions her eyes were large full black piercing and at times a little wild her hair was luxuriant
and as it was without the powder it was then the fashion to wear it fell in raven blackness a few of its locks had fallen on her cheek giving its chilling whiteness by the contrast a more deadly character
doctor sitgreaves supported her from the chaise and when she gained the floor of the piazza she turned an expressive look on the face of the practitioner your brother is out of danger and wishes to see you miss singleton said the surgeon the lady burst into a flood of tears
frances had stood contemplating the action and face of isabella with a kind of uneasy admiration but she now sprang to her side with the ardor of a sister and kindly drawing her arm within her own led the way to a retired room
the feeling was communicated to all the spectators and they dispersed in pursuit of their usual avocations isabella yielded to the gentle influence of frances without resistance
and having gained the room where the latter conducted her wept in silence on the shoulder of the observant and soothing girl until frances thought her tears exceeded the emotion natural to the occasion
the sobs of miss singleton for a time were violent and uncontrollable until with an evident exertion she yielded to a kind observation of her companion and succeeded in suppressing her tears raising her face to the eyes of frances she rose
more composed than her previous agitation had given reason to expect isabella found her brother looking better and in less danger than her sensitive imagination had led her to suppose her spirits rose in proportion from despondency she passed to something like gayety
her beautiful eyes sparkled with renovated brilliancy and her face was lighted with smiles so fascinating that frances who in compliance with her earnest entreaties had accompanied her to the sick chamber sat gazing on a countenance that possessed so wonderful variability
impelled by a charm that was beyond her control the youth had thrown an earnest look at frances as soon as his sister raised herself from his arms and perhaps it was the first glance at the lovely lineaments of our heroine
when the gazer turned his eyes from the view in disappointment he seemed bewildered rubbed his forehead like a man awaking from a dream and mused where is dunwoodie isabella he said the excellent fellow is never weary of kind actions after a day of such service as that of yesterday
he has spent the night in bringing me a nurse whose presence alone is able to raise me from my couch the expression of the ladys countenance changed
but isabella the meeting has been too much for you you tremble isabella made no reply she stretched her hand towards the table which held the nourishment of the captain and the attentive frances comprehended her wishes in a moment a glass of water in some measure revived the sister who was enabled to say
doubtless it is his duty twas said above a royal party was moving on the river though i passed the troops but two miles from this spot the latter part of the sentence was hardly audible and it was spoken more in the manner of a soliloquy than as if for the ears of her companions
on the march isabella eagerly inquired her brother no dismounted and seemingly at rest was the reply the wondering dragoon turned his gaze on the countenance of his sister who sat with her eye bent on the carpet in unconscious absence but found no explanation
his look was changed to the face of frances who startled by the earnestness of his expression arose and hastily inquired if he would have any assistance if you can pardon the rudeness said the wounded officer making a feeble effort to raise his body i would request to have captain lawtons company for a moment
frances hastened instantly to communicate his wish to that gentleman and impelled by an interest she could not control she returned again to her seat by the side of miss singleton lawton said the youth impatiently as the trooper entered hear you from the major
the eye of the sister was now bent on the face of the trooper who made his salutations to the lady with ease blended with the frankness of a soldier his man has been here twice he said to inquire how we fared in the lazaretto and why not himself
that is a question the major can answer best but you know the redcoats are abroad and dunwoodie commands in the county these english must be looked to true said singleton slowly as if struck with the others reasons but how is it that you are idle when there is work to do
my sword arm is not in the best condition and roanoke has but a shambling gait this morning besides there is another reason i could mention if it were not that miss wharton would never forgive me
speak i beg without dread of my displeasure said frances returning the good humored smile of the trooper with the archness natural to her own sweet face the odors of your kitchen then cried lawton bluntly forbid my quitting the domains until i qualify myself to speak with more certainty concerning the fatness of the land
oh aunt jeanette is exerting herself to do credit to my fathers hospitality said the laughing girl and i am a truant from her labors as i shall be a stranger to her favor unless i proffer my assistance
frances withdrew to seek her aunt musing deeply on the character and extreme sensibility of the new acquaintance chance had brought to the cottage the wounded officer followed her with his eyes as she moved with infantile grace through the door of his apartment and as she vanished from his view he observed
a good motherly lady but as to love that is a matter of taste a few years younger with deference to her prudence and experience would accord better with my fancy she must be under twenty said the other quickly it depends on the way you count if you begin at the heel of life well
but if you reckon downward as is most common i think she is nearer forty you have mistaken an elder sister for the aunt said isabella laying her fair hand on the mouth of the invalid you must be silent your feelings are beginning to affect your frame
the entrance of doctor sitgreaves who in some alarm noticed the increase of feverish symptoms in his patient enforced this mandate and the trooper withdrew to pay a visit of condolence to roanoke who had been an equal sufferer with himself in their last nights somersault
to his great joy his man pronounced the steed to be equally convalescent with the master and lawton found that by dint of rubbing the animals limbs several hours without ceasing he was enabled to place his feet in what he called systematic motion
orders were accordingly given to be in readiness to rejoin the troop at the four corners as soon as his master had shared in the bounty of the approaching banquet
and by his sympathy succeeded in restoring the colonel to his own good graces
wharton knew that their misfortune as they both termed their defeat was owing to the others rashness but he forbore to speak of anything except the unfortunate accident which had deprived the english of their leader and to which he good naturedly ascribed their subsequent discomfiture
in short wharton said the colonel putting one leg out of bed it may be called a combination of untoward events your own ungovernable horse prevented my orders from being carried to the major in season to flank the rebels very true replied the captain kicking a slipper towards the bed
had we succeeded in getting a few good fires upon them in flank we should have sent these brave virginians to the right about aye and that in double quick time cried the colonel making the other leg follow its companion then it was necessary to rout the guides you know and the movement gave them the best possible opportunity to charge
yes said the other sending the second slipper after the first and this major dunwoodie never overlooks an advantage i think if we had the thing to do over again continued the colonel raising himself on his feet we might alter the case very materially though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture
they were repulsed you saw in their attempt to drive us from the wood at least they would have been had they made an attack said the captain throwing the rest of his clothes within reach of the colonel
true true cried the colonel with animation had i been there to have improved that advantage we might have turned the table on the yankees saying which he displayed still greater animation in completing his toilet and he was soon prepared to make his appearance fully restored to his own good opinion and fairly persuaded that his capture was owing to casualties absolutely beyond the control of man
chapter six of what took place between don quixote and his niece and housekeeper one of the most important chapters in the whole history
but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron nevertheless among many other representations made to him the housekeeper said to him in truth master if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home
what answer god will give to your complaints housekeeper i know not nor what his majesty will answer either i only know that if i were king i should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day
and therefore i should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him whereupon the housekeeper said tell us senor at his majestys court are there no knights there are replied don quixote and plenty of them and it is right there should be
to set off the dignity of the prince and for the greater glory of the kings majesty then might not your worship said she be one of those that without stirring a step serve their king and lord in his court
there must be all sorts in the world
there is a great difference between one and another for the courtiers without quitting their chambers or the threshold of the court range the world over by looking at a map without its costing them a farthing and without suffering heat or cold hunger or thirst
but we the true knights errant measure the whole earth with our own feet exposed to the sun to the cold to the air to the inclemencies of heaven by day and night on foot and on horseback
nor do we only know enemies in pictures but in their own real shapes and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword
whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man that you know nothing about but i do
and you must know besides that the true knight errant though he may see ten giants that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them and that go each of them on two tall towers by way of legs and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships and each eye like a great mill wheel
and glowing brighter than a glass furnace must not on any account be dismayed by them on the contrary he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart and if possible vanquish and destroy them even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish
wield trenchant blades of damascus steel or clubs studded with spikes also of steel such as i have more than once seen
and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second or more properly speaking first kind of knights errant for as we read in their histories
i would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with what can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights errant
for he was the most humble minded and courteous knight of his time
but some there are that might have heard thee and it would not have been well for thee in that case for they are not all courteous or mannerly some are ill conditioned scoundrels nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman that is so in all respects some are gold others pinchbeck
and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
god bless me said the niece that you should know so much uncle
and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old strong when you are sickly able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age and above all a caballero when you are not one
all the lineages in the world attend to what i am saying can be reduced to four sorts which are these those that had humble beginnings and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness those that had great beginnings and maintained them
and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin those again that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid having reduced and lessened their original greatness
those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve
for examples of the second sort of lineage that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it
of countless princes monarchs lords medes assyrians persians greeks and barbarians all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing
for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants and even should we find one it would be in some lowly and humble condition of plebeian lineages i have nothing to say save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
and not by spending as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well the poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue by being affable well bred courteous gentle mannered and kindly not haughty arrogant or censorious
but above all by being charitable for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell ringing and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues i have named
even though he know him not will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood and it would be strange were it not so praise has ever been the reward of virtue and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation
there are two roads my daughters by which men may reach wealth and honours one is that of letters the other that of arms
i am therefore in a measure constrained to follow that road
and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills fate ordains reason requires and above all my own inclination favours for knowing as i do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight errantry
i know too the infinite blessings that are attained by it i know that the path of virtue is very narrow and the road of vice broad and spacious i know their ends and goals are different for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death
i know as our great castilian poet says that it is by rugged paths like these they go that scale the heights of immortality unreached by those that falter here below
i can tell you niece replied don quixote if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties there would be nothing that i could not do nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands particularly cages and tooth picks
at this moment there came a knocking at the door
nothing senor samson said she only that my master is breaking out plainly breaking out whereabouts is he breaking out senora asked samson has any part of his body burst he is only breaking out at the door of his madness she replied
so that to bring him round again ever so little cost me more than six hundred eggs
that i can well believe replied the bachelor for they are so good and so fat and so well bred that they would not say one thing for another though they were to burst for it in short then mistress housekeeper that is all
say the prayer of santa apollonia that is if you know it for i will come presently and you will see miracles woe is me cried the housekeeper
that would do if it was the toothache my master had
i know what i am saying mistress housekeeper
replied carrasco and with this the housekeeper retired
and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place
once or twice as well as i remember replied sancho
for i know not what i am so focile means
and submit to what i teach thee i would bet said sancho that from the very first you understood me and knew what i meant but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders may be so replied don quixote
but to come to the point what does teresa say teresa says
and so say i said don quixote continue sancho my friend go on you talk pearls to day the fact is continued sancho
and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than god may be pleased to give him
and that the same he paid me out of your estate for i dont care to stand on rewards which either come late or ill or never at all god help me with my own
and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost
and so well understood returned don quixote that i have seen into the depths of thy thoughts and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs
please to return to my service well and good but to suppose that i am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight errantry is all nonsense and so my sancho get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your teresa
bene quidem if not we remain friends for if the pigeon house does not lack food it will not lack pigeons and bear in mind my son that a good hope is better than a bad holding and a good grievance better than a bad compensation
and in short i mean to say and i do say that if you dont like to come on reward with me and run the same chance that i run god be with you
the arch wag samson came forward and embracing him as he had done before said with a loud voice o flower of knight errantry o shining light of arms o honour and mirror of the spanish nation
may god almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons who would impede or hinder thy third sally may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes nor ever accomplish what they most desire and then turning to the housekeeper he said
for i know it is the positive determination of the spheres that senor don quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs and i should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did i not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit
any longer curbed and checked for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs
of the honour of virgins of the aid of widows and of the support of wives and other matters of this kind appertaining belonging proper and peculiar
on then my lord don quixote beautiful and brave let your worship and highness set out to day rather than to morrow and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose
with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight errants squire but heaven forbid that to gratify my own inclination i should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts
let this new samson remain in his own country and bringing honour to it bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents for i will be content with any squire that comes to hand as sancho does not deign to accompany me
the bread eaten and the company dispersed
who the panzas from whom i am descended were and what is more i know and have learned
no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants but after all a man must be a man and a woman a woman and as i am a man anyhow which i cant deny i will be one in my own house too let who will take it amiss
and so theres nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it cant be provoked
so i offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally as well and better than all the squires that served knights errant in times past or present
as he was there described but now hearing him talk of a will and codicil that could not be provoked instead of will and codicil that could not be revoked
in fine don quixote and sancho embraced one another and made friends and by the advice and with the approval of the great carrasco who was now their oracle it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence by which time they could have
all that was requisite for the journey ready and procure a closed helmet which don quixote said he must by all means take samson offered him one as he knew a friend of his
poured out on the bachelor were past counting they tore their hair they clawed their faces and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion
samsons intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on
with whom he had previously discussed the subject
his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals and his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies samson embraced him and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes so that he might rejoice over the former
in which is related the adventure of the enamoured shepherd together with other truly droll incidents don quixote had gone but a short distance beyond don diegos village when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students and a couple of peasants
and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw don quixote for the first time and were dying to know who this man so different from ordinary men could be don quixote saluted them and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his
made them an offer of his company and begged them to slacken their pace as their young asses travelled faster than his horse and then to gratify them he told them in a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed
which was that of a knight errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world he informed them that his own name was don quixote of la mancha and that he was called by way of surname the knight of the lions all this was greek or gibberish to the peasants
for all that however they regarded him with admiration and respect and one of them said to him if you sir knight have no fixed road as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any let your worship come with us
who is called par excellence
as the bridegroom is called camacho the rich she is eighteen and he twenty two and they are fairly matched though some knowing ones who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart will have it that the family of the fair quiteria is better than camachos
but no one minds that now a days for wealth can solder a great many flaws at any rate camacho is free handed
he has provided dancers too not only sword but also bell dancers for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection of shoe dancers i say nothing for of them he has engaged a host but none of these things
nor of the many others i have omitted to mention
and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents
so that the loves of the two children basilio and quiteria
he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich camacho
who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature for if the truth be told ungrudgingly he is the most agile youth we know a mighty thrower of the bar a first rate wrestler and a great ball player he runs like a deer and leaps better than a goat
bowls over the nine pins as if by magic
and above all handles a sword as well as the best
say that to my wife said sancho who had until now listened in silence for she wont hear of anything but each one marrying his equal holding with the proverb each ewe to her like
if all those who love one another were to marry said don quixote it would deprive parents of the right to choose and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased
one would be for choosing her fathers servant and another some one she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing though he may be a drunken bully
and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error
why then should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting place of death more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed at board and everywhere as the wife is to her husband
he has never been seen to smile or heard to utter rational word and he always goes about moody and dejected talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses he eats little and sleeps little and all he eats is fruit and when he sleeps
if he sleeps at all it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast sometimes he gazes at the sky
that he might be taken for a clothed statue with its drapery stirred by the wind in short he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering that all we who know him
and any one of them or any moment the house may fall i have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at one time
and tell me is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune no faith and between a womans yes and no i wouldnt venture to put the point of a pin
for love i have heard say
poverty wealth and blear eyes pearls what art thou driving at sancho curses on thee said don quixote
no one can understand thee but judas himself and i wish he had thee tell me thou animal what dost thou know about nails or wheels or anything else oh if you dont understand me replied sancho it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense
but no matter i understand myself and i know i have not said anything very foolish in what i have said only your worship senor is always gravelling at everything i say nay everything i do
maybe there are toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk that is true said the licentiate for those who have been bred up in the tanneries
and yet they are all toledans pure correct
though they may have been born in majalahonda i say of discrimination because there are many who are not so and discrimination is the grammar of good language if it be accompanied by practice i sirs for my sins have studied canon law at salamanca
where you are now tail look here bachelor corchuelo returned the licentiate you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword if you think it useless it is no idea on my part but an established truth
and these joined with my resolution which is not small will make you confess that i am not mistaken dismount and put in practice your positions and circles and angles and science for i hope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship
who will make me turn my back and that there is not one in the world i will not compel to give ground as to whether you turn your back or not i do not concern myself replied the master of fence
though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time i mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword
but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiates sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset and made him kiss it as if it were a relic though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed
the end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short cassock he wore tore the skirts into strips like the tails of a cuttlefish knocked off his hat twice and so completely tired him out
that in vexation anger and rage he took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force that one of the peasants that were there who was a notary and who went for it made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly three quarters of a league
by my faith senor bachelor if your worship takes my advice you will never challenge anyone to fence again only to wrestle and throw the bar for you have the youth and strength for that but as for these fencers as they call them i have heard say
they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle i am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey said corchuelo and with having had the truth i was so ignorant of proved to me by experience and getting up he embraced the licentiate
and they were better friends than ever and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of quiteria to which they all belonged in good time during the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on the excellences of the sword with such conclusive arguments and such figures and mathematical proofs
it grew dark but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it they heard too the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments flutes drums
psalteries pipes
were filled with lights unaffected by the wind for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees the musicians were the life of the wedding wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands some dancing
others singing others playing the various instruments already mentioned
were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow
even were it under gilded ceilings and so turned aside a little out of the road
as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of don diego came back to his mind
wherein an account is given of the wedding of camacho the rich together with the incident of basilio the poor
scarce had the fair aurora given bright phoebus time to dry the liquid pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays when don quixote shaking off sloth from his limbs
sprang to his feet and called to his squire sancho who was still snoring
that without envying or being envied sleepest
to interfere with thy repose ambition breaks not thy rest nor doth this worlds empty pomp disturb thee for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass
since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the support of thyself the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom have imposed upon masters the servant sleeps and the master lies awake thinking how he is to feed him advance him and reward him
he awoke at last drowsy and lazy and casting his eyes about in every direction observed there comes if i dont mistake
a wedding that begins with smells like that by my faith ought to be plentiful and unstinting have done thou glutton said don quixote come let us go and witness this bridal and see what the rejected basilio does
let him do what he likes returned sancho be he not poor he would marry quiteria to make a grand match for himself and he without a farthing is there nothing else faith
senor its my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get
and if that be so as no doubt it is
but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash i wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are
for gods sake sancho said don quixote here
one of them was that i was to be let say all i liked so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worships authority and so far it seems to me i have not broken the said article
and even if it were so i desire you to hold your tongue and come along for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning and not in the heat of the afternoon
and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots for they were six half wine jars each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter house
they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons
of over six gallons each and all filled as it proved afterwards with generous wines there were besides piles of the whitest bread like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing floors
there was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick work and two cauldrons full of oil
and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by of cooks and cook maids there were over fifty all clean brisk and blithe in the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking pigs which sewn up there
the spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter and all lay open to view in a great chest
but abundant enough to feed an army
contemplated all and everything won his heart the first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots
get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two and much good may they do you i dont see one said sancho wait a bit said the cook sinner that i am how particular and bashful you are
and so saying he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese
fall to friend and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner time comes
well then said the cook take spoon and all for camachos wealth and happiness furnish everything
don quixote was watching the entrance at one end of the arcade of some twelve peasants all in holiday and gala dress
a fight that won friends the thing which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did the martians i had seen held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot
while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behind me this other which was evidently its mate soon came toward us bearing a mighty stone cudgel
with which it evidently intended to brain me the creatures were about ten or fifteen feet tall standing erect and had like the green martians an intermediary set of arms or legs
midway between their upper and lower limbs their eyes were close together and non protruding their ears were high set but more laterally located than those of the martians
when a bolt of myriad legged horror hurled itself through the doorway full upon the breast of my executioner with a shriek of fear the ape which held me leaped through the open window but its mate closed in a terrific
death struggle with my preserver which was nothing less than my faithful watch thing i cannot bring myself to call so hideous a creature a dog as quickly as possible i gained my feet and backing against the wall i witnessed such a
battle as it is vouchsafed few beings to see the strength agility and blind ferocity of these two creatures is approached by nothing known to earthly man
my beast had an advantage in his first hold having sunk his mighty fangs far into the breast of his adversary but the great arms and paws of the ape
backed by muscles far transcending those of the martian men i had seen had locked the throat of my guardian and slowly were choking out his life and bending back his head and neck upon his body
where i momentarily expected the former to fall limp at the end of a broken neck in accomplishing this the ape was tearing away the entire front of its breast which was held in the vise like grip of the powerful jaws
back and forth upon the floor they rolled neither one emitting a sound of fear or pain presently i saw the great eyes of my beast bulging completely from their sockets and blood flowing from its nostrils
but so also was the ape whose struggles were growing momentarily less suddenly i came to myself
i seized the cudgel which had fallen to the floor at the commencement of the battle and swinging it with all the power of my earthly arms i crashed it full upon the head of the ape crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell
scarcely had the blow descended when i was confronted with a new danger the apes mate recovered from its first shock of terror had returned to the scene of the encounter by way of the interior of the building
i glimpsed him just before he reached the doorway and the sight of him now roaring as he perceived his lifeless fellow stretched upon the floor and frothing at the mouth in the extremity of his rage filled me i must confess
with dire forebodings i am ever willing to stand and fight when the odds are not too overwhelmingly against me but in this instance i perceived neither glory nor profit
against the iron muscles and brutal ferocity of this enraged denizen of an unknown world in fact the only outcome of such an encounter so far as i might be concerned seemed sudden death
i was standing near the window and i knew that once in the street i might gain the plaza and safety before the creature could overtake me at least there was a chance for safety in flight
against almost certain death should i remain and fight however desperately it is true i held the cudgel but what could i do with it against his four great arms
even should i break one of them with my first blow for i figured that he would attempt to ward off the cudgel he could reach out and annihilate me with the others before i could recover for a second attack
in the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind i had turned to make for the window but my eyes alighting on the form of my erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds he lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber
his great eyes fastened upon me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection i could not withstand that look nor could i on second thought have deserted my rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf
as he had in mine without more ado therefore i turned to meet the charge of the infuriated bull ape he was now too close upon me for the cudgel to prove of any effective assistance
so i merely threw it as heavily as i could at his advancing bulk it struck him just below the knees eliciting a howl of pain and rage and so throwing him off his balance that he lunged full upon me
with arms wide stretched to ease his fall again as on the preceding day i had recourse to earthly tactics and swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin
i beheld tars tarkas sola and three or four warriors standing in the doorway of the chamber as my eyes met theirs i was for the second time the recipient of their zealously guarded applause
my absence had been noted by sola on her awakening and she had quickly informed tars tarkas who had set out immediately with a handful of warriors to search for me as they had approached the limits of the city
this encounter together with my set to with the martian warrior on the previous day and my feats of jumping placed me upon a high pinnacle in their regard evidently devoid of all the finer sentiments of friendship
love or affection these people fairly worship physical prowess and bravery and nothing is too good for the object of their adoration as long as he maintains his position by repeated examples of his skill
strength and courage sola who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition was the only one of the martians whose face had not been twisted in laughter as i battled for my life she on the contrary
was sober with apparent solicitude and as soon as i had finished the monster rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds or injuries satisfying herself that i had come off unscathed she smiled quietly
and taking my hand started toward the door of the chamber tars tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing over the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life
they seemed to be deep in argument and finally one of them addressed me but remembering my ignorance of his language turned back to tars tarkas who with a word and gesture gave some command to the fellow
and turned to follow us from the room there seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast and i hesitated to leave until i had learned the outcome it was well i did so for the warrior drew an
evil looking pistol from its holster and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when i sprang forward and struck up his arm the bullet striking the wooden casing of the window exploded
blowing a hole completely through the wood and masonry i then knelt down beside the fearsome looking thing and raising it to its feet motioned for it to follow me
and sola grasping me tightly by the arm i had at least two friends on mars a young woman who watched over me with motherly solicitude and a dumb brute which as i later came to know
held in its poor ugly carcass more love more loyalty more gratitude
chapter eighteen chained in warhoon it must have been several hours before i regained consciousness
and bending over me was an ancient and ugly female as i opened my eyes she turned to one of the warriors saying he will live o jed tis well replied the one so addressed
rising and approaching my couch he should render rare sport for the great games and now as my eyes fell upon him i saw that he was no thark for his ornaments and metal were not of that horde
he was a huge fellow terribly scarred about the face and chest and with one broken tusk and a missing ear
and depending from these a number of dried human hands his reference to the great games of which i had heard so much while among the tharks convinced me that i had but jumped from purgatory into gehenna
after a few more words with the female during which she assured him that i was now fully fit to travel the jed ordered that we mount and ride after the main column
i was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as i had ever seen and with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent the beast from bolting
we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of the column my wounds gave me but little pain so wonderfully and rapidly had the applications and injections of the female exercised their therapeutic powers
who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of warhoon like the jed who had brought me he was frightfully scarred and also decorated with the breastplate of human skulls and dried dead hands
which seemed to mark all the greater warriors among the warhoons as well as to indicate their awful ferocity which greatly transcends even that of the tharks the jeddak bar comas who was comparatively young
was the object of the fierce and jealous hatred of his old lieutenant dak kova the jed who had captured me and i could not but note the almost studied efforts which the latter made to affront his superior
he entirely omitted the usual formal salutation as we entered the presence of the jeddak and as he pushed me roughly before the ruler he exclaimed in a loud and menacing voice
i have brought a strange creature wearing the metal of a thark whom it is my pleasure to have battle with a wild thoat at the great games he will die as bar comas your jeddak sees fit if at all
with emphasis and dignity if at all roared dak kova by the dead hands at my throat but he shall die bar comas no maudlin weakness on your part shall save him
rather than by a water hearted weakling from whom even old dak kova could tear the metal with his bare hands bar comas eyed the defiant and insubordinate chieftain for an instant his expression one of haughty
fearless contempt and hate and then without drawing a weapon and without uttering a word he hurled himself at the throat of his defamer
i never before had seen two green martian warriors battle with natures weapons and the exhibition of animal ferocity which ensued was as fearful a thing as the most disordered imagination could picture
bar comas had much the better of the battle as he was stronger quicker and more intelligent it soon seemed that the encounter was done saving only the final death thrust when bar comas slipped in
breaking away from a clinch it was the one little opening that dak kova needed and hurling himself at the body of his adversary
and with a last powerful effort ripped the young jeddak wide open the full length of his body the great tusk
victor and vanquished rolled limp and lifeless upon the moss a huge mass of torn and bloody flesh
bar comas was stone dead and only the most herculean efforts on the part of dak kovas females saved him from the fate he deserved three days later he walked without assistance to the body of bar comas which
by custom had not been moved from where it fell and placing his foot upon the neck of his erstwhile ruler he assumed the title of jeddak of warhoon
the injuries to dak kova had delayed the march so greatly that it was decided to give up the expedition which was a raid upon a small thark community in retaliation for the destruction of the incubator until after the great games
they are a smaller horde than the tharks but much more ferocious
food was brought me at intervals but owing to the utter darkness of the place i do not know whether i lay there days or weeks or months it was the most horrible experience of all my life
and that my mind did not give way to the terrors of that inky blackness has been a wonder to me ever since the place was filled with creeping crawling things cold sinuous bodies passed over me when i lay down
and in the darkness i occasionally caught glimpses of gleaming fiery eyes fixed in horrible intentness upon me no sound reached me from the world above and no word would my jailer vouchsafe when my food was brought to me
although i at first bombarded him with questions finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful creatures who had placed me in this horrible place was centered by my tottering reason upon this single emissary
who represented to me the entire horde of warhoons i had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where he could place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it upon the floor
so with the cunning of a madman i backed into the far corner of my cell when next i heard him approaching
i waited his coming crouching like some beast of prey as he stooped to place my food upon the ground i swung the chain above my head and crashed the links with all my strength upon his skull without a sound
he slipped to the floor stone dead laughing and chattering like the idiot i was fast becoming
no longer was i a jibbering idiot but a sane reasoning man with the means of escape within my very hands as i was groping to remove the chain from about my victims neck
back into my corner i crouched
and stealthily on came the awful eyes until they reached the dead body at my feet then slowly they retreated but this time with a strange grating sound
the looting of zodanga as the great gate where i stood swung open my fifty tharks headed by tars tarkas himself rode in upon their mighty thoats i led them to the palace walls
which i negotiated easily without assistance once inside however the gate gave me considerable trouble
and soon my fierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of zodanga as we approached the palace i could see through the great windows of the first floor into the brilliantly illuminated audience chamber of than kosis
the immense hall was crowded with nobles and their women as though some important function was in progress there was not a guard in sight without the palace due i presume to the fact that the city and palace walls were considered impregnable
and so i came close and peered within at one end of the chamber upon massive golden thrones encrusted with diamonds sat than kosis and his consort
surrounded by officers and dignitaries of state before them stretched a broad aisle lined on either side with soldiery and as i looked there entered this aisle at the far end of the hall
the head of a procession which advanced to the foot of the throne first there marched four officers of the jeddaks guard bearing a huge salver on which reposed upon a cushion of scarlet silk
at the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle then came more dignitaries and the officers of the palace and of the army and finally
two figures entirely muffled in scarlet silk so that not a feature of either was discernible these two stopped at the foot of the throne facing than kosis when the balance of the procession had entered and assumed their stations
than kosis addressed the couple standing before him i could not hear his words but presently two officers advanced and removed the scarlet robe from one of the figures and i saw that kantos kan had failed in his mission
for it was sab than prince of zodanga who stood revealed before me than kosis now took a set of the ornaments from one of the salvers and placed one of the collars of gold about his sons neck
springing the padlock fast after a few more words addressed to sab than he turned to the other figure from which the officers now removed the enshrouding silks disclosing to my now comprehending view
but to me it seemed the most fiendish sight i had ever witnessed and as the ornaments were adjusted upon her beautiful figure and her collar of gold swung open in the hands of than kosis i raised my long sword above my head
i brought my long sword down upon the golden chain that would have bound dejah thoris to another in an instant all was confusion a thousand drawn swords menaced me from every quarter
rode tars tarkas and his fifty warriors on their great thoats a cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage but no word of fear and in a moment the soldiers and nobles of zodanga
with drawn long sword in an instant we were engaged and i found no mean antagonist as we circled upon the broad platform i saw sab than rushing up the steps to aid his father
but as he raised his hand to strike dejah thoris sprang before him and then my sword found the spot that made sab than jeddak of zodanga
and again we faced each other he was soon joined by a quartet of officers and with my back against a golden throne i fought once again for dejah thoris i was hard pressed to defend myself
and with him my last chance to win the woman i loved my blade was swinging with the rapidity of lightning as i sought to parry the thrusts and cuts of my opponents two i had disarmed and one was down
when several more rushed to the aid of their new ruler and to avenge the death of the old as they advanced there were cries of the woman the woman strike her down it is her plot kill her kill her
calling to dejah thoris to get behind me i worked my way toward the little doorway back of the throne but the officers realized my intentions and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position
the tharks were having their hands full in the center of the room
when i saw tars tarkas surging through the crowd of pygmies that swarmed about him with one swing of his mighty longsword he laid a dozen corpses at his feet
not one attempted to escape and when the fighting ceased it was because only tharks remained alive in the great hall other than dejah thoris and myself sab than lay dead beside his father
and the corpses of the flower of zodangan nobility and chivalry covered the floor of the bloody shambles my first thought when the battle was over was for kantos kan
and leaving dejah thoris in charge of tars tarkas i took a dozen warriors and hastened to the dungeons beneath the palace the jailers had all left to join the fighters in the throne room so we searched the labyrinthine prison without opposition
i called kantos kans name aloud in each new corridor and compartment and finally i was rewarded by hearing a faint response guided by the sound we soon found him helpless in a dark recess
he was overjoyed at seeing me and to know the meaning of the fight faint echoes of which had reached his prison cell he told me that the air patrol had captured him before he reached the high tower of the palace
so that he had not even seen sab than we discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut away the bars and chains which held him prisoner so at his suggestion
fortunately among the first i examined i found his jailer and soon we had kantos kan with us in the throne room the sounds of heavy firing mingled with shouts and cries came to us from the citys streets
and tars tarkas hastened away to direct the fighting without kantos kan accompanied him to act as guide the green warriors commencing a thorough search of the palace for other zodangans and for loot and dejah thoris and i were left alone
can it be that all earth men are as you alone a stranger hunted threatened persecuted you have done in a few short months what in all the past ages of barsoom no man has ever done
joined together the wild hordes of the sea bottoms and brought them to fight as allies of a red martian people the answer is easy dejah thoris i replied smiling it was not i who did it it was love
love for dejah thoris a power that would work greater miracles than this you have seen a pretty flush overspread her face and she answered you may say that now john carter and i may listen
for i am free and more still i have to say ere it is again too late i returned i have done many strange things in my life many things that wiser men would not have dared
but never in my wildest fancies have i dreamed of winning a dejah thoris for myself for never had i dreamed that in all the universe dwelt such a woman as the princess of helium
but that you are you is enough to make me doubt my sanity as i ask you my princess to be mine he does not need to be abashed who so well knew the answer to his plea
before the plea were made she replied rising and placing her dear hands upon my shoulders and so i took her in my arms and kissed her and thus in the midst of a city of wild conflict filled with the alarms of war
with death and destruction reaping their terrible harvest around her did dejah thoris princess of helium true daughter of mars the god of war promise herself in marriage to john carter
the council of buccaneers had lasted some time when one of them re entered the house and with a repetition of the same salute which had in my eyes an ironical air begged for a moments loan of the torch silver briefly agreed
and this emissary retired again leaving us together in the dark theres a breeze coming jim said silver who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out
the embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch about half way down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a group
one held the light another was on his knees in their midst and i saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight
i could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet
and the whole party began to move together towards the house here they come said i and i returned to my former position for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them well let em come lad let em come
ive still a shot in my locker the door opened and the five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one of their number forward in any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance
hesitating as he set down each foot but holding his closed right hand in front of him step up lad cried silver i wont eat you
youll all swing now i reckon what soft headed lubber had a bible it was dick said one dick was it then dick can get to prayers said silver
hes seen his slice of luck has dick and you may lay to that but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in
well what is it anyway ah deposed thats it is it very pretty wrote to be sure like print i swear your hand o write george
youll be capn next i shouldnt wonder just oblige me with that torch again will you this pipe dont draw
youre a funny man by your account but youre over now and youll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote i thought you said you knowed the rules returned silver contemptuously
oh replied george you dont be under no kind of apprehension were all square we are first youve made a hash of this cruise youll be a bold man to say no to that second
you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing why did they want out
third you wouldnt let us go at them upon the march
you want to play booty thats whats wrong with you and then fourth theres this here boy is that all asked silver quietly enough too retorted george
well all swing and sun dry for your bungling
i made a hash o this cruise did i well now you all know what i wanted and you all know if that had been done that wed a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plum duff
and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder well who crossed me
ah its a fine dance im with you there and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a ropes end at execution dock by london town it does but who done it why it was anderson and hands and you george merry
and youre the last above board of that same meddling crew and you have the davy joness insolence to up and stand for capn over me you that sank the lot of us
but this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing silver paused and i could see by the faces of george and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain thats for number one
cried the accused wiping the sweat from his brow for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house
speak up to the others ah the others returned john theyre a nice lot aint they you say this cruise is bungled ah by gum if you could understand how bad its bungled you would see
were that near the gibbet that my necks stiff with thinking on it youve seen em maybe hanged in chains birds about em
whos that says one that why thats john silver i knowed him well says another and you can hear the chains a jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy
now thats about where we are every mothers son of us thanks to him and hands and anderson and other ruination fools of you
are we a going to waste a hostage no not us
kill that boy not me mates and number three ah well theres a deal to say to number three maybe you dont count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day you john with your head broke
but thats a trifle you look there thats why and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly recognized none other than the chart on yellow paper
the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse it went from hand to hand one tearing it from another and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination
but were at sea with it besides in safety yes said one thats flint sure enough j f and a score below with a clove hitch to it so he done ever
mighty pretty said george but how are we to get away with it and us no ship silver suddenly sprang up and supporting himself with a hand against the wall
now i give you warning george he cried one more word of your sauce and ill call you down and fight you how why how do i know
but civil you can speak and shall george merry you may lay to that
so thats the toon is it cried the cook george i reckon youll have to wait another turn friend and lucky for you as im not a revengeful man but
and now shipmates this black spot taint much good now is it dicks crossed his luck and spoiled his bible and thats about all itll do to kiss the book on still wont it growled dick who was evidently
a bible with a bit cut out returned silver derisively not it
dont it though cried dick with a sort of joy well i reckon thats worth having too here jim heres a curosity for you said silver and he tossed me the paper
one side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of revelation these words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind without are dogs and murderers
the printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed
i have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumb nail that was the end of the nights business
it was long ere i could close an eye and heaven knows i had matter enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon
and above all in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged upon keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life
he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet
there never was such an overturn in this world each of these six men was as though he had been struck
every thought of his soul had been set full stretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment
here is a narrow corner as
his looks were not quite friendly and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering so youve changed sides again there was no time left for him to answer in
and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so morgan found a piece of gold he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths it was a two guinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute
two guineas roared merry shaking it at silver
youre him that never bungled nothing you wooden headed lubber dig away boys said silver with the coolest insolence youll find some pig nuts and i shouldnt wonder pig nuts repeated merry in a scream mates do you hear that
ah merry remarked silver standing for capn again youre a pushing lad to be sure but this time everyone was entirely in merrys favour they began to scramble out of the excavation
darting furious glances behind them one thing i observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from silver well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us
and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever i saw him he was brave and no mistake
at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters
ones the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the others that cub that i mean to have the heart of now mates
and plainly meant to lead a charge but just then crack crack crack three musket shots flashed out of the thicket merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation
the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might
before you could wink long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony george said he
sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us the work that man went through
was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor as it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope doctor he hailed see there
no hurry sure enough there was no hurry in a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started
we were already between them and the boats
came slowly up with us thank ye kindly doctor says he you came in in about the nick i guess for me and hawkins
im ben gunn i am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment and he added after a long pause how do mister silver pretty well i thank ye says you
ben ben murmured silver to think as youve done me the doctor sent back gray for one of the pick axes deserted in their flight by the mutineers
ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeleton it was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pick axe that lay broken in the excavation
he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two pointed hill at the north east angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months
given him the stores for ben gunns cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himself given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two pointed hill there to be clear of malaria
and keep a guard upon the money as for you jim he said it went against my heart
and leaving the squire to guard the captain had taken gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and ben gunn being fleet of foot
had been dispatched in front to do his best alone then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates
not a thought replied doctor livesey cheerily and by this time we had reached the gigs
this was a run of eight or nine miles silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea
and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket it was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any three miles farther just inside the mouth of north inlet
what should we meet but the hispaniola cruising by herself the last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help
another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water we all pulled round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunns treasure house and then gray single handed returned with the gig to the hispaniola
where he was to pass the night on guard a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave at the top the squire met us
to me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise at silvers polite salute he somewhat flushed john silver
replied long john again saluting i dare you to thank me cried the squire it is a gross dereliction of my duty stand back and thereupon we all entered the cave
it was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns the floor was sand before a big fire lay captain smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze
i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold that was flints treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola
how many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty
perhaps no man alive could tell yet there were still three upon that island silver and old morgan and ben gunn who had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward
come in jim said the captain youre a good boy in your line jim but i dont think you and mell go to sea again youre too much of the born favourite for me
and what a meal it was with ben gunns salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola never i am sure were people gayer or happier
the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting
therefore the work was pushed on briskly gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences
two of the bars slung in a ropes end made a good load for a grown man one that he was glad to walk slowly with for my part
the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spiders web
nearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out
at last i think it was on the third night the doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle
the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers
all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent
indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn
who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else
for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him drunk or raving said he right you were sir replied silver
and precious little odds which to you and me i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver
but if i were sure they were raving as i am morally certain one at least of them is down with fever i should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill
no said the doctor youre the man to keep your word we know that well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting
a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the island to the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat
a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco that was about our last doing on the island
and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny
and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for gods sake
leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silvers head
after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance that was at least the end of that
and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand
only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands
and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land locked gulf
the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore
to pass the early part of the night here they met the captain of an english man of war fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola
silver was gone the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago
that man with the one leg had stayed aboard but this was not all the sea cook had not gone empty handed he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin
worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him
well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mister blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort five men only of those who had sailed returned with her
as that other ship they sang about with one man of her crew alive what put to sea with seventy five all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures
captain smollett is now retired from the sea gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full rigged ship
married besides and the father of a family as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth
of silver we have heard no more that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life
and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small the bar silver
and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me
and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my ears
i would here willingly have proceeded to exhibit the whole chain of truths which i deduced from these primary but as with a view to this it would have been necessary now to treat of many questions
i believe that it will be better for me to refrain from this exposition and only mention in general what these truths are that the more judicious may be able to determine whether a more special account of them would conduce to the public advantage
i have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which i have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of god and of the soul
and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared and yet i venture to state that not only have i found means
to satisfy myself in a short time on all the principal difficulties which are usually treated of in philosophy but i have also observed certain laws established in nature by god in such a manner
and of which he has impressed on our minds such notions that after we have reflected sufficiently upon these we cannot doubt that they are accurately observed in all that exists or takes place in the world and farther by considering
but like the painters who finding themselves unable to represent equally well on a plain surface all the different faces of a solid body select one of the chief on which alone they make the light fall and throwing the rest into the shade
fearing lest i should not be able to compense in my discourse all that was in my mind i resolved to expound singly though at considerable length my opinions regarding light then
to take the opportunity of adding something on the sun and the fixed stars since light almost wholly proceeds from them on the heavens since they transmit it on the planets comets and earth since they reflect it and particularly
on all the bodies that are upon the earth since they are either colored or transparent or luminous and finally on man since he is the spectator of these objects
further to enable me to cast this variety of subjects somewhat into the shade and to express my judgment regarding them with greater freedom without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned
i resolved to leave all the people here to their disputes and to speak only of what would happen in a new world if god were now to create somewhere in the imaginary spaces
matter sufficient to compose one and were to agitate variously and confusedly the different parts of this matter so that there resulted a chaos as disordered as the poets ever feigned
and after that did nothing more than lend his ordinary concurrence to nature and allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had established on this supposition i in the first place described this matter
and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible except what has been recently said regarding god and the soul
for i even expressly supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are so debated in the schools nor in general anything the knowledge of which is not so natural to our minds
i endeavored to demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt
that even if god had created more worlds there could have been none in which these laws were not observed thereafter i showed how the greatest part of the matter of this chaos must in accordance with these laws dispose and arrange itself in such a way
as to present the appearance of heavens how in the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets and comets and others a sun and fixed stars and making a digression at this stage on the subject of light
i expounded at considerable length what the nature of that light must be
and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the immense spaces of the heavens and how from the planets and comets it is reflected towards the earth to this i likewise added much respecting the substance the situation the motions
and all the different qualities of these heavens and stars so that i thought i had said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in the heavens or stars of our system that must not or at least may not appear precisely alike in those of the system which i described
i came next to speak of the earth in particular and to show how even though i had expressly supposed that god had given no weight to the matter of which it is composed this should not prevent all its parts from tending exactly
to that observed in our seas as also a certain current both of water and air from east to west such as is likewise observed between the tropics how the mountains seas fountains and rivers might naturally be formed in it
and the metals produced in the mines and the plants grow in the fields and in general how all the bodies which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated and among other things in the discoveries alluded to
i knew nothing except fire which produces light i spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature the manner of its production and support and to explain how heat is sometimes found without light and light without heat
to show how it can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse qualities how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others how it can consume almost all bodies or convert them into ashes and smoke
and finally how from these ashes
for as this transmutation of ashes into glass appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature i took a special pleasure in describing it i was not however disposed from these circumstances
to conclude that this world had been created in the manner i described
but this is certain and an opinion commonly received among theologians that the action by which he now sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it
so that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form than that of chaos provided only he had established certain laws of nature and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is wont to do
it may be believed without discredit to the miracle of creation that in this way alone things purely material might in course of time
from the description of inanimate bodies and plants i passed to animals and particularly to man
but since i had not as yet sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner as of the rest that is to say by deducing effects from their causes and by showing
nature must produce them i remained satisfied with the supposition that god formed the body of man wholly like to one of ours as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs
of the same matter with that i had described and at first placed in it no rational soul nor any other principle in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light
and which i thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit for when i examined the kind of functions which might
as consequences of this supposition exist in this body i found precisely all those which may exist in us independently
consists in thinking functions in which the animals void of reason may be said wholly to resemble us but among which i could not discover any of those that as dependent on thought alone belong to us as men
while on the other hand i did afterwards discover these as soon as i supposed god to have created a rational soul and to have annexed it to this body in a particular manner which i described
will afford the means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest
to take the trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large animal possessed of lungs
and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities in the first place that in the right side with which correspond two very ample tubes viz the hollow vein vena cava
which is the principal receptacle of the blood and the trunk of the tree as it were of which all the other veins in the body are branches and the arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately so denominated
presently disperse themselves all over the lungs in the second place the cavity in the left side
two canals in size equal to or larger than the preceding viz the venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated because it is simply a vein which comes from the lungs
where it is divided into many branches interlaced with those of the arterial vein and those of the tube called the windpipe through which the air we breathe enters and the great artery which issuing from the heart sends its branches all over the body
i should wish also that such persons were carefully shown the eleven pellicles which like so many small valves open and shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities viz
three at the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from flowing into the right ventricle of the heart and yet exactly to prevent its flowing out three at the entrance to the arterial vein
which arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former readily permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs but hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity and in like manner
two others at the mouth of the venous artery which allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the heart but preclude its return and three at the mouth of the great artery which suffer the blood to flow from the heart
but prevent its reflux nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being of an oval shape from the nature of its situation can be adequately closed with two
whereas the others being round are more conveniently closed with three besides i wish such persons to observe that the grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer texture
and there form as it were two pouches denominated the auricles of the heart which are composed of a substance similar to that of the heart itself and that there is always more warmth in the heart than in any other part of the body
and finally that this heat is capable of causing any drop of blood that passes into the cavities rapidly to expand and dilate just as all liquors do when allowed to fall drop by drop into a highly heated vessel
for after these things it is not necessary for me to say anything more with a view to explain the motion of the heart except that when its cavities are not full of blood
into these the blood of necessity flows from the hollow vein into the right and from the venous artery into the left because these two vessels are always full of blood and their orifices which are turned towards the heart cannot then be closed
because the orifices through which they pass are wide
are immediately rarefied and dilated by the heat they meet with in this way they cause the whole heart to expand and at the same time press home and shut the five small valves that are at the entrances
of the two vessels from which they flow and thus prevent any more blood from coming down into the heart and becoming more and more rarefied they push open the six small valves that are in the orifices of the other two vessels through which they pass out
causing in this way all the branches of the arterial vein and of the grand artery to expand almost simultaneously with the heart which immediately thereafter begins to contract as do also the arteries
and the six small valves close and the five of the hollow
venous artery open anew and allow a passage
which cause the heart and the arteries again to expand as before and because the blood which thus enters into the heart passes
it thence happens that their motion is the contrary of that of the heart and that when it expands they contract but lest those who are ignorant of the force of mathematical demonstrations and who are not accustomed to distinguish
true reasons from mere verisimilitudes should venture without examination to deny what has been said i wish it to be considered that the motion which i have now explained follows as necessarily
from the very arrangement of the parts which may be observed in the heart by the eye alone and from the heat which may be felt with the fingers and from the nature of the blood as learned from experience as does the motion of a clock from the power
the situation and shape of its counterweights and wheels but if it be asked how it happens that the blood in the veins flowing in this way continually into the heart is not exhausted
and of having been the first to teach that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood received by them from the heart passes into the small branches of the veins
so that its course amounts precisely to a perpetual circulation of this we have abundant proof in the ordinary experience of surgeons who by binding the arm with a tie of moderate straitness above the part where they open the vein
cause the blood to flow more copiously than it would have done without any ligature whereas quite the contrary would happen were they to bind it below that is between the hand and the opening or were to make the ligature above
the opening very tight for it is manifest that the tie moderately straightened while adequate to hinder the blood already in the arm from returning towards the heart by the veins cannot on that account prevent new blood
from coming forward through the arteries because these are situated below the veins and their coverings from their greater consistency are more difficult to compress and also that the blood which comes from the heart tends to pass through them
to the hand with greater force than it does to return from the hand to the heart through the veins and since the latter current escapes from the arm by the opening made in one of the veins there must of necessity
which is in the body may flow out of it in a very short time through a single artery that has been cut
so as to prevent the supposition that the blood flowing out of it could come from any other quarter than the heart but there are many other circumstances which evince that what i have alleged
is the true cause of the motion of the blood thus in the first place the difference that is observed between the blood which flows from the veins and that from the arteries can only arise from this
and more vivid and warmer immediately after leaving the heart in other words when in the arteries than it was a short time before passing into either in other words when it was in the veins
and if attention be given it will be found that this difference is very marked only in the neighborhood of the heart
in parts more remote from it in the next place
sufficiently shows that the blood is impelled against them with more force than against the veins and why should the left cavity of the heart
and the arterial vein were it not that the blood of the venous artery having only been in the lungs after it has passed through the heart is thinner and rarefies more readily and in a higher degree
whence it happens that if the blood be withdrawn from any part the heat is likewise withdrawn by the same means and although the heart were as hot as glowing iron it would not be capable of warming the feet and hands
and that in children who cannot use them while in the womb
when it is considered that it is distilled by passing and repassing through the heart perhaps more than one or two hundred times in a day
and the production of the different humors of the body beyond saying that the force with which the blood in being rarefied passes from the heart towards the extremities of the arteries causes certain of its parts to remain in the members at which they arrive
and there occupy the place of some others expelled by them and that according to the situation shape or smallness of the pores with which they meet some rather than others flow into certain parts
which by being variously perforated serve to separate different species of grain and in the last place what above all is here worthy of observation
is the generation of the animal spirits which are like a very subtle wind or rather a very pure and vivid flame which
ascending in great abundance from the heart to the brain thence penetrates through the nerves into the muscles and gives motion to all the members so that to account for other parts of the blood which as most agitated and penetrating
proceeding towards the brain it is not necessary to suppose any other cause than simply that the arteries which carry them thither proceed from the heart
in the most direct lines and that according to the rules of mechanics which are the same with those of nature when many objects tend at once to the same point
which flow forth from the left cavity of the heart and tend towards the brain the weaker and less agitated parts must necessarily be driven aside from that point by the stronger which alone in this way reach it
i had expounded all these matters with sufficient minuteness in the treatise which i formerly thought of publishing and after these i had shown what must be the fabric of the nerves and muscles of the human body
to give the animal spirits contained in it the power to move the members as when we see heads shortly after they have been struck off still move and bite the earth although no longer animated what changes must take place in the brain to produce
waking sleep and dreams how light sounds odors tastes heat and all the other qualities of external objects impress it with different ideas by means of the senses how hunger
thirst and the other internal affections can likewise impress upon it divers ideas what must be understood by the common sense sensus communis in which these ideas are received by the memory which retains them
by the fantasy which can change them in various ways and out of them compose new ideas and which by the same means distributing the animal spirits through the muscles can cause the members of such a body to move in as many different ways
to those who are acquainted with the variety of movements performed by the different automata or moving machines fabricated by human industry and that with help of but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones
muscles nerves arteries veins and other parts that are found in the body of each animal such persons will look upon this body as a machine made by the hands of god which is incomparably better arranged
and adequate to movements more admirable than is any machine of human invention and here i specially stayed to show that were there such machines exactly resembling organs and outward form an ape or any other irrational animal
we could have no means of knowing that they were in any respect of a different nature from these animals but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies and capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible
our thoughts to others for we may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits vocables and even that it emits some correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs
for example if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish to say to it if in another it may cry out that it is hurt and such like
appositely to reply to what is said in its presence as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do the second test is that although such machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us
these organs on the contrary need a particular arrangement for each particular action whence it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient
that there are no men so dull and stupid not even idiots as to be incapable of joining together different words and thereby constructing a declaration by which to make their thoughts understood
destitute of the organs which others use in speaking are in the habit of spontaneously inventing certain signs by which they discover their thoughts to those who being usually in their company have leisure to learn their language
and this proves not only that the brutes have less reason than man but that they have none at all for we see that very little is required to enable a person to speak
and since a certain inequality of capacity is observable among animals of the same species as well as among men and since some are more capable of being instructed than others it is incredible that the most perfect ape or parrot of its species
should not in this be equal to the most stupid infant of its kind or at least to one that was crack brained unless the soul of brutes
and we ought not to confound speech with the natural movements which indicate the passions and can be imitated by machines as well as manifested by animals nor must it be thought with certain of the ancients that the brutes speak although we do not understand their language
since they are endowed with many organs analogous to ours they could as easily communicate their thoughts to us as to their fellows
that though there are many animals which manifest more industry than we in certain of their actions the same animals are yet observed to show none at all in many others so that the circumstance that they do better
and could surpass us in all things on the contrary it rather proves that they are destitute of reason and that it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs thus it is seen that a clock composed only of wheels and weights
can number the hours and measure time more exactly than we with all our skin i had after this described the reasonable soul and shown that it could by no means be educed from the power of matter
as the other things of which i had spoken but that it must be expressly created and that it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body exactly like a pilot in a ship unless perhaps to move its members
but that it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to the body in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours and thus constitute a real man
there is none that is more powerful in leading feeble minds astray from the straight path of virtue
and consequently that after this life we have nothing to hope for or fear more than flies and ants in place of which when we know how far they differ we much better comprehend the reasons which establish
because no other causes are observed capable of destroying it
he did not speak about it at length but said that he had written me a letter not to be opened until after his death containing instructions for publication this letter was dated thirtieth april
eighteen seventy six i will give here as much of it as concerns the public i wish you to accept as a gift from me given you now the accompanying pages which contain a memoir of my life
my intention is that they shall be published after my death and be edited by you but i leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted
but i would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir if you wish to say any word as from yourself let it be done in the shape of a preface or introductory chapter at the end there is a postscript
the publication if made at all should be effected as soon as possible after my death my father died on the sixth of december eighteen eighty two it will be seen therefore
that my duty has been merely to pass the book through the press conformably to the above instructions i have placed headings to the right hand pages throughout the book and i do not conceive that i was precluded from so doing
that he had given up hunting but he still kept two horses for such riding as may be had in or about the immediate neighbourhood of london he continued to ride to the end of his life he liked the exercise and i think it would have distressed him not to have had a horse in his stable
but he never spoke willingly on hunting matters he had at last resolved to give up his favourite amusement and that as far as he was concerned there should be an end of it in the spring of eighteen seventy seven he went to south africa
the journey lasted altogether sixteen days and during that time mister and missus burns were the hospitable entertainers when my father returned he wrote a short account of how the mastiffs went to iceland
the book was printed but was intended only for private circulation every day until his last illness my father continued his work he would not otherwise have been happy
he demanded from himself less than he had done ten years previously but his daily task was always done i will mention now the titles of his books that were published after the last included in the list which he himself has given at the end of the second volume
an eye for an eye eighteen seventy nine cousin henry eighteen seventy nine thackeray eighteen seventy nine the dukes children eighteen eighty life of cicero
eighteen eighty ayalas angel eighteen eighty one doctor wortles school eighteen eighty one frau frohmann and other stories eighteen eighty two
at the time of his death he had written four fifths of an irish story called the landleaguers shortly about to be published and he left in manuscript a completed novel called an old mans love
which will be published by messrs blackwood and sons in eighteen eighty four in the summer of eighteen eighty my father left london and went to live at harting a village in sussex but on the confines of hampshire
i think he chose that spot because he found there a house that suited him and because of the prettiness of the neighbourhood his last long journey was a trip to italy in the late winter and spring of eighteen eighty one
but he went to ireland twice in eighteen eighty two he went there in may of that year and was then absent nearly a month this journey did him much good for he found that the softer atmosphere relieved his asthma
from which he had been suffering for nearly eighteen months in august following he made another trip to ireland but from this journey he derived less benefit he was much interested in and was very much distressed by the unhappy condition of the country
few men knew ireland better than he did he had lived there for sixteen years and his post office work had taken him into every part of the island in the summer of eighteen eighty two he began his last novel
the landleaguers which as stated above was unfinished when he died this book was a cause of anxiety to him he could not rid his mind of the fact that he had a story already in the course of publication but which he had not yet completed
in no other case except framley parsonage did my father publish even the first number of any novel before he had fully completed the whole tale
he was seized with paralysis on the right side accompanied by loss of speech
nearly five weeks from the night of his attack i have been led to say these few words not at all from a desire to supplement my fathers biography of himself but to mention the main incidents in his life after he had finished his own record
in what i have here said i do not think i have exceeded his instructions
chapter one my education
of so insignificant a person as myself it will not be so much my intention to speak of the little details of my private life as of what i and perhaps others round me have done in literature
of my failures and successes such as they have been and their causes and of the opening which a literary career offers to men and women for the earning of their bread
and yet the garrulity of old age and the aptitude of a mans mind to recur to the passages of his own life will i know tempt me to say something of myself
nor without doing so should i know how to throw my matter into any recognised and intelligible form that i or any man should tell everything of himself i hold to be impossible
i will set down naught in malice nor will i give to myself or others honour which i do not believe to have been fairly won my boyhood was i think as unhappy as that of a young gentleman could well be
my misfortunes arising from a mixture of poverty and gentle standing on the part of my father
i was born in eighteen fifteen in keppel street russell square and while a baby was carried down to harrow where my father had built a house on a large farm
and perhaps the director of her destiny and of ours my father had been a wykamist and a fellow of new college and winchester was the destination of my brothers and myself
and sent three of us there one after the other at the age of seven my father at this time was a chancery barrister practising in london
chambers which on one melancholy occasion did become absolutely suicidal
in his early days he was a man of some small fortune and of higher hopes these stood so high at the time of my birth that he was felt to be entitled to a country house as well as to that in keppel street
this place he called julians and the land runs up to the foot of the hill on which the school and church stand on the side towards london things there went much against him the farm was ruinous
but at any rate as other day boarders i do not suppose that they were well treated but i doubt whether they were subjected to the ignominy which i endured
i was only seven and i think that boys at seven are now spared among their more considerate seniors i was never spared and was not even allowed to run to and fro between our house and the school
without a daily purgatory no doubt my appearance was against me i remember well when i was still the junior boy in the school doctor butler the head master stopping me in the street and asking me
perhaps he did not recognise me by my face at this time i was three years at harrow and as far as i can remember i was the junior boy in the school when i left it
then i was sent to a private school at sunbury kept by arthur drury this i think must have been done in accordance with the advice of henry drury who was my tutor at harrow school and my fathers friend
we were not allowed to visit the playground till the sermon was finished mine was only done a day or two before the holidays missus drury when she saw us shook her head with pitying horror
there were ever so many other punishments accumulated on our heads it broke my heart knowing myself to be innocent and suffering also under the almost equally painful feeling that the other three no doubt wicked boys
might be supposed to be the leader of wickedness on the first day of the next term he whispered to me half a word that perhaps he had been wrong with all a stupid boys slowness i said nothing
and he had not the courage to carry reparation further all that was fifty years ago and it burns me now as though it were yesterday what lily livered curs those boys must have been not to have told the truth
at any rate as far as i was concerned i remember their names well and almost wish to write them here when i was twelve there came the vacancy at winchester college which i was destined to fill
my two elder brothers had gone there and the younger had been taken away being already supposed to have lost his chance of new college it had been one of the great ambitions of my fathers life that his three sons who lived to go to winchester
should all become fellows of new college but that suffering man was never destined to have an ambition gratified we all lost the prize which he struggled with infinite labour to put within our reach
my eldest brother all but achieved it and afterwards went to oxford taking three exhibitions from the school though he lost the great glory of a wykamist he has since made himself well known to the public as a writer
in connection with all italian subjects
but my other brother died early while i was at winchester my fathers affairs went from bad to worse he gave up his practice at the bar and unfortunate that he was took another farm
it is odd that a man should conceive and in this case a highly educated and a very clever man that farming should be a business in which he might make money without any special education or apprenticeship
perhaps of all trades it is the one in which an accurate knowledge of what things should be done and the best manner of doing them is most necessary and it is one also for success in which a sufficient capital is indispensable
he had no knowledge and when he took this second farm no capital this was the last step preparatory to his final ruin
i have no clear knowledge of her object or of my fathers but i believe that he had an idea that money might be made by sending goods little goods such as pin cushions pepper boxes and pocket knives out to the still unfurnished states
i have seen it since in the town of cincinnati a sorry building but i have been told that in those days it was an imposing edifice my mother went first with my sisters and second brother
then my father followed them taking my elder brother before he went to oxford
there have been hot words between us for perfect friendship bears and allows hot words few brothers have had more of brotherhood but in those school days he was of all my foes the worst
in accordance with the practice of the college which submits or did then submit much of the tuition of the younger boys from the elder he was my tutor and in his capacity of teacher and ruler
he had studied the theories of draco
hang a little boy for stealing apples he used to say and other little boys will not steal apples the doctrine was already exploded elsewhere but he stuck to it with conservative energy the result was that as
a part of his daily exercise he thrashed me with a big stick that such thrashings should have been possible at a school as a continual part of ones daily life
seems to me to argue a very ill condition of school discipline at this period i remember to have passed one set of holidays the midsummer holidays in my fathers chambers in lincolns inn
there was often a difficulty about the holidays as to what should be done with me on this occasion my amusement consisted in wandering about among those old deserted buildings and in reading shakespeare out of a bi columned edition
which is still among my books it was not that i had chosen shakespeare but that there was nothing else to read after a while my brother left winchester and accompanied my father to america
then another and a different horror fell to my fate my college bills had not been paid and the school tradesmen who administered to the wants of the boys were told not to extend their credit to me
boots waistcoats and pocket handkerchiefs which with some slight superveillance were at the command of other scholars were closed luxuries to me my schoolfellows of course knew that it was so and i became a pariah
it is the nature of boys to be cruel i have sometimes doubted whether among each other they do usually suffer much one from the others cruelty but i suffered horribly
i could make no stand against it i had no friend to whom i could pour out my sorrows i was big and awkward and ugly and i have no doubt skulked about in a most unattractive manner
of course i was ill dressed and dirty but ah how well i remember all the agonies of my young heart how i considered whether i should always be alone
whether i could not find my way up to the top of that college tower and from thence put an end to everything and a worse thing came than the stoppage of the supplies from the shopkeepers every boy had a shilling a week pocket money which we called battels
and which was advanced to us out of the pocket of the second master on one awful day the second master announced to me that my battels would be stopped he told me the reason
the battels for the last half year had not been repaid and he urged his own unwillingness to advance the money the loss of a shilling a week would not have been much even though pocket money from other sources never reached me
and now when it came to the turn of any servant he received sixty nine shillings instead of seventy and the cause of the defalcation was explained to him
when i had been at winchester something over three years my father returned to england and took me away whether this was done because of the expense or because my chance of new college was supposed to have passed away
my father at this time having left my mother and sisters with my younger brother in america took himself to live at a wretched tumble down farmhouse on the second farm he had hired and i was taken there with him it was nearly three miles from harrow
at harrow weald but in the parish and from this house i was again sent to that school as a day boarder let those who know what is the usual appearance and what the usual appurtenances of a boy at such a school
from barns to cowsheds and from cowsheds to dung heaps one could hardly tell where one began and the other ended there was a parlour in which my father lived shut up among big books
but i passed my most jocund hours in the kitchen making innocent love to the bailiffs daughter the farm kitchen might be very well through the evening when the horrors of the school were over but it all added to the cruelty of the days
a sizar at a cambridge college or a bible clerk at oxford has not pleasant days or used not to have them half a century ago but his position was recognised and the misery was measured
the indignities i endured are not to be described as i look back it seems to me that all hands were turned against me those of masters as well as boys i was allowed to join in no plays
the only expense except that of books to which a house boarder was then subject was the fee to a tutor amounting i think to ten guineas my tutor took me without the fee
but when i heard him declare the fact in the pupil room before the boys i hardly felt grateful for the charity i was never a coward and cared for a thrashing as little as any boy
but one cannot make a stand against the acerbities of three hundred tyrants without a moral courage of which at that time i possessed none i know that i skulked and was odious to the eyes of those i admired and envied
at last i was driven to rebellion and there came a great fight at the end of which my opponent had to be taken home for a while if these words be ever printed
i trust that some schoolfellow of those days may still be left alive who will be able to say that in claiming this solitary glory of my school days i am not making a false boast
i wish i could give some adequate picture of the gloom of that farmhouse my elder brother tom as i must call him in my narrative though the world i think knows him best as adolphus was at oxford
my father and i lived together he having no means of living except what came from the farm my memory tells me that he was always in debt to his landlord and to the tradesmen he employed
of self indulgence no one could accuse him our table was poorer i think than that of the bailiff who still hung on to our shattered fortunes the furniture was mean and scanty
into the hay field on holidays i was often compelled to go not i fear with much profit my fathers health was very bad during the last ten years of his life he spent nearly the half of his time in bed
it was his ambition to describe all ecclesiastical terms including the denominations of every fraternity of monks and every convent of nuns with all their orders and subdivisions
under crushing disadvantages with few or no books of reference with immediate access to no library he worked at his most ungrateful task with unflagging industry when he died
three numbers out of eight had been published by subscription and are now i fear unknown and buried in the midst of that huge pile of futile literature the building up of which has broken so many hearts
and my father though he would try
and say my early rules from the latin grammar or repeat the greek alphabet and was obliged at these early lessons to hold my head inclined towards him
so that in the event of guilty fault he might be able to pull my hair without stopping his razor or dropping his shaving brush no father was ever more anxious for the education of his children
though i think none ever knew less how to go about the work of amusement as far as i can remember he never recognised the need
he could not give his time to teach me for every hour that he was not in the fields was devoted to his monks and nuns but he would require me to sit at a table with lexicon and gradus before me
though i think i grieved him much by my idleness but in passion he knew not what he did and he has knocked me down with the great folio bible which he always used
in the old house were the two first volumes of coopers novel called the prairie a relic probably a dishonest relic of some subscription to hookhams library other books of the kind there was none
i wonder how many dozen times i read those two first volumes
it was the horror of those dreadful walks backwards and forwards which made my life so bad what so pleasant what so sweet as a walk along an english lane when the air is sweet and the weather fine
and when there is a charm in walking but here were the same lanes four times a day in wet and dry in heat and summer with all the accompanying mud and dust and with disordered clothes
but his successor lived to be archbishop of canterbury i think it was in the autumn of eighteen thirty one that my mother with the rest of the family returned from america
she lived at first at the farmhouse but it was only for a short time she came back with a book written about the united states and the immediate pecuniary success which that work obtained enabled her to take us all back to the house at harrow
not to the first house which would still have been beyond her means but to that which has since been called orley farm and which was an eden as compared to our abode at harrow weald
here my schooling went on under somewhat improved circumstances the three miles became half a mile and probably some salutary changes were made in my wardrobe
and a great element of happiness was added to us all in the affectionate and life enduring friendship of the family of our close neighbour colonel grant but i was never able to overcome or even to attempt to overcome the absolute isolation of my school position
i have felt that i had no right to talk of things from most of which i was kept in estrangement through all my fathers troubles he still desired to send me either to oxford or cambridge
and very fortunate it was that i did not succeed for my career with such assistance only as a scholarship would have given me would have ended in debt and ignominy when i left harrow i was all but nineteen
and i had at first gone there at seven during the whole of those twelve years no attempt had been made to teach me anything but latin and greek and very little attempt to teach me those languages
at the school at sunbury there was certainly a writing master and a french master the latter was an extra and i never had extras
i suppose i must have been in the writing masters class but though i can call to mind the man i cannot call to mind his ferule it was by their ferules that i always knew them and they me
i feel convinced in my mind that i have been flogged oftener than any human being alive it was just possible to obtain five scourgings in one day at winchester
and i have often boasted that i obtained them all looking back over half a century
i am now a fair latin scholar that is to say i read and enjoy the latin classics and could probably make myself understood in latin prose but the knowledge which i have i have acquired since i left school
i bear in mind well with how prodigal a hand prizes used to be showered about but i never got a prize from the first to the last there was nothing satisfactory in my school career
sonya and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only natasha and the countess remained in the room petya was no longer with the family
which was making for troitsa the countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natasha pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving
and paid no attention to her fathers words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant three houses off oh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn
theres an awful glow natasha do look you can see it from the window she said to her cousin evidently wishing to distract her mind but natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been in this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the surprise and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason
found it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrews wound and of his being with their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with sonya
paid unceasing attention to her cousin look natasha how dreadfully it is burning said she whats burning asked natasha oh yes moscow
and as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she turned her face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything and again settled down in her former attitude
but you didnt see it yes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace
nor anything else could seem of importance to natasha the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when natasha was ill
then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her you are cold
lie down all right i will ill lie down at once said natasha
where was he going how was he wounded was it serious and could she see him but after she had been told that she could not see him that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all
evidently disbelieving what they told her and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes
and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she was planning something and either
deciding or had already decided something in her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did not know and this alarmed and tormented her natasha undress darling lie down on my bed
a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha replied irritably
and she went to the window and opened it through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame
natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob
the countess exchanged a look with sonya lie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softly touching natashas shoulders come lie down oh yes
ill lie down at once said natasha and began hurriedly undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket
that had been made up on the floor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and began replaiting it
her long thin practiced fingers rapidly unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side to side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide
when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door natasha youd better lie in the middle said sonya ill stay here muttered natasha
do lie down she added crossly and buried her face in the pillow the countess madame schoss and sonya undressed hastily and lay down the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room
but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little mytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern mamonovs cossacks had set up across the street and the adjutants unceasing moans
could still be heard for a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her
and sonyas gentle breathing then the countess called to natasha natasha did not answer i think shes asleep mamma said sonya softly
after a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied soon after that natasha heard her mothers even breathing natasha did not move though her little bare foot
thrust out from under the quilt was growing cold on the bare floor as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near by
the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the adjutant was heard natasha sat up sonya are you asleep mamma she whispered
no one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple bare feet the boards of the floor creaked
stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room
it was her own heart sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her
with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed
on which something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering wick from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews wound and his presence there natasha had resolved to see him
she did not know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful
all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see how was he maimed what was left of him
was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether like that in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees
raised under the quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she cautiously took one step and then another
and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another man timokhin was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor
the valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg gazed with wide open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white
dressing jacket and nightcap the valets sleepy frightened exclamation
horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt
and such as she had always seen him he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck delicate as a childs
revealed by the turn down collar of his shirt gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on her knees
seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels which were injured
were in the doctors opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the first night after they left moscow
had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness
when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor
he felt prince andrews pulse and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a little later with greater suffering
timokhin the red nosed major of prince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodino they were accompanied by a doctor
prince andrews valet his coachman and two orderlies they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something
i dont want any more is timokhin here he asked timokhin crept along the bench to him i am here your excellency hows your wound mine sir
prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something couldnt one get a book he asked what book the gospels i havent one
the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably
and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh
that came from the wound began examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony
he kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him what trouble would it be to you he said
he pleaded in a piteous voice the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands
that i wonder how he can bear it by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said the valet the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how
was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him
and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness and those
thoughts though now vague and indefinite again possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them
the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage
someone was shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom
his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention
a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts
all the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth
it had never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again yes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived
he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on man
every man can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off
and prince andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating piti piti piti and then
and ti ti once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters
to the sound of this whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of
whispered rhythmic music it stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles
he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face
each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising
which also oppressed him but perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats my legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out and
piti piti piti and ti ti and piti piti piti thats enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force
for some purpose or for some reason but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object
now again i feel that bliss to love ones neighbors
but an enemy can only be loved by divine love
is he alive when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it it is the very essence of the soul
yet how many people have i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did her
not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings her sufferings shame and remorse
if only it were possible for me to see her once more just once looking into those eyes to say piti piti piti and
ti ti and piti piti piti boom flopped the fly and his attention was suddenly carried into another world
and delirium in which something particular was happening in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was still burning
but besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just been thinking
oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer
but he could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out and the strange face was before him
he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears
when he came to himself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him
he realized that it was the real living natasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionless on her knees she was unable to stir
with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it something quivered prince andrew sighed with relief smiled
and held out his hand you he said how fortunate with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on her knees and taking his hand carefully
just touching it lightly with her lips forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him forgive me i love you said prince andrew
forgive what he asked
broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just touching it with her lips i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her face with his hand
so as to look into her eyes those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous love natashas thin pale face with its swollen lips
was more than plain it was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard the sound of voices behind them peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor
timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench whats this said the doctor rising from his bed
please go away madam at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her daughters absence knocked at the door like a somnambulist
fell sobbing on her bed from that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at every halting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never left the wounded bolkonski
and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die in her daughters arms during the journey
as judging by what the doctor said it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose natasha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed
no one least of all natasha and prince andrew spoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia
was not the only village to be seen from blue mountain there was another which farmer green seldom visited because it lay beyond the mountain and was a long distance from his house though he owned the land where it stood
those that lived there thought they had every right to stay there as long as they pleased without being disturbed it was in this village that brownie beaver and his neighbors lived it was a different sort of town too
from the one where farmer green went each week over beyond blue mountain all the houses were built in a pond and all their doors were under water but nobody minded that because like brownie beaver
everybody that dwelt there was a fine swimmer years and years before brownies time his forefathers had come there and finding that there were many trees in the neighborhood with the sort of bark they liked to eat
such as poplars willows and box elders they had decided that it was a good place to live there was a small stream too which was really the beginning of swift river
and by damming it those old settlers made a pond in which they could build their houses they had ideas of their own as to what a house should be like
though you perhaps might not care for them at all they wanted their houses to be surrounded by water because they thought they were safer when built in that manner and they always insisted that a door leading into a house
should be far beneath the surface of the water for they believed that that made a house safer too to you such an idea may seem very strange but if you were chased by an enemy you might be glad to be able to swim under water
down to the bottom of a pond and slip inside a door which led to a winding hall
of course your enemy might be able to swim as well as you but maybe he would think twice or even three times before he went prowling through your crooked hall for if you had enormous strong sharp teeth
with which you could gnaw right through a tree he would not care to have you seize him as he poked his head around a corner in a dark passage of a strange house it was in a house of that kind that brownie beaver lived
and he built it himself because he said he would rather have a neat new house than one of the big old dwellings that had been built many years before when his great great grandfather had helped throw the dam across the stream the dam was there still
it was so old that trees were growing on it and there was an odd thing about it it was never finished though brownie beaver was a young chap he worked on the dam sometimes like all his neighbors
you see the villagers kept making the dam wider and since it was built of sticks and mud the water sometimes washed bits of it away so it had to be kept in repair if brownie beaver and his friends had neglected their dam
and without any water to hide their doorways they would have been safe no longer they would have had no place either to store their winters food for they were in the habit of cutting down trees and saving the bark and branches too
in order to have plenty to eat when cold weather came and the ice closed their pond some of their food they carried into their houses through a straight hall which was made for that very purpose
and some of the branches they fastened under water near the dam it was just like putting green things into a refrigerator so they will keep now you see why brownie beaver would no more have thought of building his house on dry land
than you would think of building one in a pond everybody likes his own way best and it never once occurred to brownie beaver that his way was the least bit strange
after mister crow flew back to pleasant valley to gather news for him brownie beaver carefully counted each day that passed since mister crow had agreed to be his newspaper and come each saturday afternoon to tell him everything that had happened during the week
brownie was in a great hurry for saturday to arrive in order to make no mistake he put aside a stick in which he gnawed a notch each day and in that way he knew exactly when saturday came
that was probably the longest day in brownie beavers life at least it seemed so to him whenever he saw a bird soaring above the tree tops he couldnt help hoping it was mister crow
brownie beaver dropped whatever he happened to be doing expecting that mister crow would flap into sight at any moment brownie had many disappointments but mister crow really came at last
he lighted right on top of brownie beavers house and called paper down the chimney just like that brownie happened to be inside his house and in a wonderfully short time his head appeared
above the water and he soon crawled up beside mister crow well i am glad to see you he told mister crow peter mink caught a monstrous eel in the duck pond on monday mister crow said
being a newspaper he thought he ought to say nothing except what was news not even good afternoon mister rabbit of pine ridge with his wife and fourteen children is visiting his brother mister jeremiah rabbit
mister crow continued to relate in a singsong voice goodness gracious brownie beaver exclaimed fatty coon mister crow said fatty coon was confined to his house by illness tuesday night
he ate too many dried apples well well brownie beaver murmured and he started to ask mister crow a question but mister crow interrupted him with more news
missus bear had a birthday on wednesday an enjoyable time was had by all except the pig pig brownie beaver asked what pig the pig they ate said mister crow
and he went right on talking on thursday mister woodchuck went to visit his cousins in the west missus woodchuck is worried whats she worried about brownie inquired shes afraid hes coming back again
mister crow explained i have heard he was lazy brownie said what happened on friday tommy fox made a visit but he didnt have a good time at all mister crow reported
and he left faster than he came brownie beaver wanted to know where tommy fox made his visit at farmer greens hen house mister crow explained why did he hurry away brownie asked
old dog spot chased him mister crow replied but you mustnt ask questions he complained you cant ask questions of a newspaper you know well what happened on saturday
another question i declare i dont believe you ever took a newspaper before did you brownie beaver admitted that he never had then said mister crow then dont interrupt me again please
ill tell you all the news ive brought and when ive finished ill stop being a newspaper and be myself for a while and then we can talk but not before he insisted brownie beaver nodded his head
he was afraid that if he said another word mister crow would grow angry and fly away without telling him any more news
jimmy rabbit almost cut off frisky squirrels tail mister crow paused and looked at brownie beaver out of the corner of his eye he knew that brownie would want to know what prevented the accident but he was in no hurry to tell him
for a few moments brownie waited to hear the rest but a few moments was more than he could endure why didnt jimmy cut off his tail brownie asked eagerly there said mister crow youve done just as i told you not to
so i shall not tell you the rest until next saturday you see you have a few things to learn about taking a newspaper
there was great rejoicing in the little village in the pond when brownie beaver returned with the good news that there would be no more hunting and fishing and when old grandaddy beaver said that everybody ought to take a holiday to celebrate the occasion
all the villagers said it was a fine idea so they stopped working for once and began to plan the celebration they thought that there ought to be swimming races and tree felling contests
and brownie beaver said that after the holiday was over he would suggest that someone be chosen to go down and thank farmer green for putting the notice on the tree the whole village agreed to brownies proposal
brownie beaver himself passed his hat around to take up the votes and it was quickly found that every vote was for brownie beaver he had even voted for himself but no one seemed to care about that
and another in which each person who took part had to stay beneath the surface as long as he could that last race caused some trouble a young scamp called slippery sam won it and many people thought that he had swum up inside his house
where he could get air without being seen but no one could prove it so he won the race just the same next came the tree felling contest there were six including brownie beaver that took part in it
grandaddy beaver had picked out six trees of exactly the same size each person in the contest had to try to bring his tree to the ground first and that caused some trouble too because some claimed that their trees were of harder wood than others
and more difficult to gnaw while others complained that the bark of their trees tasted very bitter and of course that made their task unpleasant those six trees falling one after another made such a racket
that old mister crow heard the noise miles away and flew over to see what was happening after everybody crept out of his hiding place some time afterward everyone had to hide for a while you know
there was mister crow sitting upon one of the fallen trees
then they told him about the celebration and mister crow began to laugh what are you going to do next he asked were a going to send brownie beaver over to pleasant valley
to thank farmer green for his kindness in putting an end to hunting and fishing said old grandaddy beaver and hes a going to start right away mister crow looked around and there was brownie beaver
with a lunch basket in his hand all ready to begin his long journey say good by to him then said mister crow for youll never see him again what do you mean grandaddy beaver asked
and as for brownie he was so frightened that he dropped his basket right in the water i mean said mister crow
you dont seem to have understood that sign in the first place it was not farmer green but his son johnnie who nailed it to the tree
that is why one of the words was misspelled no doubt mister crow remarked as a matter of fact not being able to read he hadnt known about the word that was spelled wrong in the second place he continued
the sign doesnt mean that hunting and fishing are to be stopped it means that no one but johnnie green is going to hunt and fish in this neighborhood
and instead of hunting and fishing being stopped
he added that johnnie green had a new gun on this birthday brownie beaver said at once that he was not going on the errand of thanks i resign he said and anyone that wants to go in my place is welcome to do so
but nobody cared to go and the whole village seemed greatly disappointed until grandaddy beaver made a short speech
chapter two going to the south my country shall thy honoured name be as a bye word through the world rouse for as if to blast thy fame this keen reproach is at thee hurled
the banner that above the waves is floating oer three million slaves dick walker the slave speculator who had purchased currer and althesa put them in prison until his gang was made up
and then with his forty slaves started for the new orleans market as many of the slaves had been brought up in richmond and had relations residing there the slave trader determined to leave the city early in the morning
so as not to witness any of those scenes so common where slaves are separated from their relatives and friends when about departing for the southern market this plan was successful for not even clotel who had been every day at the prison to see her mother and sister
knew of their departure a march of eight days through the interior of the state and they arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they were all put on board a steamer and then speedily sailed for the place of their destination
walker had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there at a stated time with a prime lot of able bodied slaves ready for field service together with a few extra ones between the ages of fifteen and twenty five
but like most who make a business of buying and selling slaves for gain he often bought some who were far advanced in years and would always try to sell them for five or ten years younger than they actually were
few persons can arrive at anything like the age of a negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race therefore the slave trader very frequently carried out this deception with perfect impunity after the steamer had left the wharf
and instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market amongst the forty negroes were several whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through some services
their grey hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the traders advertisement
and if he did not take delight in discharging his duty he did it with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of his master pomp as walker usually called him was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself
dis nigger is no countefit he is de genewine artekil
had a set of teeth which for whiteness and beauty could not be surpassed his eyes large lips thick and hair short and woolly
that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the heartrending scenes which daily occurred in his presence it was on the second day of the steamers voyage that pompey selected five of the old slaves took them in a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market
well said pompey addressing himself to the company i is de gentman dat is to get you ready so dat you will bring marser a good price in de orleans market how old is you
addressing himself to a man who from appearance was not less than forty if i live to see next corn planting time i will either be forty five or fifty five i dont know which
but now you is only thirty years old dat is what marser says you is to be i know i is more den dat responded the man i knows nothing about dat
but when you get in de market an anybody axe you how old you is an you tell em forty five marser will tie you up an gib you de whip like smoke
well den i guess i will only be thirty when dey axe me replied the chattel
answered the man oh uncle jim is it yes den you must have off dem dare whiskers of yours an when you get to orleans you must grease dat face an make it look shiney
i was twenty nine last potato digging time said the man whats your name my name is tobias but dey call me toby well toby or mister tobias if dat will suit you better
you is now twenty three years old an no more dus you hear dat yes responded toby
and then reported to his master that the old boys were all right at eight oclock on the evening of the third day the lights of another steamer were seen in the distance and apparently coming up very fast this was a signal for a general commotion on the patriot
and everything indicated that a steamboat race was at hand nothing can exceed the excitement attendant upon a steamboat race on the mississippi river by the time the boats had reached memphis they were side by side
and each exerting itself to keep the ascendancy in point of speed the night was clear the moon shining brightly and the boats so near to each other that the passengers were calling out from one boat to the other
on board the patriot the firemen were using oil lard butter and even bacon with the wood for the purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch the blaze mingled with the black smoke showed plainly that the other boat was burning more than wood
the two boats soon locked so that the hands of the boats were passing from vessel to vessel and the wildest excitement prevailed throughout amongst both passengers and crew
at this moment the engineer of the patriot was seen to fasten down the safety valve so that no steam should escape this was indeed a dangerous resort
the patriot stopped to take in passengers and still no steam was permitted to escape
and as might have been expected one of the boilers immediately exploded one dense fog of steam filled every part of the vessel while shrieks groans and cries were heard on every hand the saloons and cabins soon had the appearance of a hospital
by this time the boat had landed and the columbia the other boat
the killed and scalded nineteen in number
thousands of dollars change hands during a passage from louisville or saint louis to new orleans on a mississippi steamer and many men and even ladies are completely ruined go call my boy steward
said mister smith as he took his cards one by one from the table in a few moments a fine looking bright eyed mulatto boy apparently about fifteen years of age was standing by his masters side at the table
i will see you and five hundred dollars better said smith as his servant jerry approached the table
he will bring a thousand dollars any day in the new orleans market replied smith then you bet the whole of the boy do you yes i call you then said johnson at the same time spreading his cards out upon the table
you have beat me said smith as soon as he saw the cards jerry who was standing on top of the table with the bank notes and silver dollars round his feet was now ordered to descend from the table
you will not forget that you belong to me said johnson as the young slave was stepping from the table to a chair no sir replied the chattel
yes sir responded jerry as he wiped the tears from his eyes smith took from his pocket the bill of sale and handed it to johnson at the same time saying
i claim the right of redeeming that boy mister johnson my father gave him to me when i came of age and i promised not to part with him most certainly sir the boy shall be yours whenever you hand me over a cool thousand replied johnson
the next morning as the passengers were assembling in the breakfast saloons and upon the guards of the vessel and the servants were seen running about waiting upon or looking for their masters poor jerry was entering his new masters stateroom with his boots
who do you belong to said a gentleman to an old black man
when i went to sleep last night i belonged to governor lucas but i understand dat he is bin gambling all night so i dont know who owns me dis morning such is the uncertainty of a slaves position
he goes to bed at night the property of the man with whom he has lived for years and gets up in the morning the slave of some one whom he has never seen before
to behold five or six tables in a steamboats cabin with half a dozen men playing at cards and money pistols bowie knives all in confusion on the tables is what may be seen at almost any time on the mississippi river on the fourth day while at natchez
taking in freight and passengers walker who had been on shore to see some of his old customers returned accompanied by a tall thin faced man dressed in black with a white neckcloth which immediately proclaimed him to be a clergyman
i want a good trusty woman for house service said the stranger as they entered the cabin where walkers slaves were kept here she is and no mistake replied the trader stand up currer my gal heres a gentleman who wishes to see if you will suit him
she is a rare cook a good washer and will suit you to a t i am sure if you buy me i hope you will buy my daughter too said the woman in rather an excited manner
i only want one for my own use and would not need another said the man in black as he and the trader left the room walker and the parson went into the saloon talked over the matter the bill of sale was made out the money paid over
and the clergyman left with the understanding that the woman should be delivered to him at his house it seemed as if poor althesa would have wept herself to death for the first two days after her mother had been torn from her side by the hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh
on the arrival of the boat at baton rouge an additional number of passengers were taken on board and amongst them several persons who had been attending the races gambling and drinking were now the order of the day
which caused great uneasiness to the ladies and took the gentlemen to that part of the cabin however nothing serious had occurred a man at one of the tables where they were gambling had been seen attempting to conceal a card in his sleeve
and one of the party seized his pistol and fired but fortunately the barrel of the pistol was knocked up just as it was about to be discharged and the ball passed through the upper deck instead of the mans head as intended order was soon restored
all went on well the remainder of the night and the next day at ten oclock the boat arrived at new orleans
our eyes are yet on africs shores her thousand wrongs we still deplore we see the grim slave trader there we hear his fettered victims prayer and hasten to the sufferers aid
forgetful of our own slave trade the ocean pirates fiend like form shall sink beneath the vengeance storm his heart of steel shall quake before the battle din and havoc roar
the knave shall die the law hath said while it protects our own slave trade what earthly eye presumes to scan the wily proteus heart of man what potent hand will eer unroll
the mantled treachery of his soul o where is he who hath surveyed the horrors of our own slave trade there is an eye that wakes in light there is a hand of peerless might which soon or late
shall yet assail and rend dissimulations veil
he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village ill show them ill give it to them the brigands said he to himself
what decision have you been pleased to come to said he rostov stopped
decision what decision
and you cant manage them youre a traitor yourself i know you ill flay you all alive and as if afraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidly forward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace with rostov at a gliding gait
and continued to impart his views he said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it not be better first to send for the military ill give them armed force
without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick resolute steps toward the crowd
the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rostovs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked their ex elder how many years have you been fattening on the commune
what does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not weve been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain and thats all about it cried another it was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear
you begrudged your lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dron
karp thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the front dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together
shouted rostov coming up to the crowd with quick steps the elder
but before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side caps off traitors shouted rostov in a wrathful voice wheres the elder he cried furiously the elder he wants the elder
meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling
we dont riot were following the orders declared karp and at that moment several voices began speaking together its as the old men have decided theres too many of you giving orders arguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostov
unmeaningly in a voice not his own gripping karp by the collar bind him bind him he shouted
lavrushka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind shall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called out
by name to come and bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts wheres the elder demanded rostov in a loud voice with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd are you the elder bind him lavrushka
shouted rostov as if that order too could not possibly meet with any opposition and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his own belt and handed it to them as if to aid them and you all listen to me said rostov to the peasants
be off to your houses at once and dont let one of your voices be heard why weve not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness its all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heard bickering with one another
all our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village the two bound men were led off to the masters house the two drunken peasants followed them aye when i look at you said one of them to karp
two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the bogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietors goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at princess marys wish from the cupboard where he had been confined
was standing in the yard directing the men dont put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants
you know it has cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where itll get rubbed i dont like that way of doing things let it all be done properly according to rule
look here put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay thats the way
dont catch up against it its heavy lads solid books yes they worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall round faced peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top
unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostov did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops
at the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess marys expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had occurred
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject
good bye princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you dont want to make me blush please dont thank me but the princess if she did not again thank him in words
thanked him with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french
honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did not leave her memory when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears
more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow well supposing i do love him thought princess mary ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who
would perhaps never love her she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life
sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his words happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments that dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very moment thought princess mary
and that caused his sister to refuse my brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence the impression the princess made on rostov was a very agreeable one to remember her gave him pleasure
rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary who was attractive to him
and had an enormous fortune had against his will more than once entered his head for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy would be able to put his fathers affairs in order
when pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchins broadsheets that had been brought that day
on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmens wives were leaving the city there will be less panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet
that the french would enter moscow the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma that count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at the arsenal
with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near shall i join the army and enter the service
if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the cards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes out it means what does it mean he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess
at the door asking whether she might come in then it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himself come in come in he added to the princess only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waist was still living in pierres house
everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is it that we are staying on on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor
satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit and the people too are quite mutinous
they no longer obey even my maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon begin beating us one cant walk in the streets but above all the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just one thing of you cousin she went on
arrange for me to be taken to petersburg whatever i may be i cant live under bonapartes rule oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the contrary
i wont submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you dont want to do this but i will ill give the order at once the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with muttering to herself she sat down on a chair
but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger see ive just been reading he showed her the broadsheet
oh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is a hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didnt he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly
and honor and glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajolery has brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in french oh but its so you
take everything so to heart said pierre and began laying out his cards for patience although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation
irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible next day toward evening the princess set off and pierres head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment
could not be found without selling one of the estates in general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able to repress a smile
well then sell it said he whats to be done i cant draw back now the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching
hardly anyone he knew was left in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained but he did not go to see them to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of
vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperors desire
get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutuzov to let him know i have informed him of the matter please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time
that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemys hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief on his way home from vorontsovo
stopped and got out of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged the flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a green jacket
who was moaning piteously another criminal thin and pale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchmans face pierre pushed his way in through the crowd
what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking but the attention of the crowd officials burghers shopkeepers peasants and women in cloaks and in pelisses
that no one answered him the stout man rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry
russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the frenchman began to cry the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated
some people began to laugh others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his seat
as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him what is your pleasure where are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to lubyanka street
at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either
he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafey his head coachman who knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscow
and that his saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on
this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk
every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had it was full of officers
everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon were everywhere
pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before
the comforts of life wealth even life itself is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything
why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be
that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscow which we feared more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army which they feared more than anything in the world
what the result must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon
that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle
and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men
he will be three times as strong as i am before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously
we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon
as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleons historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to stop
to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred
the historians provided cunningly devised evidence
of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story
and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding battle of shevardino were fought
there also exists a definite and well known but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement
at the very place where the battle was fought in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the twenty fourth we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it
and on the twenty sixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position on the field of borodino so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself
the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position
he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons
the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the russian empire
by sticking a pin into the map at hazard not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad
that is the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty fifth of august eighteen twelve did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth
and that those begun on the twenty fifth and twenty sixth were not completed and secondly by the position of the shevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted
strongly fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty fourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly
that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced post whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank and that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected where
which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle so that the left flank was at shevardino
and the center at borodino at the confluence of the rivers kolocha and voyna to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought this position
protected by the river kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow napoleon
on the twenty fourth did not see as the history books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa to borodino he could not have seen that position because it did not exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army
but while pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the russian position at the shevardino redoubt and unexpectedly for the russians moved his army across the kolocha
and the russians not having time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified
by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa
semenovsk and borodino a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russia and there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of august took place
had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty fourth to the kolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning
would have taken place where we expected it in that case we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubt our left flank still more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right
and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty fifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard that is immediately after the fight
at gridneva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth the first and chief action of the battle of borodino
was already lost on the twenty fourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty sixth after the loss of the shevardino redoubt
not only was the russian army on the twenty sixth defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the russian commanders
namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left
and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left flank with but half as many men
poniatowskis action against utitsa and uvarovs on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as
in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian army and people it has been described
mister collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for missus bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door
than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself
mister collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied
since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled missus bennet
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it
she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mister collins
but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
sir you quite misunderstand me said missus bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived
her mister bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he
your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so missus bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mister collins and i will never see you again if you do
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly
of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did missus bennet give up the point
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did
mister collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper
i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where missus bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion
she added in a melancholy tone
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children
who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking
but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion
would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mister collins
and on perceiving whom she said to the girls
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte
detained first by the civility of mister collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued
in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned
had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation
without having paid yourself and mister bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself
and if my manner has been at all reprehensible
chapter twenty one the discussion of mister collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it
and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas
mister collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mister wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town
and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed i found said he as the time drew near
that i had better not meet mister darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself
and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it
and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation
but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness
to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mister bingley will not be detained in london by them
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday
he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again
as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter
why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me
i will have no reserves from you
and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself
is heightened into something still more interesting
he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think
when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane
in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many
said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference
and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can
for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy
she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to believe me
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mister darcy for herself
but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second
in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine
that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone
is that she is deceiving herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means
even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth
and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes
however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject
and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield
and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that missus bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length
and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mister collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful
and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of
by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design
for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there
in as short a time as mister collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas
who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mister bennet was likely to live
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mister collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at saint jamess
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it
her reflections were in general satisfactory mister collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary
but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object
and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven
without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet
whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mister collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family
for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial
for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night
and missus bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mister bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return
immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir
you cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable
stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary
not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers
related the event of the day before the possibility of mister collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him
seemed almost as far from possibility
and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mister collins
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected
she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza
and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mister collins was wishing to marry you
i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mister collinss character
i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause
the strangeness of mister collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own
that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mister collins was a most humiliating picture
chapter ten measure ninety seven from the standpoint of the eye a measure is that portion of the staff found between two bars in certain cases this space may be less than a measure
as e g at the beginning and end of a movement but from the standpoint of the ear a single isolated measure is not possible and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form
measures are similarly accented groups of evenly spaced beats each group having at least one accented and one non accented beat the strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure
two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical measure one a group of even beats or pulses always felt though not always actually sounded
one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest two certain rhythmic figures
cetera which form the actual musical content of these groups the student will note the essential difference between rhythm and measure rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a series of beats or pulses
while measure is the grouping of these beats according to some specified system in listening to a piece of music two hearers a and b may feel the rhythm equally strongly
but a may subjectively group the beats into one two one two et cetera while b feels the groups as one two three four one two three four et cetera
rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing inherent in the music itself while measure is to a certain extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have adopted for practical purposes ninety eight
in syncopation the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents
and compound a simple measure is one which has but a single accent
two beat measure and three beat measure a compound measure is as its name implies one made up by combining two or more simple measures or by the elaboration of a single measure in slow tempo
into several constituent groups the principal compound measures are four beat and six beat both being referred to as compound duple measures five beat seven beat nine beat and twelve beat measures
are also classified as compound measures an english writer
classifies measures as duple triple or quadruple specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves
and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted note whose value can be divided into three parts
there is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection the principal question at issue being whether four beat measure is an individual variety
or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempi
perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true
in which there are three beats the first one being accented the second and third unaccented
three eighth three quarter and three half measure respectively three quadruple in which there are four beats the first and third being accented primary accent on one secondary accent on three
the second and fourth unaccented
four sextuple in which there are six beats the first and fourth being accented the others not in rapid tempi this is always taken as compound duple measure a dotted quarter note having a beat
it will be noted that the two measures
but these are practically always taken as three beat and four beat measures respectively being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet
quintuple five beat and septuple seven beat measures are occasionally met with but these are rare and will always be sporadic the five beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two
or of two and three sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition while the seven beat measure is taken in groups of four and three or of three and four
but usage varies somewhat and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four half measure
but an incomplete circle differentiating two beat imperfect measure from three beat perfect measure
chapter seven going to nome one beautiful day in the spring of nineteen hundred i sailed again for alaska this time for nome from san francisco
an english family consisting of the mother one son and a daughter were to accompany me and we had spent weeks in making our preparations we were taking supplies of clothing food
tents and bedding sufficient to last until some of our numerous plans of work after our arrival brought in returns my hope was to meet my father there for he had written that he thought he should go to the new gold fields
where he could do beach mining i was not above doing any honest work and felt confident that i could make my way if i could gain an entrance into that country the english people were all workers and i had known them for ten years or more
our steamer was the good ship saint paul belonging to the alaska commercial company and was advertised to sail on may twenty fifth
when i laughingly called the attention of one of the owners of the ship to the fact that that date fell upon friday and many persons objected to sailing upon that day he postponed the starting of the saint paul to may twenty sixth
and we left the dock on saturday afternoon amid the cheers and hand waving of thousands of people who had come to see the big boat off for nome the steamer was well fitted out spick and span in fresh carpets and paint
and crowded to the utmost capacity for comfort every stateroom was full each seat at the tables occupied not a foot of space above or below decks was left unused but provision was made for all
and the ship was well manned i was now much gratified to learn that there were many on board whom i had met before that the steward stewardess and several of the waiters had been on duty on the steamer bertha
during my trip out from alaska the fall before while i was upon speaking terms with a dozen or more of the passengers with whom i had traveled from the same place of passengers we had all told
four hundred and eighty seven of these thirty five were women there was only one child on board and that was the little black eyed girl with her eskimo mother and white father from golovin bay
whom i had seen at saint michael some months before and who was now going back to her northern home she wore a sailor suit of navy blue serge trimmed with white braid and was as coy and cunning as ever
not speaking often to strangers but laughing and running away to her mother when addressed from the day we sailed from san francisco until we reached nome i missed no meals in the dining salon
a pace which my english friends and others could not follow for they were uncomfortably ill in the region of their digestive apparatus for several days i slept for hours each day and thoroughly enjoyed the trip
during the nine days sail from san francisco to unalaska a distance of two thousand three hundred and sixty eight miles i studied well the passengers we had preachers on board
as well as doctors lawyers merchants and miners and there were women going to nome to start eating houses hotels and mercantile shops there were several swedish missionaries
one a zealous young woman from san francisco going to the swedish mission at golovin bay this young person was pretty and pleasant and i was glad to make her acquaintance as well as that of three other women speaking the same tongue
and occupying the next stateroom to mine the last named were going to start a restaurant in nome as they were sociable jolly and good sailors for the most part i enjoyed their society they had all lived in san francisco for years
and though not related to each other were firm friends of long standing and were uniting their little fortunes in the hope of making greater ones the young missionary was a friend to the other three
and i found no better or more congenial companions on board the ship than these four honest hard working women so full of hope courage and good sense as well as christianity
little did i then think that these people placed by a seeming chance in an adjoining stateroom were to be my fellow workers and true friends not only for the coming months in that arctic land to which we were going but
as the sequel will show perhaps for years to come not many days had passed when we found that we had on board what few steamers can boast of and that was an orchestra of professional musicians among the waiters
these were men going with all the others to seek their fortunes in the new gold fields working their passage as waiters on the ship to nome where they intended to leave it three evenings in the week these musicians
with the help of several singers on board gave concerts in the dining salon which though impromptu were very enjoyable a sweet and trained singer was the english girl of our company
and she sang many times accompanied by the stringed instruments of the musicians much to the delight of the assembled passengers when she sang one evening in her clear sympathetic voice the selection
oh where is my wandering boy tonight there was not a dry eye in the room and the mind of many a man went back to his old home and praying mother in some far distant state
making him resolve to write oftener to her that she might be comforted with a knowledge of his whereabouts and welfare these evenings were sometimes varied by recitations from an elocutionist on board
and a practised clog dancer excited the risibles of the company to the extent that they usually shouted with laughter at his exhibition of flying heels day after day passed
those who were continually seasick had diversion enough it was useless for us to tell them a pathetic tale of some one who at some time had been more ill than they because they would not believe a word of it
and it was equally useless to recommend an antidote for mal de mer such as theirs no one was ever so ill before they said they knew they should die and be buried at sea
and hoped they would if that would put an end to their sufferings we tried at last to give them comfort by recommending out of former experiences ships biscuit dry toast and pop corn as remedies
but only received black looks as our reward we then concluded that a diet of tea coffee and soup was exactly such a one as the fishes would recommend could they speak
these favorite and much used liquids keeping up a continual swishing in ones interior regions and causing one to truthfully speak of the same as infernal instead of internal
but they were all tree physical as well as free moral agents and decided these things for themselves at last we entered the japan current and the weather was warmer and more enjoyable
on monday june fourth we saw from the deck a few drifting logs and a quantity of seaweed and these with the presence of gulls and goonies flying overhead convinced us that we were nearing land
we were not mistaken after eating an excellent six oclock dinner we went above to find ourselves between high rocky cliffs which loomed up into mountains not far distant
and we knew we were again at the aleutian islands and in the rough waters of unimak pass as we drew nearer and entered the harbor so well land locked the sun dipped low into yellow red western waters
thereby casting long shadows aslant our pathway so delicately shaded in greens the little hamlet of dutch harbor nestled cosily at the foot of the mountains which bordered the bay
and here numbers of ships lay anchored at rest passing along easily beyond another high mountain we were soon at the dock of unalaska beside other great ships in port
both groups of craft were evidently waiting for the ice to clear from behring sea before proceeding on their way northward and we counted sixteen ships of different kinds and sizes the majority of them large steamers
all were loaded with passengers and freight for nome scout boats had already been sent out to investigate and find if possible a passage through the ice fields
and the return of these scouts with good news was anxiously watched and waited for as the most desired thing at that time was a speedy and safe landing on the supposedly golden beach sands of nome
at unalaska we spent four days taking on fresh water and coal during which time passengers visited back and forth from the waiting steamers many persons having friends on other boats
and each having a curiosity to see if they were faring as well or ill as he comparing notes as to the expense of traveling with the different companies et cetera passengers on the saint paul agreed that they had no kick comin
which was one of the commonest slang phrases intended to mean that they had no fault to find with the alaska commercial company and their steamer saint paul all were well cared for and satisfied as well they might be
with the service of the ships men leaving unalaska the sun shone clear and cold upon the mountains where in places the sides looked black from the late fires started in the deep tundra by miscreants
the tops of the mountains were covered with snow down deep gorges dashed mountain waters of melting snow and ice hurrying to leap off gullied and rocky cliffs into the sea their progress was never impeded
no tree nor shrub obstructed the way with gnarled old trunks twisted roots or low hanging branches for none grow in unalaska
and the bold dignity and grandeur of the mountains is never diminished by these lesser objects as our ship sailed out into behring sea we were closely followed by the steamer george w elder whose master
an old friend of our captain had decided to follow in our wake he being less familiar than the latter with alaskan waters
on the morning of the twenty sixth of june i awoke to find that the ice had drifted out to sea in the night eight days after mollie and i had taken our twelve miles trip across the bay and return
then came hard rain and wind that for several days blew the ice back into the bay first to one side and then to the other so that the steamers waiting to come in could not do so for fear of the drifting floes
by the thirtieth of june schooners were coming into the bay with passengers and freight and the coast steamers elmore and dora had begun to make regular trips to and from nome with them came mails from the outside
with newspapers and tidings of friends in the states then our fingers trembled at opening our letters until we found that all our dear ones were well and we heartily thanked the lord
there were other white women in camp by this time and many strangers at the hotel among others officials and those in authority since the stone throwing episode the marshal had been doing duty as watchman
sleeping during the day and guarding the house nights the heavy iron bracelets in his inner coat pocket weighing scarcely more than the loaded revolver in his belt
our little sick girl being obliged now to keep her bed continually with no more playing in the sand and sunshine although her cough had left her was still the same sweet patient child she had been through all her illness
and my whole time was given to her before one of the sunny south windows of the living room we placed her cot each morning and here she received her numerous friends both eskimo and white and their names were legion
they came from the east west north and south all sorry to know of her illness and bringing presents with them sometimes it was a little live bird or squirrel a delicious salmon trout
or wild fowl for her supper sometimes it was candy nuts or fresh fruit from nome and with everything she was well pleased and joyous friends soon came in from the outside bringing city dolls dressed in ribbons and laces
there were tiny dishes chairs tables a hundred things dear to a little girls heart and all pleased her immensely but all were laid quickly aside for a basket of wild flowers or mosses
for a fish bird animal or baby showing plainly her taste for the things of nature in preference to art her love for her birthplace with its hills streams and ocean is a sincere one
and young as she is and having seen the great city by the golden gate with many of its wonders she is happiest in chinik here lives her dear old grandmother her cousins and aunts
for which she has a whole heartful of love and the sight of which is better to her than medicine during the month of july we eagerly watched the incoming steamers and welcomed all new comers who landed in chinik
many were simply passing through on their way up fish river to the mines
a few remained for the summer here men built boats and rowed away to keechawik and neukluk carrying supplies for hunting or prospecting the captains vegetable garden in the sand was growing rapidly
and was watched with eager eyes by everyone we ate lettuce and radishes picked fresh from the garden beds where they had been sown by the captains own hands and we found ageetuk and mollie to be quite famous cooks
nothing so delicious as their salads for the french cooks had long ago gone the hotel management being changed and mollie had a nice little kitchen of her own and with fresh salmon trout wild fowl
fresh meats and vegetables we made up for many months of winter dieting all this time i longed to get away i was going each day to the hill top to watch for the steamers which would bring the letters for which i waited
affairs connected with my gold claims were with
arranged as well as possible and when i boarded the steamer i would carry with me at least three deeds to as many claims with a fair prospect of others but i could not decide to remain another winter
i was determined to go to saint michael up the yukon to dawson and outside and laid my plans accordingly
the latter now grown wilful but still so bright and pretty i wanted to take both with me but no i could not the little girls work was not ended
and she is surely about to fulfill it born as she was in a rough mining camp at the foot of the barren hills she was given the eskimo name of yahkuk meaning a little hill
and she like an oasis in a desert place is left here to cheer love and help others many times i have seen evidence of the sweet and gentle influences going out from the life of little yahkuk
as she lies upon her cot of pain a tall brown miner enters the living room goes to the little bed by the window speaks softly and bending over the tiny girl kisses her
then her big black eyes glance brightly into blue ones looking down from above full red lips part in a cordial smile while the one solitary dimple in the smooth round cheek
pricks its way still deeper and small arms go up around his neck when the man turns his face wears a soft and tender expression as though he were looking at some beautiful sight far away
and perhaps he is god grant that the sweet memory of that little childs kiss may be so lasting that all their lives he and others may be purer and better men
when august came i sailed away the dora had entered the bay in the morning and found my trunk packed and waiting it was then only the work of a little time to make ready to leave
to my good missionary friends i had already said good bye and the captain and mollie were kindly regretful with tears in my eyes but with real pain in my heart i bade jennie good bye
and stepped into the little boat which was to carry me to the dora farewell then to chinik the home of the north wind and blizzard farewell to the ice fields of golovin
so tardy in leaving in summer and to keechawik and chinik whose clear rushing waters so cheered us in spring time farewell to the moss covered hills and paths thickly bordered with blossoms
farewell to my white faced friends and to the dark skinned ones
attempts to preserve the system that small frogs and toads for instance never have fallen from the sky but were on the ground in the first place or that there have been such falls up from one place in a whirlwind and down in another
were there some especially froggy place near europe as there is an especially sandy place the scientific explanation would of course be that all small frogs falling from the sky in europe come from that center of frogeity to start with
id like to emphasize something that i am permitted to see because i am still primitive or intelligent or in a state of maladjustment

july thirtieth eighteen thirty eight
little toads found in a desert after a rainfall notes and queries
to start with i do not deny positively the conventional explanation of up and down i think that there may have been such occurrences i omit many notes that i have upon indistinguishables
in the london times july fourth eighteen eighty three there is an account of a shower of twigs and leaves and tiny toads in a storm upon the slopes of the apennines these may have been the ejectamenta of a whirlwind i add however
that i have notes upon two other falls of tiny toads in eighteen eighty three one in france and one in tahiti also of fish in scotland but in the phenomenon of the apennines the mixture seems to me to be typical of the products of a whirlwind
the other instances seem to me to be typical of something like migration their great numbers and their homogeneity over and over in these annals of the damned occurs the datum of segregation
but a whirlwind is thought of as a condition of chaos quasi chaos
monthly weather review july eighteen eighty one a small pond in the track of the cloud was sucked dry the water being carried over the adjoining fields together with a large quantity of soft mud which was scattered over the ground for half a mile around
but here are the circumstances of a scoop in the exclusionist imagination there is no regard for mud debris from the bottom of a pond floating vegetation loose things from the shores but a precise picking out of frogs only
of all instances i have that attribute the fall of small frogs or toads to whirlwinds only one definitely identifies or places the whirlwind also as has been said before a pond going up would be quite as interesting as frogs coming down
whirlwinds we read of over and over but where and what whirlwind it seems to me that anybody who had lost a pond would be heard from in symons meteorological magazine
a fall of small frogs near birmingham england june thirtieth eighteen ninety two is attributed to a specific whirlwind but not a word as to any special pond that had contributed
and something that strikes my attention here is that these frogs are described as almost white im afraid there is no escape for us we shall have to give to civilization upon this earth some new worlds places with white frogs in them
in spite of all we think we know of the accelerative velocity of falling bodies and have propagated why the exotic becomes the indigenous or from the strangest of places wed expect the familiar or
if hosts of living frogs have come here from somewhere else every living thing upon this earth may ancestrally have come from somewhere else i find that i have another note upon a specific hurricane
after one of the greatest hurricanes in the history of ireland some fish were found as far as fifteen yards from the edge of a lake have another this is a good one for the exclusionists fall of fish in paris said that a neighboring pond had been blown dry
date not given but i have seen it recorded somewhere else the best known fall of fishes from the sky is that which occurred at mountain ash
february eleventh eighteen fifty nine the editor of the zoologist
having published a report of a fall of fishes writes i am continually receiving similar accounts of frogs and fishes but in all the volumes of the zoologist i can find only two reports of such falls there is nothing to conclude
other than that hosts of data have been lost because orthodoxy does not look favorably upon such reports the monthly weather review records several falls of fishes in the united states
nevertheless the treatment by the zoologist of the fall reported from mountain ash is fair first appears
vicar of abedare asserting that the fall had occurred chiefly upon the property of mister nixon of mountain ash
of the british museum bristling with exclusionism writes that some of these fishes which had been sent to him alive were very young minnows he says on reading the evidence it seems to me most probably only a practical joke
the editor says that one was a minnow and that the rest were sticklebacks he says that doctor grays explanation is no doubt right but
he publishes a letter from another correspondent who apologizes for opposing so high an authority as doctor gray but says that he had obtained some of these fishes from persons who lived at a considerable distance apart
or considerably out of range of the playful pail of water according to the annual register
the fishes themselves had fallen by pailfuls if these fishes were not upon the ground in the first place we base our objections to the whirlwind explanation upon two data that they fell in no such distribution as one could attribute to the discharge of a whirlwind
that ten minutes later another fall of fishes occurred upon this same narrow strip of land even arguing that a whirlwind may stand still axially it discharges tangentially wherever the fishes came from it does not seem thinkable
that some could have fallen and that others could have whirled even a tenth of a minute then falling directly after the first to fall because of these evil circumstances the best adaptation was to laugh the whole thing off
very young minnows had been caught up in the london times march second eighteen fifty nine is a letter from mister aaron roberts curate of saint peters carmathon in this letter
but there is some question of species i think myself that they were minnows and sticklebacks some persons thinking them to be sea fishes placed them in salt water according to mister roberts
some were placed in fresh water these seemed to thrive well as to narrow distribution we are told that the fishes fell in and about the premises of mister nixon it was not observed at the time that any fish fell in any other part of the neighborhood
save in the particular spot mentioned in the london times march tenth eighteen fifty nine vicar griffith writes an account the roofs of some houses were covered with them
in this letter it is said that the largest fishes were five inches long and that these did not survive the fall report of the british association
the evidence of the fall of fish on this occasion was very conclusive a specimen of the fish was exhibited
leirus gasterosteus is the stickleback altogether i think we have not a sense of total perdition
in which were thousands of fishes four or five inches long some of which covered roofs of houses and some of which remained ten minutes in the air by way of contrast we offer our own acceptance that the bottom of a super geographical pond had dropped out
i have a great many notes upon the fall of fishes despite the difficulty these records have in getting themselves published but i pick out the instances that especially relate to our super geographical acceptances
that have fallen with a distribution narrower than is attributable to a whirlwind that have fallen for a considerable length of time upon the same narrow area of land these three factors indicate somewhere not far aloft
a region of inertness to this earths gravitation of course however a region that by the flux and variation of all things must at times be susceptible but afterward our heresy will bifurcate
in amiable accommodation to the crucifixion itll get i think but so impressed are we with the datum that though there have been many reports of small frogs that have fallen from the sky
that to these circumstances another adjustment must be made apart from our three factors of indication an extraordinary observation is the fall of living things without injury to them
something else apart from our three main interests is a phenomenon that looks like what one might call an alternating series of falls of fishes whatever the significance may be

disregarding serial significance or mechanical unintelligent repulsive reflex is that the fishes of india did not fall from the sky that they were found upon the ground after torrential rains because streams had overflowed and had then receded
in the region of inertness that we think we can conceive of or a zone that is to this earths gravitation very much like the neutral zone of a magnets attraction we accept that there are bodies of water and also clear spaces bottoms of ponds dropping out
remain and dry or even putrefy then sometimes falling by atmospheric dislodgment after a tremendous deluge of rain one of the heaviest falls on record
july twenty fifth eighteen fifty
the word found is agreeable to the repulsions of the conventionalists and their concept of an overflowing stream but according to doctor buist some of these fishes were found on the tops of haystacks ferrel
tells of a fall of living fishes some of them having been placed in a tank where they survived that occurred in india about twenty miles south of calcutta september twentieth eighteen thirty nine a witness of this fall says
the most strange thing which ever struck me was that the fish did not fall helter skelter or here and there but they fell in a straight line not more than a cubit in breadth
that according to testimony taken before a magistrate a fall occurred february nineteenth eighteen thirty near feridpoor india of many fishes of various sizes some whole and fresh and others mutilated and putrefying
or to those who hold out for segregation in a whirlwind or that objects say twice as heavy as others would be separated from the lighter we point out that some of these fishes were twice as heavy as others in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal
some of the fish were fresh but others were rotten and without heads among the number which i got five were fresh and the rest stinking and headless they remind us of his graces observation of some pages back
according to doctor buist some of these fishes weighed one and a half pounds each and others three pounds a fall of fishes at futtepoor india may sixteenth eighteen thirty three they were all dead and dry
a correspondent writes from the dove marine laboratory cuttercoats england that at hindon a suburb of sunderland august twenty fourth nineteen eighteen hundreds of small fishes identified as sand eels had fallen
again the small area about sixty by thirty yards the fall occurred during a heavy rain that was accompanied by thunder
but by no visible lightning the sea is close to hindon but if you try to think of these fishes having described a trajectory in a whirlwind from the ocean consider this remarkable datum that
according to witnesses the fall upon this small area occupied ten minutes i cannot think of a clearer indication of a direct fall from a stationary source and
the fish were all dead and indeed stiff and hard when picked up immediately after the occurrence by all of which i mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of things that fall from a stationary source overhead
well have to take up the subject from many approaches before our acceptance which seems quite as rigorously arrived at as ever has been a belief can emerge from the accursed i dont know how much the horse and the barn will help us to emerge
but if ever anything did go up from this earths surface and stay up those damned things may have monthly weather review may eighteen seventy eight in a tornado in wisconsin may twenty third eighteen seventy eight
a barn and a horse were carried completely away and neither horse nor barn nor any portion of either have since been found after that which would be a little strong were it not for a steady improvement in our digestions that i note as we go along
there is little of the bizarre or the unassimilable in the turtle that hovered six months or so over a small town in mississippi monthly weather review may eighteen ninety four
fell a small piece of alabaster that at bovina eight miles from vicksburg fell a gopher turtle they fell in a hailstorm this item was widely copied at the time for instance nature
as to discussion not a word or science and its continuity with presbyterianism data like this are damned at birth the weather review does sprinkle or baptize or attempt to save this infant
but in all the meteorological literature that i have gone through after that date not a word except mention once or twice the editor of the review says
an examination of the weather map shows that these hailstorms occur on the south side of a region of cold northerly winds and were but a small part of a series of similar storms
of all incredibilities that we have to choose from i give first place to a notion of a whirlwind pouncing upon a region
this time the other mechanical thing there in the first place cannot rise in response to its stimulus it is resisted in that these objects were coated with ice month of may in a southern state if a whirlwind at all
there must have been very limited selection there is no record of the fall of other objects but there is no attempt in the review to specify a whirlwind these strangely associated things were remarkably separated they fell eight miles apart
then as if there were real reasoning they must have been high to fall with such divergence or one of them must have been carried partly horizontally eight miles farther than the other but either supposition argues for power more than that of a local whirl or gust
or argues for a great specific disturbance of which there is no record for the month of may eighteen ninety four
then i think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of mississippi weeks or months before may eleventh eighteen ninety four no i dont look for it and inevitably find it or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up indefinitely
but may after a while be shaken down by storms
so then that the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different origins from different worlds perhaps have entered a region of suspension over this earth wafting near each other long duration
final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance with hail or that hailstones too when large are phenomena of suspension of long duration that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could become so great only in falling from the clouds
long duration other indications of long duration i think of a region somewhere above this earths surface in which gravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the distance
quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from a magnet theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with the square of the distance but the falling off is found to be almost abrupt at a short distance
horses and barns and elephants and flies and dodoes moas and pterodactyls leaves from modern trees and leaves of the carboniferous era all however tending to disintegrate into homogeneous looking muds or dusts
red or black or yellow treasure troves for the palaeontologists and for the archaeologists accumulations of centuries cyclones of egypt greece and assyria fishes dried and hard there a short time others there long enough to putrefy
but the omnipresence of heterogeneity or living fishes also ponds of fresh water oceans of salt water as to the law of gravitation i prefer to take one simple stand
orthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces gravitation is one of these forces all other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness irrespective of distance as well as of attraction
but newtonian gravitation admits attraction only then newtonian gravitation can be only one third acceptable even to the orthodox or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of forces or still simpler here are the data
though it harmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary source and of course with other data too is inadequate to account for two peculiarities of the falls of frogs that never has a fall of tadpoles been reported
that never has a fall of full grown frogs been reported always frogs a few months old it sounds positive but if there be such reports they are somewhere out of my range of reading but tadpoles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would frogs
little or big if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds and more likely to fall from the super sargasso sea if though very tentatively and provisionally we accept the super sargasso sea
before we take up an especial expression upon the fall of immature and larval forms of life to this earth and the necessity then of conceiving of some factor besides mere stationariness or suspension or stagnation
there are other data that are similar to data of falls of fishes science gossip
that small snails of a land species had fallen near redruth cornwall july eighth eighteen eighty six during a heavy thunderstorm roads and fields strewn with them so that they were gathered up by the hatful
none seen to fall by the writer of this account snails said to be quite different to any previously known in this district
of great and deserved repute i thought i should for once like to trace the origin of one of these fabulous tales our own acceptance is that justice cannot be in an intermediate existence
in which there can be approximation only to justice or to injustice that to be fair is to have no opinion at all that to be honest is to be uninterested that to investigate is to admit prejudice that nobody has ever really investigated anything
but has always sought positively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of or suspected in advance as i suspected says this correspondent i found that the snails were of a familiar land species that they had been upon the ground
in the first place he found that the snails had appeared after the rain that astonished rustics had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen he met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall this was his error says the investigator
in such quantities that they were shoveled up it is said that the snails may be considered as a local species
and that in his opinion they had been upon the ground in the first place but that there had been some unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon the curious azure blue appearance of the sun at the time
that according to das wetter december eighteen ninety two upon august ninth eighteen ninety two a yellow cloud appeared over paderborn germany from this cloud fell a torrential rain in which were hundreds of mussels
there is no mention of whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place nor of a whirlwind lizards
that during a heavy shower july third eighteen sixty he heard a peculiar sound at his feet and looking down saw a snake lying as if stunned by a fall it then came to life gray snake about a foot long
these data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation you please but in the matter of the fall that occurred at memphis tennessee occur some strong significances
our quasi reasoning upon this subject applies to all segregations so far considered monthly weather review january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven that
rather strictly localized or in a space of two blocks and after a violent storm in which the rain fell in torrents snakes were found they were crawling on sidewalks in yards and in streets and in masses
but none were found on roofs or any other elevation above ground and none were seen to fall if you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there or had been upon the ground in the first place and that it was only that something occurred to call special attention to them
in the streets of memphis january fifteenth eighteen seventy seven why thats sensible thats the common sense that has been against us from the first it is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not
and had not been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses in the first place if we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other part of this earths surface in a whirlwind if we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them
stones fence rails limbs of trees say that the snakes occupied the next gradation and would be the next to fall
again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes with stones and earth and an infinitude of other debris snatching up dozens of snakes
i dont know how many to a den hundreds maybe but according to the account of this occurrence in the new york times there were thousands of them alive from one foot to eighteen inches in length
records the fall and says that there were thousands of them the usual whirlwind explanation is given but in what locality snakes exist in such abundance is yet a mystery this matter of enormousness of numbers
suggests to me something of a migratory nature but that snakes in the united states do not migrate in the month of january if ever as to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky prevailing notions of swarming would seem explanatory enough
fall of fishes june thirteenth eighteen eighty nine in holland ants august first eighteen eighty nine strasbourg little toads august second eighteen eighty nine savoy
fall of ants cambridge england summer of eighteen seventy four some were wingless
enormous fall of ants nancy france july twenty first eighteen eighty seven most of them were wingless
and finds a fair margin of profit in shoving it theres a chance for everything you have learned from latin to poetry in the packing business though we dont use much poetry here except in our street car ads
and about the only time our products are given latin names is when the state board of health condemns them so i think youll find it safe to go short a little on the frills of education if you want them bad enough youll find a way to pick them up later after business hours
but i wanted you to form good mental habits just as i want you to have clean straight physical ones because i was run through a threshing machine when i was a boy and didnt begin to get the straw out of my hair till i was past thirty
i havent any sympathy with a lot of these old fellows who go around bragging of their ignorance and saying that boys dont need to know anything except addition and the best policy brand of honesty we started in a mighty different world and we were all ignorant together
the lord let us in on the ground floor gave us corner lots and then started in to improve the adjacent property we didnt have to know fractions to figure out our profits now a merchant needs astronomy to see them and when he locates them they are out somewhere near the fifth decimal place
and therere just as many chances for a fellow as ever but theyre a little gun shy and you cant catch them by any such coarse method as putting salt on their tails thirty years ago you could take an old muzzle loader and knock over plenty of ducks in the city limits
and chicago wasnt cook county then either you can get them still but youve got to go to kankakee and take a hammerless along and when i started in the packing business it was all straight sailing no frills just turning hogs into hog meat
dry salt for the niggers down south and sugar cured for the white folks up north everything else was sausage or thrown away but when we get through with a hog nowadays hes scattered through a hundred different cans and packages and hes all accounted for what we used to throw away is our profit
it takes doctors lawyers engineers poets and i dont know what to run the business and i reckon that improvements which call for parsons will be creeping in next naturally a young man who expects to hold his own when he is thrown in with a lot of men like these
must be as clean and sharp as a hounds tooth or some other fellows simply going to eat him up the first college man i ever hired was old john durhams son jim that was a good many years ago when the house was a much smaller affair
but old durham found out what every one learns who gets his ambitions mixed up with number two red that theres a heap of it lying around loose in the country the bears did quick work and kept the cash wheat coming in so lively that one settling day
and that he had better turn his attention to the stocks of mess pork
he applied for every other position on the premises right down to office boy i told him i was sorry but i couldnt do anything for him then that we were letting men go but id keep him in mind and so on
finally after about a month of this he wore me down so that i stopped him one day as he was passing me on the street i thought id find out if he really was so red hot to work as he pretended to be
besides i felt that perhaps i hadnt treated the boy just right as i had delivered quite a jag of that wheat to his father myself hello jim i called do you still want that job yes sir he answered quick as lightning well
i tell you how it is jim i said looking up at him he was one of those husky lazy moving six footers i dont see any chance in the office but i understand they can use another good strong man in one of the loading gangs
i thought that would settle jim and let me out for its no joke lugging beef or rolling barrels and tierces a hundred yards or so to the cars but jim came right back at me with done wholl i report to
that sporty way of answering as if he was closing a bet made me surer than ever that he was not cut out for a butcher but i told him and off he started hot foot to find the foreman i sent word by another route to see that he got plenty to do
he got to scheming around for a way to make the work easier and he hit on an idea for a sort of overhead railroad system by which the barrels could be swung out of the storerooms and run right along into the cars
it was just as i thought jim was lazy but he had put the house in the way of saving so much money that i couldnt fire him so i raised his salary and made him an assistant timekeeper and checker
jim kept at this for three or four months until his feet began to hurt him i guess and then he was out of a job again it seems he had heard something of a new machine for registering the men that did away with most of the timekeepers except the fellows who watched the machines
of course he claimed a raise again for effecting such a saving
i was beginning to take an interest in jim so i brought him up into the office and set him to copying circular letters we used to send out a raft of them to the trade that was just before the general adoption of typewriters when they were still in the experimental stage
but jim hadnt been in the office plugging away at the letters for a month before he had the writers cramp and began nosing around again the first thing i knew he was sicking the agents for the new typewriting machine on to me
and he kept them pounding away until they had made me give them a trial then it was all up with mister jims job again
jim made two trips without selling enough to keep them working overtime at the factory and then he came into my office with a long story about how we were doing it all wrong said we ought to go for the consumer by advertising
but jim just kept plugging away at me between trips until finally i took him off the road and told him to go ahead and try it in a small way jim pretty nearly scared me to death that first year
at last he had got into something that he took an interest in spending money and he just fairly wallowed in it used to lay awake nights thinking up new ways of getting rid of the old mans profits
i remember one picture he got out showing sixteen cows standing between something that looked like a letter press and telling how every pound or so of grahams extract contained the juice squeezed from a herd of steers if an explorer started for the north pole
jim would send him a case of extract and then advertise that it was the great heat maker for cold climates and if some other fellow started across africa he sent him a case too and advertised what a bully drink it was served up with a little ice
he broke out in a new place every day and every time he broke out it cost the house money finally i made up my mind to swallow the loss and mister jim was just about to lose his job sure enough
when the orders for extract began to look up and he got a reprieve then he began to make expenses and he got a pardon and finally a rush came that left him high and dry in a permanent place
jim was all right in his way but it was a new way and i hadnt been broad gauged enough to see that it was a better way that was where i caught the connection between a college education and business
ive always made it a rule to buy brains and ive learned now that the better trained they are the faster they find reasons for getting their salaries raised the fellow who hasnt had the training may be just as smart but hes apt to paw the air when hes reaching for ideas
i suppose youre asking why if im so hot for education im against this post graduate course
i see youve been elected president of your class im glad the boys arent down on you but while the most popular man in his class isnt always a failure in business being as popular as that takes up a heap of time
i noticed too when you were home easter that you were running to sporty clothes and cigarettes theres nothing criminal about either but i dont hire sporty clerks at all and the only part of the premises on which cigarette smoking is allowed is the fertilizer factory
i simply mention this in passing i have every confidence in your ultimate good sense and i guess youll see the point without my elaborating with a meat ax my reasons for thinking that youve had enough college for the present
i never sell goods without knowing where i can find them when i want them and if these fellows try to put their forefeet in the trough or start any shoving and crowding theyre going to find me forgetting my table manners too
for when it comes to funny business im something of a humorist myself and while im too old to run im young enough to stand and fight first and last a good many men have gone gunning for me but theyve always planned the obsequies before they caught the deceased
i reckon there hasnt been a time in twenty years when there wasnt a nice gates ajar piece all made up and ready for me in some office near the board of trade but the first essential of a quiet funeral is a willing corpse and im still sitting up and taking nourishment
abuse and flattery the first cant harm you and the second cant help you some men are like yellow dogs
last year when i was bulling the market the longs all said that i was a kind hearted old philanthropist who was laying awake nights scheming to get the farmers a top price for their hogs
and the shorts allowed that i was an infamous old robber who was stealing the pork out of the workingmans pot as long as you cant please both sides in this world theres nothing like pleasing your own side
i remember once i had a vacant lot out on the avenue and a lady came in to my office and in a soothing syrupy way asked if i would lend it to her as she wanted to build a creche on it i hesitated a little because i had never heard of a creche before
and someways it sounded sort of foreign and frisky though the woman looked like a good safe reliable old heifer but she explained that a creche was a baby farm where old maids went to wash and feed and stick pins in other peoples children while their mothers were off at work
of course there was nothing in that to get our pastor or the police after me so i told her to go ahead she went off happy but about a week later she dropped in again looking sort of dissatisfied to find out if i wouldnt build the creche itself
it seemed like a worthy object so i sent some carpenters over to knock together a long frame pavilion she was mighty grateful you bet and i didnt see her again for a fortnight then she called by to say that so long as i was in the business and they didnt cost me anything special
would i mind giving her a few cows she had a surprised and grieved expression on her face as she talked and the way she put it made me feel that i ought to be ashamed of myself for not having thought of the live stock myself so i threw in half a dozen cows to provide the refreshments
to ask why i hadnt had it painted i was too busy that morning to quarrel so i sent word that i would fix it up and when i was driving by there next day the painters were hard at work on it
grahams extract it makes the weak strong
went all around town saying that i had given a five hundred dollar shed to charity and painted a thousand dollar ad on it allowed i ought to send my check for that amount to the creche fund kept at it till i began to think there might be something in it after all and sent her the money
then i found a fellow who wanted to build in that neighborhood sold him the lot cheap and got out of the creche industry
but the only thing ive ever put into it which didnt draw dividends in fun or dollars was worry that is a branch of the trade which you want to leave to our competitors ive always found worrying a blamed sight more uncertain than horse racing its harder to pick a winner at it
you go home worrying because youre afraid that your fool new clerk forgot to lock the safe after you and during the night the lard refinery burns down you spend a year fretting because you think bill jones is going to cut you out with your best girl and then you spend ten worrying because he didnt
a busy man has no time to bother with it he can always find plenty of old women in skirts or trousers to spend their days worrying over their own troubles and to sit up nights waking his speaking of handing over your worries to others naturally calls to mind the widow williams and her son bud
who was a playmate of mine when i was a boy bud was the youngest of the widows troubles and she was a woman whose troubles seldom came singly had fourteen altogether and four pair of em were twins
and then shed shed all worry over them for the rest of the day allowed that if they got hurt the neighbors would bring them home
and someways the whole drove always showed up safe and dirty about meal time
and so when buds clothes were found at the swimming hole one day and no bud inside them she didnt take on up to the expectations of the neighbors who had brought the news and who were standing around waiting for her to go off into something special in the way of high strikes
hinted that thered be no funeral or such like expensive goings on until some one produced the deceased take her by and large she was a pretty cool calm cucumber
and every one just quit work to tell each other what a noble little fellow he was and how his mother hadnt deserved to have such a bright little sunbeam in her home and to drag the river between talks but they couldnt get a rise
but finally at the end of a week when theyd strained the whole river through their drags and hadnt anything to show for it but a collection of tin cans and dead catfish
and went down the street to the cabin of louisiana clytemnestra an old yellow woman who would go into a trance for four bits and find a fortune for you for a dollar i reckon shed have called herself a clairvoyant nowadays but then she was just a voodoo woman
well the widow said she reckoned that boys ought to be let out as well as in for half price and so she laid down two bits allowing that she wanted a few minutes private conversation with her bud
clytie said shed do her best but that spirits were mighty snifty and high toned even when theyd only been poor white trash on earth and it might make them mad to be called away from their high jinks if they were taking a little recreation or from their high priced new york customers if they were working
but next day she came again and paid down four bits and clytie reckoned that that ought to fetch bud sure someways though she didnt have any luck and finally the widow suggested that she call up buds father buck williams had been dead a matter of ten years
and the old man responded promptly wheres bud asked the widow
no then hed have to look downstairs for him clytie told the widow to call again and theyd get him sure so she came back next day and laid down a dollar that fetched old buck williams ghost on the jump you bet
but they couldnt get a whisper even from bud i reckon clytie had been stringing the old lady along intending to produce buds spook as a sort of red fire calcium light grand march of the amazons climax but she didnt get a chance
for right there the old lady got up with a mighty set expression around her lips and marched out muttering that it was just as she had thought all along bud wasnt there and when the neighbors dropped in that afternoon to plan out a memorial service for her lost lamb
she chased them off the lot with a broom
and that they would just stand pat now and wait for him to make the next move
but there wouldnt be till then altogether it looked as if there was a heap of trouble coming to bud if he had made any mistake and was still alive the widow found her lost lamb hiding behind a rain barrel when she opened up the house next morning
and there was a mighty touching and affecting scene in fact the widow must have touched him at least a hundred times and every time he was affected to tears for she was using a bed slat which is a powerfully strong moral agent for making a boy see the error of his ways
and it was a month after that before bud could go down main street without some man who had called him a noble little fellow or a bright manly little chap while he was drowned reaching out and fetching him a clip on the ear for having come back and put the laugh on him
but it appeared that he left home to get a few indian scalps and that he came back for a little bacon and corn pone i simply mention the widow in passing as an example of the fact that the time to do your worrying is when a thing is all over and that the way to do it is to leave it to the neighbors
i sail for home to morrow
mantelish excused himself and went off with the messenger the door closed quillan came back to his chair were moving the outfit later tonight the commissioner explained
eight tons of his lab equipment plus his special u league guards oh trigger picked up the puya glass she looked into it it was empty moving where she asked manon said the commissioner tell you about that later
every last muscle in triggers body seemed to go limp simultaneously she settled back slightly in the chair surprised by the force of the reaction she hadnt realized by now how keyed up she was she sighed a small sigh
then she smiled at quillan major she said how about a tiny little refill on that puya about half quillan took care of the tiny little refill commissioner tate said by the way
quillan does have a degree in subspace engineering and gets assigned to the engineers now and then but his real jobs space scout intelligence trigger nodded id almost guessed it she gave quillan another smile
and now said the commissioner well talk more freely we tell mantelish just as little as we can to tell you the truth trigger the professor is a terrible handicap on an operation like this i understand he was a great friend of your fathers yes she said
going over for visits to mantelishs garden with my father is one of the earliest things i remember i can imagine hes a problem she shifted her gaze curiously from one to the other of the two men what are you people doing
looking for gess fayle and the key unit holati tate said thats about it were one of a few thousand federation groups assigned to the same general job each group works at its specialties and the information gets correlated
in what way trigger asked well suppose that key unit is lost and stays lost suppose all the other plasmoids put together dont contain enough information to show how the old galactics produced the things and got them to operate
somebody would get that worked out pretty soon wouldnt they
there seem to be too many basic factors missing it might be necessary to develop a whole new class of sciences first and that could take a few centuries well trigger admitted i could get along without the things indefinitely
same here the plasmoid nabob agreed ungratefully weird beasties but lets see at present there are twelve hundred and fifty eight member worlds to the federation arent there more or less
and the number of planetary confederacies subplanetary governments industrial financial and commercial combines assorted power groups et cetera and so on is something id hate to have to calculate what are you driving at she asked
theyve all been told were heading for a new golden age courtesy of the plasmoid science practically everybody has believed it now theres considerable doubt
of course practically everybody is going to get very unhappy eh that said commissioner tate is only a little of it yes the thing isnt just lost somebodys got it very likely trigger nodded
so any one of umpteen thousands of organizations in the hub might be the one that has that plasmoid now including said holati any one of the two hundred and fourteen restricted worlds
their treaties of limitation wouldnt have let them get into the plasmoid pie until the others had been at it a decade or so they would have been quite eager there was a little pause then trigger said lordy
the thing could even set off another string of wars thats a point the council is nervous about he said well it certainly is a mess you would have thought the federation might have had a security chief in on that first operation
right there on harvest moon they did he said it was fayle
holati could those things ever become as valuable as people keep saying its all sounded a little exaggerated to me the commissioner said hed wondered about it too
im not enough of a biologist to make an educated guess what it seems to boil down to is that they might which would be enough to tempt a lot of people to gamble very high for a chance to get control of the plasmoid process
and we know definitely that some people are gambling for it how do you know weve been working a couple of leads here pretty short leads so far but you work with what you can get he nodded at the table
trigger glanced down the plasmoid lay there some inches from the side of her hand you know she said uncomfortably old repulsive moved again while we were talking towards my hand she drew the hand away
i was watching it major quillan said reassuringly from the end of the table
mantelish brought it back to maccadon with him
he was curious because he couldnt even guess at what its function was it was just lying there in a cubicle so he did considerable experimenting with it while he waited for gess fayle to show up
and league headquarters fidgeted around hoping to get the kind of report from mantelish and fayle that mantelish thought theyd already received they were wondering where fayle was too but they knew fayle was security so they didnt like to get too nosy
trigger shook her head wonderful so
mantelish began to get results with it the commissioner said one experiment was rather startling hed been trying that electrical stimulation business nothing happened until he had finished then he touched the plasmoid and it fed the whole charge back to him
she laughed delightedly good for repulsive stood up for his rights eh mantelish gained some such impression anyway he became more cautious with it after that and then he learned something that should be important
he was visiting another lab where they had a couple of plasmoids which actually moved now and then
the two lab plasmoids stopped moving while he was there they havent moved since
right he thought about that and then located another moving plasmoid
the big one induces plasmoid activity the little one modifies it
but his two lab guards and one of the raiders were killed the others got away gess fayles defection was a certainty by then and everybody was very nervous the feds got there fast and dead brained the raider they learned just two things
one hed been mind blocked and couldnt have spilled any significant information even if they had got him alive the other item they drew from his brain was a clear impression of the target of the raid the professors pal here uh huh trigger said lost in thought
she poked repulsive lightly that would be fayle and his associates then or somebody who knew about them did they want to kill it or grab it the commissioner looked at her grab it was the dead brain report why
so they need it in connection with the key unit trigger asked probably that makes everything look very much better doesnt it quite a little he said the unit may not work
mantelish talks of something he calls proximity influence
so trigger said they might have two thirds of what everybody wants and you might have one third right here on the table how many of the later raiders did you catch all of them said the commissioner around forty
we got them dead we got them alive it didnt make much difference they were hired hands very expensive hired hands but still just that most of them didnt know a thing we could use the ones that did know something were mind blocked again
i thought trigger said reflectively you could un block someone like that you can sometimes if youre very good at it and if you have time enough we couldnt afford to wait a year they died before they could tell us anything
there was a pause then trigger asked how did you get involved in this personally more or less by accident the commissioner said it was in connection with our second lead thats me huh she said unhappily yes
why would anyone want to grab me i dont know anything he shook his head we havent found out yet were hoping we will in a very few days is that one of the things you cant tell me about
i can tell you most of what i know at the moment said the commissioner
administration terrorism the administration tried in another way to stop picketing
the agitation would certainly weaken so thought the administration to their great surprise however in the face of that reckless and extreme sentence the longest picket line of the entire campaign formed at the white house in the late afternoon of november tenth
forty one women picketed in protest against this wanton persecution of their leader as well as against the delay in passing the amendment face to face with an embarrassing number of prisoners the administration used its wits and decided
to reduce the number to a manageable size before imprisoning this group failing of that they tried still another way out they resorted to imprisonment with terrorism

as she said in court we took this action with great consecration of spirit with willingness to sacrifice personal liberty
judge mullowny addressed the prisoners with many high sounding words about the seriousness of obstructing the traffic in the national capital and inadvertently slipped into a discourse on russia and the dangers of revolution
but their minds were too full of the political aspect of our offense to conceal it the truth of the situation is that the court has not been given power to meet it the judge lamented it is very very puzzling i find you guilty of the offense charged
but will take the matter of sentence under advisement and so the guilty pickets were summarily released the administration did not relish the incarceration of forty one women for another reason than limited housing accommodations
forty one women representing sixteen states in the union might create a considerable political dislocation but these same forty one women were determined to force the administration to take its choice it could allow them to continue their peaceful agitation
or it could stand the reaction which was bound to come from imprisoning them and so the forty one women returned to the white house gates to resume their picketing they stood guard several minutes before the police taken unawares could summon sufficient force to arrest them
come back on friday i am not yet prepared to try the case logic dictated that either we had a right to stand at the gates with our banners or we did not have that right
it had to stop picketing whether this was done legally or illegally logically or illogically clumsily or dexterously was of secondary importance picketing must be stopped
using their welcome release to continue their protest the women again marched with their banners to the white house in an attempt to picket again they were arrested no one who saw that line will ever forget the impression it made not only on friends of the suffragists
but on the general populace of washington to see these women force with such magnificent defiance the hand of a wavering administration on the following morning
miss burns received six months in pronouncing the lightest sentence upon missus nolan the judge said that he did so on account of her age he urged her however to pay her fine hinting that jail might be too severe on her and might bring on death
at this suggestion tiny missus nolan pulled herself up on her toes and said with great dignity
i have a nephew fighting for democracy in france
i should be ashamed if i did not join these brave women in their fight for democracy in america i should be proud of the honor to die in prison
for the liberty of american women
or do prison labor any words of mine would be inadequate to tell the story of the prisoners reception at the occoquan workhouse the following is the statement of missus nolan dictated upon her release in the presence of mister dudley field malone
missus herndon was standing behind a desk when we were brought into this office and there were five or six men also in the room
said she must speak to whittaker the superintendent of the place
missus herndon called my name but i did not answer
as they ran me past she was lying there with her arms out and we heard one of the men yell the suffrager my mother aint no suffrager ill put you through at the end of the corridor
they pushed me through a door then i lost my balance and fell against the iron bed missus cosu struck the wall then they threw in two mats and two dirty blankets
the door was barred from top to bottom
missus cosu would not let me lie on the floor she put me on the couch and stretched out on the floor on one of the two pads they threw in
when missus lewis doubled over and handled like a sack of something
and only half conscious until morning
i bade them both good by
they took me to mister whittakers office
youre missus mary nolan said whittaker
i said no dont you know now that i am mister whittaker the superintendent he asked is there any age limit to your workhouse i said would a woman of seventy three or a child of two be sent here
i think i made him think he motioned to the guard get a doctor to examine her he said in the hospital cottage
a negro trusty was there i fell back again into the same stupor the next day they brought me some toast and a plate of food the first i had been offered in over thirty six hours
i just looked at the food and motioned it away it made me sick i was released on the sixth day and passed the dispensary as i came out
and many others they had on coarse striped dresses and big grotesque heavy shoes i burst into tears as they led me away
november twenty first nineteen seventeen the day following their commitment to occoquan mister obrien of counsel was directed to see the women to ascertain their condition
friends and relatives were alarmed as not a line of news had been allowed to penetrate to the world mister obrien was denied admission and forced to come back to washington without any report whatsoever
the next day mister obrien again attempted to see his clients as did also the mother of miss matilda young the youngest prisoner in mister whittakers care
who went asking to see her mother miss morey was held under armed guard half a mile from the prison admission was denied to all of them
the terrible anxiety at headquarters was not relieved the third day by a report brought from the workhouse by one of the marines stationed at quantico station virginia who had been summoned to the workhouse on the night the women arrived
he brought news that unknown tortures were going on mister obrien immediately forced his way through by a court order
and which was being continued at that moment miss lucy burns who had assumed responsibility for the welfare of the women had managed to secrete small scraps of paper and a tiny pencil and jot down briefly the day by day events at the workhouse
this week of brutality which rivaled old russia if it did not outstrip it was almost the blackest page in the administrations cruel fight against women here are some of the scraps of miss burns day by day log
smuggled out of the workhouse miss burns is so gifted a writer that i feel apologetic for using these scraps in their raw form but i know she will forgive me wednesday
november fourteenth demanded to see superintendent whittaker request refused missus herndon the matron said we would have to wait up all night one of the men guards said he would put us in sardine box and put mustard on us
superintendent whittaker came at nine p m he refused to hear our demand for political rights seized by guards from behind flung off my feet and shot out of the room
all of us were seized by men guards and dragged to cells in mens part dorothy day was roughly used back twisted missus mary a nolan seventy three year old picket from jacksonville florida flung into cell
i slept with dorothy day in a single bed i was handcuffed all night and manacled to the bars part of the time for asking the others how they were and was threatened with a straitjacket and a buckle gag thursday november sixteenth
asked for whittaker who came he seized julia emory by the back of her neck and threw her into the room very brutally she is a little girl i asked for counsel to learn the status of the case i was told to shut up and was again threatened with a straitjacket and a buckle gag
later i was taken to put on prison clothes refused and resisted strenuously
when miss lucy burns and missus lawrence lewis were so weak that mister whittaker feared their death they were forcibly fed and taken immediately to the jail in washington of the experience missus lewis wrote i was seized
and laid on my back where five people held me a young colored woman leaping upon my knees which seemed to break under the weight doctor gannon then forced the tube through my lips and down my throat i gasping and suffocating with the agony of it
i didnt know where to breathe from and everything turned black when the fluid began pouring in i was moaning and making the most awful sounds quite against my will for i did not wish to disturb my friends in the next room finally
the tube was withdrawn i lay motionless after a while i was dressed and carried in a chair to a waiting automobile laid on the back seat and driven into washington to the jail hospital previous to the feeding
i had been forcibly examined by doctor gannon i protesting that i wished a woman physician of this experience miss burns wrote on tiny scraps of paper wednesday
yesterday afternoon at about four or five missus lewis and i were asked to go to the operating room went there and found our clothes told we were to go to washington no reason as usual when we were dressed doctor gannon appeared
and said he wished to examine us both refused were dragged through halls by force our clothing partly removed by force and we were examined heart tested blood pressure and pulse taken of course such data was of no value after such a struggle doctor gannon told me then i must be fed
was stretched on bed two doctors matron four colored prisoners present whittaker in hall i was held down by five people at legs arms and head i refused to open mouth gannon pushed tube up left nostril
i turned and twisted my head all i could but he managed to push it up it hurts nose and throat very much and makes nose bleed freely tube drawn out covered with blood operation leaves one very sick
left nostril throat and muscles of neck very sore all night after this i was brought into the hospital in an ambulance missus lewis and i placed in same room slept hardly at all this morning doctor ladd appeared with his tube
missus lewis and i said we would not be forcibly fed said he would call in men guards and force us to submit went away and we were not fed at all this morning we hear them outside now cracking eggs
with miss burns and missus lewis who were regarded as leaders in the hunger strike protest removed to the district jail mister whittaker and his staff at occoquan began a systematic attempt to break down the morale of the hunger strikers
each one was called to the mat and interrogated will you work will you put on prison clothes will you eat will you stop picketing will you go without paying your fine and promise never to picket again
how baffled he must have been the answer was definite and final their resistance was superb one of the few warning incidents during the gray days of our imprisonment
was the unexpected sympathy and understanding of one of the government doctors
i have seen women in russia undergo extreme suffering for their ideals but unless i had seen this with my own eyes
my sister hunger struck in russia where she was imprisoned for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of two of her friends indicted for a government offense she was fed after three days
you girls are on your ninth day of hunger strike and your condition is critical it is a great pity that such women should be subjected to this treatment i hope that you will carry your point
and force the hand of the government
to be allowed to see the president and ask for a special order to visit her daughter failing to secure this she went daily to mister tumultys office asking if he himself would not intercede for her
the stories of the inhuman treatment at occoquan were false and that she must not believe them finally missus young pleaded to be allowed to send additional warm clothing to her daughter whom she knew to be too lightly clad for the vigorous temperature of november
mister tumulty assured her that the women were properly clothed and refused to permit the clothing to be sent the subsequent stories of the women showed what agonies they had endured because they were inadequately clad from the dampness of the cells into which they were thrown
missus john winters brannan was among the women who endured the night of terror missus brannan is the daughter of charles a dana founder of the new york sun and that great american patriot of liberty who was a trusted associate and counselor
of abraham lincoln missus brannan life long suffragist is an aristocrat of intellect and feeling who has always allied herself with libertarian movements this was her second term of imprisonment
she wrote a comprehensive affidavit of her experience after narrating the events which led up to the attack she continues superintendent whittaker then shouted out in a loud tone of voice
seize these women take them off that one that one take her off the guards rushed forward and an almost indescribable scene of violent confusion ensued i saw one of the guards seize her lucy burns
by the arms twist or force them back of her
and put it on in order to prepare myself if attacked i was trembling at the time and was stunned with terror at the situation as it had developed and said to the superintendent i will give my name under protest and started to walk towards the desk whereon lay the books the superintendent shouted to me
i saw the guards seizing the different women of the party with the utmost violence the furniture being overturned and the room a scene of the utmost disturbance
i saw miss lincoln lying on the floor with every appearance of having just been thrown down by the two guards who were standing over her in a menacing attitude seeing the general disturbance
i gave up all idea of giving my name at the desk and instinctively joined my companions to go with them and share whatever was in store for them the whole group of women were thrown dragged or herded out of the office on to the porch down the steps to the ground and forced to cross the road
to the administration building during all of this time superintendent whittaker was directing the whole attack all of us were thrown into different cells in the mens prison i being put in one with four other women the cell containing a narrow bed
and one chair which was immediately removed during the time that we were being forced into the cells the guards kept up an uproar shouting banging the iron doors clanging bars making a terrifying noise
i and one of my companions were lying down on the narrow bed on which were a blanket and one pillow the door of the cell was opened and a mattress and a blanket being thrown in the door was violently banged to
and lay down covering themselves with the blanket i looked across the corridor and saw miss lincoln and asked her whether she was all right being anxious to know whether she had been hurt by the treatment in the office building instantly superintendent whittaker rushed forward shouting at me
gag you and put you in a straitjacket i wish to state again that the cells into which we were put were situated in the mens prison
and who could at any moment look at us furthermore the water closets were in full view of the corridor where superintendent whittaker and the guards were moving about the flushing of these closets could only be done from the corridor and we were forced to ask the guards to do this for us
the men who had shortly before attacked us
i was exhausted by what i had seen and been through and spent the night in absolute terror of further attack and of what might still be in store for us i thought of the young girls who were with us and feared for their safety the guards acted brutal in the extreme
incited to their brutal conduct towards us by the superintendent i thought of the offense with which we had been charged merely that of obstructing traffic and felt that the treatment that we had received was out of all proportion to the offense with which we were charged
and that the superintendent the matron and guards would not have dared to act towards us as they had acted unless they relied upon the support of higher authorities it seemed to me that everything had been done from the time we reached the workhouse to terrorize us and my fear
lest the extreme of outrage would be worked upon the young girls of our party became intense it is impossible for me to describe the terror of that night
the affidavit then continues with the story of how missus brannan was compelled the following morning to put on prison clothes was given a cup of skimmed milk and a slice of toast
and requested permission to lie down feeling so ill i could not sleep having a sense of constant danger i was almost paralyzed and in wretched physical condition
seven of us being in the party we were so exhausted and weary that we were obliged to stop constantly to rest on our way back from the walk we heard the baying of hounds very near us in the woods the matron said
one of the party miss findeisen asked whether they would attack us to which the matron replied that is just what they would do and hurried us along the baying grew louder and nearer at times and then more distant as the dogs rushed back and forth
and this went on until we reached the sewing room the effect of this upon our nerves can better be imagined than described every conceivable lie was tried in an effort to force the women to abandon their various form of resistance
they were told that no efforts were being made from the outside to reach them and that their attorney had been called off the case each one was told that she was the only one hunger striking each one was told that all the others had put on prison clothes and were working
although they were separated from one another they suspected the lies and remained strong in their resistance after mister obriens one visit and the subsequent reports in the press he was thereafter refused admission to the workhouse
it was evident that the administration was anxious to keep this group away from alice paul and her companions as they counted on handling the rebellion more easily in two groups than one meanwhile the condition of the prisoners in the workhouse grew steadily worse
we decided to take the only course open to obtain a writ of habeas corpus a hurried journey by counsel to united states district judge waddill of norfolk virginia brought the writ
it compelled the government to bring the prisoners into court and show cause why they should not be returned to the district jail this conservative southern judge said of the petition for the writ
there followed a week more melodramatic than the most stirring moving picture film although the writ had been applied for in the greatest secrecy
a detective suddenly appeared to accompany mister obrien from washington to norfolk during his stay in norfolk and back to washington telephone wires at our headquarters were tapped it was evident that the administration was cognizant of every move in this procedure before it was executed
no sooner was our plan decided upon than friends of the administration besought us to abandon the habeas corpus proceedings one member of the administration sent an emissary to our headquarters with the following appeal
if you will only drop these proceedings i can absolutely guarantee you that the prisoners will be removed from the workhouse to the jail in a week in a week they may be dead by that time we answered we cannot wait
and before the end of the week they hoped to increase their facilities for forcible feeding at the workhouse they also wished to conceal the treatment of the women the exposure of which would be inevitable in any court proceedings and lastly
the administration was anxious to avoid opening up the whole question of the legality of the very existence of the workhouse in virginia persons convicted in the district for acts committed in violation of district law were transported to virginia alien territory to serve their terms
it was a moot point whether prisoners were so treated with sufficient warrant in law eminent jurists held that the district had no right to convict a person under its laws and commit that person to confinement in another state they contended that sentence imposed upon a person for unlawful acts in the district
should be executed in the district hundreds of persons who had been convicted in the district of columbia and who had served their sentences in virginia had been without money or influence enough to contest this doubtful procedure in the courts the administration
was alarmed we quickened our pace a member of the administration rushed his attorney as courier to the women in the workhouse to implore them not to consent to the habeas corpus proceedings he was easily admitted and tried to extort from one prisoner at a time a promise to reject the plan
the women suspected his solicitude and refused to make any promise whatsoever without first being allowed to see their own attorney we began at once to serve the writ ordinarily this would be an easy thing to do but for us it developed into a very difficult task
a deputy marshal must serve the writ counsel sought a deputy for miles around washington not one was to be found at his home or lodgings none could be reached by telephone
where he kept himself discreetly hidden for several days when a deputy was found six attempts were made to serve the writ all failed finally by a ruse mister whittaker was caught at his home late at night
and so might marry again when he would
and to assist and support me as long as i lived and that if he died before me he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still in the name of a sister and he was in some respects careful of me when he heard of me
as you shall hear in its time i came away for england in the month of august after i had been eight years in that country and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me which perhaps few women have gone through the life of
we had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of england and where we arrived in two and thirty days but were then ruffled with two or three storms
got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again though we met with very bad weather again in which the ship sprung her mainmast as they called it for i knew not what they meant but we got at last into milford haven in wales
where though it was remote from our port
the isle of britain i resolved to venture it no more upon the waters which had been so terrible to me so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers i resolved to come for london
the port whither she was bound was to bristol where my brothers chief correspondent lived i got to london in about three weeks where i heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in bristol
the breaking of her mainmast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled i had now a new scene of life upon my hands and a dreadful appearance it had i was come away with a kind of final farewell
what i brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it i might have married again tolerably well but as it was i was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole and this without any hope of recruit
i was entirely without friends nay even so much as without acquaintance
that set me up formerly for a fortune she was dead and her husband also as i was informed upon sending a person unknown to inquire the looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to bristol and during my attendance upon that affair
i took the diversion of going to the bath for as i was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though i was a woman without a fortune
as had been my case before the bath is a place of gallantry enough expensive and full of snares i went thither indeed
but i must do myself justice as to protest i knew nothing amiss i meant nothing but in an honest way nor had i any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards i suffered them to be guided
as it is called there and contracted some unhappy acquaintances which rather prompted the follies i fell afterwards into than fortified me against them i lived pleasantly enough kept good company that is to say gay fine company
but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly and that as i had no settled income so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts
however i shook them off
but i was in the wrong place for it i was not now at redriff where if i had set myself tolerably up some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony but i was at the bath
where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way i had spent the first season well enough
for though i had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion
as it might be called i had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough i was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted
i contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house i lodged who though she did not keep an ill house as we call it yet had none of the best principles in herself i had on all occasions behaved myself so well
as not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever and all the men that i had conversed with were of so good reputation that i had not given the least reflection by conversing with them
for a wicked correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one gentleman as above who always singled me out for the diversion of my company as he called it which as he was pleased to say was very agreeable to him but at that time
there was no more in it i had many melancholy hours at the bath after the company was gone
and for recruits of money yet i chose to come back to bath for my residence because being on good terms with the woman in whose house i lodged in the summer i found that during the winter i lived rather cheaper there
here i say i passed the winter as heavily as i had passed the autumn cheerfully
of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia in good circumstances
and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss i had received
so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence and so indeed i did and as the ships went from bristol to york river in virginia and back again generally in less time from london
and that my brother corresponded chiefly at bristol i thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to london where also i had not the least acquaintance my new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition
and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all
till it was found necessary to do otherwise she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house and in particular the gentleman who as i said singled me out for his companion
the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house
letting him know that i was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same in a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation
if i might believe him was to him
and he had such an opinion of my virtue that as he often professed he believed if he should offer anything else i should reject him with contempt he soon understood from me that i was a widow that i had arrived at bristol from virginia by the last ships
and that i waited at bath till the next virginia fleet should arrive by which i expected considerable effects i understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct
of her own relations which he consented to to avoid any reflections that might as was not unusual in such cases be cast on him for mismanaging her cure and in the meantime he came to the bath to divert his thoughts
from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was my landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him
as a man of honour and of virtue as well as of great estate and indeed i had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when i was in bed
and i also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear
and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought i ought to expect some gratification from him for my company for indeed he did as it were engross me and i was seldom from him
i told her i had not given him the least occasion to think i wanted it
and she did so and managed it so dexterously
and so i put off all room for any offer for the present however it was not long before he attacked me again
which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since i
in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that i would promise him that when i was any way straitened or like to be so i would frankly tell him of it and that i would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer
adding that i should always find i had a true friend though perhaps i was afraid to trust him i omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness
and indeed from that time i did not appear so much reserved to him as i had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how free soever our conversation was i could not arrive to that sort of freedom
though i was secretly very glad of his offer some weeks passed after this and still i never asked him for money when my landlady a cunning creature who had often pressed me to it but found that i could not do it
makes a story of her own inventing and comes in
oh widow says she i have bad news to tell you this morning what is that said i are the virginia ships taken by the french for that was my fear no no says she
but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none now i could by no means like her project
which indeed he did not want and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask so i took her up short
said i for i assure you he brought me all the money i sent him for and here it is said i pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it and added i intend you shall have most of it by and by he seemed distasted a little at her talking
as she did at first as well as i taking it as i fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again the next morning we talked of it again when i found he was fully satisfied
and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it and that i had promised him otherwise i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landladys talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with
but i supposed she wanted what i owed her which was about eight guineas which i had resolved to give her and had accordingly
he was in a might good humour when he heard me say i had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time but the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and i answering he asked me to come into his chamber
for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment after some very kind expressions he asked me if i would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me
at the word sincere and asking him if i had ever given him any answers which were not sincere i promised him i would why then his request was he said to let him see my purse
i immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half
not by a great deal well then he said he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money i had every farthing i told him i would and i went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer
where i had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling he looked a little at it but did not tell it
and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnut tree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which i did in which drawer there was a great deal of money in gold i believe near two hundred guineas
but i knew not how much he took the drawer and taking my hand made me put it in and take a whole handful i was backward at that but he held my hand hard in his hand
when i had done so he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer
and carry it all home into my own chamber i relate this story the more particularly because of the good humour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed
and in a word pressed me to buy better
for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me or else i should not be able to pay him again he then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances
and that he thought i had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done after this he made me take a maid and keep house
which i did very willingly believing as it appeared that i should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too we had lived thus near three months when
the company beginning to wear away at the bath he talked of going away
i was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture i was to live in there or how he might use me but while this was in debate
called shepton where he had some business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not travel so he sent his man back to bath to beg me that i would hire a coach and come over to him before he went
he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them i did not know but i secured them as well as i could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where i found him very ill indeed however i persuaded him to be carried
in a litter to the bath where there was more help and better advice to be had he consented and i brought him to the bath which was about fifteen miles as i remember here he continued very ill of a fever
and kept his bed five weeks all which time i nursed him and tended him myself
indeed if i had been his wife i could not have done more i sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then i got a pallet bed into his room and lay in it just at his beds feet
i was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me and i used to sit and cry by him many hours together
however at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover as indeed he did though very slowly were it otherwise than what i am going to say i should not be backward to disclose it
as it is apparent i have done in other cases in this account but i affirm that through all this conversation abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when i or he was in bed and abating the necessary offices
of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us oh that it had been so to the last after some time he gathered strength and grew well apace
and i would have removed my pallet bed but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then i removed to my own chamber
and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his and now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me
but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own i told him i was fully satisfied of it he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me
as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher i believed him and told him i did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said
was a great while after this that i had occasion on my own business to go to bristol upon which he hired me a coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increased
to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it
and coming into that room said very frankly to him sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no
which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another
he decently went out of the room till i was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while at last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury
he starts out of his bed and now my dear says he you shall see how just i will be to you and that i can keep my word and away he comes to my bed i resisted a little but i must confess i should not have resisted him much
if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as i said i lay still and let him come to bed when he was there he took me in his arms and so i lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me
other than embracing me as i say in his arms no not the whole night but rose up and dressed him in the morning and left me as innocent for him as i was the day i was born this was a surprising thing to me
and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk person nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all but of mere affection insisting on it
that though i was to him to most agreeable woman in the world yet because he loved me he could not injure me
we will pass to the consideration of a regular out and out pirate one from whose mast head would have floated the black flag with its skull and cross bones if that emblematic piece of bunting had been in use by the pirates of the period
and his own was unknown and the brazilian because he was born in brazil though of dutch parents unlike most of his fellow practitioners he did not gradually become a pirate from his early youth
he never had an intention of being anything else as soon as he grew to be a man he became a bloody buccaneer and at the first opportunity he joined a pirate crew and had made but a few voyages when it was perceived by his companions
that he was destined to become a most remarkable sea robber he was offered the command of a ship with a well armed crew of marine savages
he fell in with a spanish ship loaded with silver bullion having captured this he sailed with his prize to jamaica which was one of the great resorts of the english buccaneers there his success delighted the community
his talents for the conduct of great piratical operations soon became apparent and he was generally acknowledged as the head pirate of the west indies he was now looked upon as a hero even by those colonists
who had no sympathy with pirates and as for esquemeling he simply worshipped the great brazilian desperado if he had been writing the life and times of alexander the great julius caesar or mister gladstone
he could not have been more enthusiastic in his praises and as in the arabian nights the roc is described as the greatest of birds so in the eyes of the buccaneer biographer this roc was the greatest of pirates
that roc now became famous the better he became known the more general was the fear and respect felt for him and we are told that the mothers of the islands used to put their children to sleep by threatening them with the terrible roc if they did not close their eyes
this story however i regard with a great deal of doubt
but i do not believe it is an easy thing to frighten a child into going to sleep if i found it necessary to make a youngster take a nap i should say nothing of the condition of affairs in cuba or of the persecutions of the armenians
this renowned pirate from brazil must have been a terrible fellow to look at he was strong and brawny his face was short and very wide with high cheek bones and his expression probably resembled that of a pug dog
his eyebrows were enormously large and bushy and from under them he glared at his mundane surroundings he was not a man whose spirit could be quelled by looking him steadfastly in the eye it was his custom in the daytime to walk about
carrying a drawn cutlass resting easily upon his arm edge up very much as a fine gentleman carries his high silk hat and any one who should impertinently stare or endeavor to quell his high spirits in any other way
would probably have felt the edge of that cutlass descending rapidly through his physical organism he was a man who insisted upon being obeyed and if any one of his crew behaved improperly or was even found idle
but although he was so strict and exacting during the business sessions of his piratical year by which i mean when he was cruising around after prizes he was very much more disagreeable when he was taking a vacation
on his return to jamaica after one of his expeditions it was his habit to give himself some relaxation after the hardships and dangers through which he had passed and on such occasions it was a great comfort to roc to get himself thoroughly drunk
with his cutlass waving high in the air he would rush out into the street and take a whack at every one whom he met as far as was possible the citizens allowed him to have the street to himself and it was not at all likely
that his visits to jamaica were looked forward to with any eager anticipations roc it may be said was not only a bloody pirate but a blooded one he was thoroughbred
from the time he had been able to assert his individuality he had been a pirate and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever reform himself into anything else there were no extenuating circumstances in his case
in his nature there was no alloy nor moderation nor forbearance the appreciative esquemeling who might be called the boswell of the buccaneers could never have met his hero roc
when that bushy bearded pirate was running amuck in the streets but if he had it is not probable that his book would have been written he assures us that when roc was not drunk he was esteemed but at the same time feared
but there are various ways of gaining esteem and rocs method certainly succeeded very well in the case of his literary associate as we have seen the hatred of the spaniards by the buccaneers began very early in the settlement of the west indies
but in all the instances of ferocious enmity toward the spaniards there has been nothing to equal the feelings of roc the brazilian upon that subject his dislike to everything spanish arose he declared
seems to have been that there was nothing too bad for a spaniard the object of his life was to wage bitter war against spanish ships and spanish settlements he seldom gave any quarter to his prisoners
then there was nothing for them to do but to go on board their vessels and put out to sea in search of some fresh prize so far rocs career had been very much like that of many other companions of the coast
differing from them only in respect to intensity and force but he was a clever man with ideas
he was cruising about campeachy without seeing any craft that was worth capturing
and find out whether or not there were any spanish vessels in the bay which were well laden and which were likely soon to come out so with a small boat filled with some of his trusty men he rowed quietly into the port to see what he could discover
and had sent that mild mannered observer into the harbor to investigate into the state of affairs
but he chose to go himself and he came to grief no sooner did the people on the ships lying in the harbor behold a boat approaching with a big browed broad jawed mariner sitting in the stern
and with a good many more broad backed hairy mariners than were necessary pulling at the oars than they gave the alarm
roc must have had a great deal of confidence in his own powers or perhaps he relied somewhat upon the fear which his very presence evoked but he made a mistake this time he had run into the lions jaw and the lion had closed his teeth upon him
when the pirate captain and his companions were brought before the governor he made no pretence of putting them to trial buccaneers were outlawed by the spanish
and were considered as wild beasts to be killed without mercy wherever caught consequently roc and his men were thrown into a dungeon and condemned to be executed if however the spanish governor had known what was good for himself
during the time that preparations were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates
this was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient if he could not get himself out of scrapes he could not expect to be successful in this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels
or jumping overboard with a couple of wine jars for a life preserver or of doing any of those ordinary things which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors
inside of a fortress and if they escaped from this they would find themselves unarmed in the midst of a body of spanish soldiers their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now
and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any roc had plenty of wit and he used it well there was a slave probably not a negro nor a native
who came in to bring him food and drink and by the means of this man the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the governor he promised the slave that if he would help him and he told him it would be very easy to do so
he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends and this of course was a great inducement to the poor fellow who may have been an englishman or a frenchman in good circumstances at home the slave agreed to the proposals
and the first thing he did was to bring some writing materials to roc who thereupon began the composition of a letter
when he was coming into the bay roc had noticed a large french vessel that was lying at some distance from the town
by the hand of roc went on to say that if any harm should come to these brave men who had been taken and imprisoned when they were doing no harm to anybody he would swear in his most solemn manner that never
for the rest of his life would he give quarter to any spaniard who might fall into his hands and he moreover threatened that any kind of vengeance which should become possible for the buccaneers and french united to inflict upon the spanish ships
or upon the town of campeachy should be taken as soon as possible after he should hear of any injury that might be inflicted upon the unfortunate men who were then lying imprisoned in the fortress when the slave came back to roc
the letter was given to him with very particular directions as to what he was to do with it he was to disguise himself as much as possible so that he should not be recognized by the people of the place and then in the night he was to make his way out of the town
and early in the morning he was to return as if he had been walking along the shore of the harbor when he was to state that he had been put on shore from the french vessel in the offing with a letter which he was to present to the governor the slave performed his part of the business very well
the next day wet and bedraggled from making his way through the weeds and mud of the coast he presented himself at the fortress with his letter and when he was allowed to take it to the governor no one suspected that he was a person employed about the place
having fulfilled his mission he departed and when seen again he was the same servant whose business it was to carry food to the prisoners the governor read the letter with a disquieted mind
he knew that the french ship which was lying outside the harbor was a powerful vessel and he did not like french ships anyway the town had once been taken and very badly treated by a little fleet of french and english buccaneers
and he was very anxious that nothing of the kind should happen again there was no great spanish force in the harbor at that time and he did not know how many buccaneering vessels might be able to gather together in the bay
if it should become known that the great pirate roc had been put to death in campeachy it was an unusual thing for a prisoner to have such powerful friends so near by and the governor took rocs case into most earnest consideration
and he determined to get rid of him as soon as possible he felt himself in the position of a man who has stolen a baby bear and who hears the roar of an approaching parent through the woods
to throw away the cub and walk off as though he had no idea there were any bears in that forest would be the inclination of a man so situated and to get rid of the great pirate without provoking the vengeance of his friends
was the natural inclination of the governor now roc and his men were treated well and having been brought before the governor were told that in consequence of their having committed no overt act of disorder they would be set at liberty and shipped to england
upon the single condition that they would abandon piracy and agree to become quiet citizens in whatever respectable vocation they might select to these terms roc and his men agreed without argument
they declared that they would retire from the buccaneering business and that nothing would suit them better than to return to the ways of civilization and virtue there was a ship about to depart for spain and on this the governor gave roc and his men free passage to the other side of the ocean
there is no doubt that our buccaneers would have much preferred to have been put on board the french vessel but as the spanish governor had started his prisoners on the road to reform he did not wish to throw them into the way of temptation
by allowing them to associate with such wicked companions as frenchmen and roc made no suggestion of the kind knowing very well how greatly astonished the french captain would be if the governor were to communicate with him on the subject
on the voyage to spain roc was on his good behavior and he was a man who knew how to behave very well when it was absolutely necessary no doubt there must have been many dull days on board ship
when he would have been delighted to gamble to get drunk and to run amuck up and down the deck but he carefully abstained from all these recreations and showed himself to be such an able bodied and willing sailor
that the captain allowed him to serve as one of the crew roc knew how to do a great many things not only could he murder and rob but he knew how to turn an honest penny when there was no other way of filling his purse he had learned among the indians
how to shoot fish with bow and arrows and on this voyage across the atlantic he occupied all his spare time in sitting in the rigging and shooting the fish which disported themselves about the vessel
these fish he sold to the officers and we are told that in this way he earned no less than five hundred crowns perhaps that many dollars if this account is true fish must have been very costly in those days
in every way roc behaved so well that for his sake all his men were treated kindly and allowed many privileges but when this party of reformed pirates reached spain and were allowed to go where they pleased
they thought no more of the oaths they had taken to abandon piracy than they thought of the oaths which they had been in the habit of throwing right and left
but as soon as they could manage it they sailed back to the west indies and eventually found themselves in jamaica
not only did roc cast from him every thought of reformation and a respectable life but he determined to begin the business of piracy on a grander scale than ever before he made a compact with an old french buccaneer
and with a large company of buccaneers he actually set out to take a town having lost everything he possessed and having passed such a long time without any employment more profitable than that of shooting fish with a bow and arrows
our doughty pirate now desired to make a grand strike and if he could take a town and pillage it of everything valuable it contained he would make a very good fortune in a very short time and might retire if he chose
from the active practice of his profession
in yucatan and although this was a bold and rash undertaking the two pirates were bold and rash enough for anything roc had been a prisoner in merida and on account of his knowledge of the town he believed that he and his followers could land upon the coast
if they could do this it would be an easy matter to rush upon the unsuspecting garrison and having annihilated these make themselves masters of the town but their plans did not work very well they were discovered by some indians
after they had landed who hurried to merida and gave notice of the approach of the buccaneers consequently when roc and his companions reached the town they found the garrison prepared for them cannons loaded and all the approaches guarded
still the pirates did not hesitate they advanced fiercely to the attack just as they were accustomed to do when they were boarding a spanish vessel but they soon found that fighting on land was very different from fighting at sea
in a marine combat it is seldom that a party of boarders is attacked in the rear by the enemy although on land such methods of warfare may always be expected
and they were therefore greatly dismayed when a party of horsemen from the town who had made a wide detour through the woods suddenly charged upon their rear
tributor and a great many of the pirates were killed or taken and roc the brazilian had a terrible fall this most memorable fall occurred in the estimation of john esquemeling
who knew all about the attack on merida and who wrote the account of it but he had never expected to be called upon to record that his great hero roc the brazilian saved his life after the utter defeat of himself and his companions
by ignominiously running away the loyal chronicler had as firm a belief in the absolute inability of his hero to fly from danger as was shown by the scottish douglas when he stood
come one come all the bushy browed pirate of the drawn cutlass
who would even surrender to say nothing of running away that esquemeling could scarcely believe that roc had retreated from his enemies deserted his friends and turned his back upon the principles which he had always so truculently proclaimed
but this downfall of a hero simply shows that esquemeling although he was a member of the piratical body and was proud to consider himself a buccaneer did not understand the true nature of a pirate under the brutality
the cruelty the dishonesty and the recklessness of the sea robbers of those days there was nearly always meanness and cowardice roc as we have said in the beginning of this sketch was a typical pirate
under certain circumstances he showed himself to have all those brave and savage qualities which esquemeling esteemed and revered and under other circumstances he showed those other qualities which esquemeling despised
but which are necessary to make up the true character of a pirate the historian john seems to have been very much cut up by the manner in which his favorite hero had rounded off his piratical career
and after that he entirely dropped roc from his chronicles
an old man in agony but still genial and full of delicate wit drapes the motley spectacle of his lifelike writings with the costly tapestry of a preface which in itself is a beautiful and romantic painting
but what shall my spirit bestow upon its offspring which like its parent is as poor in poesy as it is rich in love just one word a parting trope
it is not alone the royal eagle who may despise the croaking of the raven the swan too is proud and takes no note of it
human beings and what they want and do
a fresh warm breath of life and love fanned me rustling and stirring in all the branches of the verdant grove i gazed and enjoyed it all the rich green the white blossoms and the golden fruit
and in my minds eye i saw too in many forms my one and only beloved now as a little girl now as a young lady in the full bloom and energy of love and womanhood
and now as a dignified mother with her demure babe in her arms i breathed the spring and i saw clearly all about me everlasting youth smiling i said to myself
from this feeling or thought nothing could have turned me neither general despair nor personal fear for i believed
but i gladly lost myself in all those blendings and intertwinings of joy and pain from which spring the spice of life and the flower of feeling spiritual pleasure as well as sensual bliss
a subtle fire flowed through my veins
it was not only the wish to relieve the tormenting sting of my desire and to cool the sweet fire by gratification it was not for your lips that i longed or for your eyes or for your body
a marvelous mingling of memories and desires all the mysteries of caprice in man and woman seemed to hover about me when suddenly in my solitude
and yet with calm presence of mind i watched for the slightest sign of joy in you so that not one should escape me to impair the harmony i not only enjoyed but i felt and enjoyed
the enjoyment you are so extraordinarily clever dearest lucinda that you have doubtless long ere this begun to suspect that this is all nothing but a beautiful dream
not long ago i was standing by the window how long i do not know for along with the other rules of reason and morality i completely forgot about the lapse of time well i was standing by the window and looking out into the open
the morning certainly deserves to be called beautiful the air is still and quite warm and the verdure here before me is fresh and even as the wide land undulates in hills and dales
so the calm broad silvery river winds along in great bends and sweeps until it and the lovers fantasy cradled upon it like the swan pass away into the distance and lose themselves in the immeasurable
my vision doubtless owes the grove and its southern color effect to the huge mass of flowers here beside me
all the rest is readily explained by psychology
all except that not long ago i was standing by the window and doing nothing and that i am now sitting here and doing something something which is perhaps little more than nothing perhaps even less
i was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear and precise periods the exact and straightforward history of our frivolities and of my dulness i was going to expound to you step by step
in accordance with natural laws the misunderstandings that attack the hidden centre of the loveliest existence and to confess to you the manifold effects of my awkwardness
i was about to describe the apprenticeship of my manhood
a period which taken as a whole or in parts i can never look back upon without a great deal of inward amusement a little melancholy and considerable self satisfaction
still as a refined lover and writer i will endeavor to refashion the coarse occurrence and adapt it to my purpose for me and for this book however for my love of it and for its inner development
there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this namely that right at the start i begin by abolishing what we call orderly arrangement keep myself entirely aloof from it
frankly claiming and asserting the right to a charming confusion this is all the more necessary inasmuch as the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and to my pen is so incessantly progressive
and so inflexibly systematic if the form were also of that character this in its way unique letter would then acquire an intolerable unity and monotony
so i use my incontestable right to a confused style by inserting here in the wrong place one of the many incoherent sheets which i once filled with rubbish
it was written in a mood of impatient longing due to my not finding you where i most surely expected to find you in your room on our sofa in the haphazard words suggested by the pen you had lately been using
the selection is not difficult for since among the dreamy fancies which are here confided to you in permanent letters the recollection of this most beautiful world
is the most significant and has a certain sort of resemblance to what they call thought i choose in preference to anything else a dithyrambic fantasy on the most lovely of situations
for once we know to a certainty that we live in a most beautiful world the next need is obvious
it looks at me joyously out of its deep eyes and opens its arms to embrace my spirit
the holiest and most evanescent of those delicate traits and utterances of the soul which to one who does not know the highest seem like bliss itself
are merely the common atmosphere of our spiritual breath and life the words are weak and vague
furthermore in this throng of impressions i could only repeat anew the one inexhaustible feeling of our original harmony a great future beckons me on into the immeasurable
each idea develops a countless progeny
i remember everything even the griefs and all my thoughts that have been and are to be
the blood rushes wildly through my swollen veins my mouth thirsts for the contact of your lips and my fancy seeks vainly among the many forms of joy for one
which might at last gratify my desire and give it rest and then again i suddenly and sadly bethink me of the gloomy time when i was always waiting without hope
and madly loving without knowing it when my innermost being overflowed with a vague longing which it breathed forth but rarely in half suppressed sighs
oh i should have thought it all a fairy tale that there could be such joy such love as i now feel and such a woman who could be my most tender beloved my best companion and at the same time
a perfect friend for it was in friendship especially that i sought for what i wanted and for what i never hoped to find in any woman in you i found it all and more than i could wish for
you know nothing the womanliness of your soul aside from minor peculiarities consists in its regarding life and love as the same thing for you all feeling is infinite and eternal
you recognize no separations your being is an indivisible unity that is why you are so serious and so joyous why you regard everything in such a large and indifferent way
that is why you love me all of me and will surrender no part of me to the state to posterity or to manly pleasures i am all yours we are closest to each other
and we understand each other you accompany me through all the stages of manhood from the utmost wantonness to the most refined spirituality in you alone i first saw true pride
and true feminine humility the most extreme suffering if it is only surrounded without separating us
would seem to me nothing but a charming antithesis to the sublime frivolity of our marriage why should we not take the harshest whim of chance for an excellent jest and a most frolicsome caprice since we
like our love are immortal i can no longer say my love and your love they are both alike in their perfect mutuality marriage is the everlasting unity and alliance of our spirits
as that last glass of champagne we drank together when i said and so let us drink out the rest of our lives
and so i say again let us live and love i know you would not wish to survive me you would rather follow your dying husband into his coffin gladly and lovingly would you descend into the burning abyss
even as the women of india do impelled by a mad law the cruel constraining purpose of which desecrates and destroys the most delicate sanctities of the will
on the other side perhaps longing will be more completely realized i often wonder over it every thought and whatever else is fashioned within us
seems to be complete in itself as single and indivisible as a person one thing crowds out another and that which just now was near and present soon sinks back into obscurity
and then again come moments of sudden and universal clarity when several such spirits of the inner world completely fuse together into a wonderful wedlock and many a forgotten bit of our ego shines forth in a new light
and even illuminates the darkness of the future with its bright lustre as it is in a small way
i think in a large way that which we call a life is for the complete inner immortal man only a single idea an indivisible feeling
and for him there come too moments of the profoundest and fullest consciousness when all lives fall together and mingle and separate in a different way
the time is coming when we two shall behold in one spirit that we are blossoms of one plant or petals of one flower we shall then know with a smile
that what we now call merely hope was really memory do you know how the first seed of this idea germinated in my soul before you and took root in yours
weave our love ever and ever more closely and firmly together just as a child like an echo doubles the happiness of its gentle parents nothing can part us
and certainly any separation would only draw me more powerfully to you i bethink me how at our last embrace you vehemently resisting i burst into simultaneous tears and laughter
i tried to calm myself and in a sort of bewilderment i would not believe that i was separated from you until the surrounding objects convinced me of it against my will
but then my longing grew again irresistible until on its wings i sank back into your arms suppose words or a human being to create a misunderstanding between us
the poignant grief would be transient and quickly resolve itself into complete harmony how could separation separate us when presence itself is to us as it were too present
we have to cool and mitigate the consuming fire with jests and thus for us the most witty of the forms and situations of joy is also the most beautiful
it is not merely the delight of exhaustion or the anticipation of revenge i see in it a wonderful and profoundly significant allegory of the development of man and woman
into complete humanity that was my dithyrambic fantasy on the loveliest situation in the loveliest of worlds i know right well what you thought of it
and how you took it at that time and i think i know just as well what you will think of it and how you will take it here here in this little book in which you expect to find genuine history plain truth and calm reason
yes even morality the charming morality of love
how can a man wish to write anything which it is scarcely permissible to talk about which ought only to be felt
i replied
a man feels it he must wish to talk about it and what a man wishes to talk about he may write
i wanted first to demonstrate to you that there exists in the original and essential nature of man a certain awkward enthusiasm which likes to utter boldly that which is delicate and holy
and sometimes falls headlong over its own honest zeal and speaks a word that is divine to the point of coarseness this apology would indeed save me
but perhaps only at the enormous expense of my manhood itself for whatever you may think of my manhood in particular you have nevertheless a great deal against the sex in general
meantime i will by no means make common cause with them but will rather excuse and defend my liberty and audacity by means of the example of the little innocent wilhelmina
since she too is a lady whom i love most tenderly
the children are justified when they peep so curiously and timidly at a company of unknown faces each individual atom of everlasting time is capable of comprising a world of joy
and at the same time of opening up a fathomless abyss of pain and suffering
i understand now the old fairy tale about the man whom the sorcerer allowed to live a great many years in a few moments for i know by my own experience the terrible omnipotence of the fantasy
since the last letter from your sister it is three days now i have undergone the sufferings of an entire life from the bright sunlight of glowing youth to the pale moonlight of sagacious old age
every little detail she wrote about your sickness taken with what i had already gleaned from the doctor and had observed myself confirmed my suspicion that it was far more dangerous than you thought
indeed no longer dangerous but decided past hope lost in this thought and my strength entirely exhausted on account of the impossibility of hurrying to your side
my state of mind was really very disconsolate now for the first time i understand what it really was being new born by the joyful news that you are well again
i did not think of it as about to happen in the future or even in the present everything was already past for a long time you had been wrapt in the bosom of the cold earth
flowers had started to grow on the beloved grave and my tears had already begun to flow more gently mute and alone i stood and saw nothing but the features i had loved and the sweet glances of the expressive eyes
now and then the pale face smiled and seemed asleep just as it had looked the last time i saw it then of a sudden the different memories all became confused
with unbelievable rapidity the outlines changed reassumed their first form and transformed themselves again and again until the wild vision vanished
only your holy eyes remained in the empty space and hung there motionless even as the friendly stars shine eternally over our poverty
now a piercing pain from dark suns burned me with an insupportable glare now a beautiful radiance hovered about as if to entice me then i seemed to feel a fresh breath of morning air fan me
i held my head up and cried aloud
why should you torment yourself in a few minutes you can be with her
i was already hastening to you when suddenly a new thought held me back and i said to my spirit
unworthy man you cannot even endure the trifling dissonances of this ordinary life and yet you regard yourself as ready for and worthy of a higher life go away and do and suffer as your calling is
and then present yourself again when your orders have been executed
is it not to you also remarkable how everything on this earth moves toward the centre how orderly everything is how insignificant and trivial so it has always seemed to me
and for that reason i suspect if i am not mistaken i have already imparted my suspicion to you that the next life will be larger and in the good as well as in the bad stronger wilder bolder and more tremendous
as when a person suddenly finds himself alone in the midst of immeasurable mountains of ice everything about me and in me was cold and strange and even my tears froze
wonderful worlds appeared and vanished before me in my uneasy dream i was sick and suffered great pain but i loved my sickness and welcomed the suffering
i hated everything earthly and was glad to see it all punished and destroyed i felt so alone and so strangely
and as a delicate spirit often grows melancholy in the very lap of happiness over its own joy and at the very acme of its existence becomes conscious of the futility of it all
so did i regard my suffering with mysterious pleasure i regarded it as the symbol of life in general i believed that i was seeing and feeling the everlasting discord
and the lovely forms of refined culture seemed dead and trivial to me in comparison with this monstrous world of infinite strength and of unending struggle and warfare
even into the most hidden depths of existence on account of this remarkable feeling sickness acquired the character of a peculiar world complete in itself
i felt that its mysterious life was richer and deeper than the vulgar health of the dreaming sleep walkers all around me and with the sickliness which was not at all unpleasant
this feeling also clung to me and completely separated me from other men just as i was sundered from the earth by the thought that your nature and my love had been too sacred
it seemed to me that all was right so and that your unavoidable death was nothing more than a gentle awakening after a light sleep i too thought that i was awake when i saw your picture
which evermore transfigured itself into a cheerful diffused purity serious and yet charming quite you and yet no longer you the divine form irradiated by a wonderful light
now it was like the terrible gleam of visible omnipotence now like a soft ray of golden childhood
because every earthly sentiment was entirely strange to me and the feeling never left me that i was consecrated to death
the years passed slowly by and deeds and works advanced laboriously to their goal one after the other a goal that seemed as little mine as the deeds and works seemed to be what they are called
to me they were merely holy symbols and everything brought me back to my one beloved
and the one eternal and indivisible humanity all existence was an uninterrupted divine service of solitary love
finally i became conscious that it was now nearly over the brow was no longer smooth and the locks were becoming gray my career was ended but not completed
the best strength of life was gone and still art and virtue
stood ever unattainable before me i should have despaired had i not perceived and idolized both in you gracious madonna and you and your gentle godliness in myself
then you appeared to me beckoning with the summons of death
an earnest longing for you and for freedom seized me i yearned for my dear old fatherland and was about to shake off the dust of travel when i was suddenly called back to life by the promise and reassurance of your recovery
and only in that way does a human being become one and a complete entity that is by regarding and poetically conceiving himself as the centre of everything and the spirit of the world
but why poetically conceive since we find the germ of everything in ourselves and yet remain forever only a fragment of ourselves
the adventure of the cart it befell in the month of may queen guenever called to her knights of the table round and gave them warning that early upon the morrow she would ride a maying into the woods and fields beside westminster
and i warn you that there be none of you but he be well horsed and that ye all be clothed in green either silk or cloth and i shall bring with me ten ladies and every knight shall have a lady behind him
and every knight shall have a squire and two yeoman and all well horsed for thus it chanced one morn when all the court green suited but with plumes that mockd the may had been their wont a maying
so they made them ready and these were the names of the knights sir kay the seneschal sir agrivaine sir brandiles sir sagramour le desirus
sir dodynas le sauvage sir ozanna sir ladynas sir persant of inde sir ironside and sir pelleas and these ten knights made them ready
so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen and rode a maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them in great joy and delight now there was a knight
son to king brademagus who loved queen guenever passing well and so had he done long and many years now this knight sir maleagans learned the queens purpose and that she had no men of arms with her
but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying so he prepared him twenty men of arms and a hundred archers to take captive the queen and her knights
in the merry month of may in a morn at break of day with a troop of damsels playing the queen forsooth went forth a maying old song so when the queen had mayed
traitor knight said queen guenever what wilt thou do wilt thou shame thyself bethink thee how thou art a kings son and a knight of the table round and how thou art about to dishonor all knighthood and thyself
be it as it may said sir maleagans know you well madam i have loved you many a year and never till now could i get you to such advantage as i do now and therefore i will take you as i find you
then the ten knights of the round table drew their swords and the other party run at them with their spears
then they lashed together with swords till several were smitten to the earth so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully oppressed and needs must be slain at the last then for pity and sorrow she cried sir maleagans
slay not my noble knights and i will go with you upon this covenant that
madame said maleagans for your sake they shall be led with you into my own castle if that ye will be ruled and ride with me then sir maleagans charged them all that none should depart from the queen
for he dreaded lest sir launcelot should have knowledge of what had been done then the queen privily called unto her a page of her chamber that was swiftly horsed to whom she said go thou when thou seest thy time
and bear this ring unto sir launcelot and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me and spare not thy horse said the queen neither for water nor for land
and lightly he took his horse with the spurs and departed as fast as he might and when sir maleagans saw him so flee he understood that it was by the queens commandment for to warn sir launcelot
then they that were best horsed chased him and shot at him but the child went from them all then sir maleagans said to the queen madam ye are about to betray me but i shall arrange for sir launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you
then he rode with her and them all to his castle in all the haste that they might and by the way sir maleagans laid in ambush the best archers that he had to wait for sir launcelot
and the child came to westminster and found sir launcelot and told his message and delivered him the queens ring alas said sir launcelot
unless i may rescue that noble lady then eagerly he asked his armor and put it on him and mounted his horse and rode as fast as he might
and men say he took the water at westminster bridge and made his horse swim over thames unto lambeth then within a while he came to a wood where was a narrow way and there the archers were laid in ambush
and they shot at him and smote his horse so that he fell then sir launcelot left his horse and went on foot but there lay so many ditches and hedges betwixt the archers and him that he might not meddle with them
alas for shame said sir launcelot that ever one knight should betray another but it is an old saw a good man is never in danger but when he is in danger of a coward
then sir launcelot went awhile and he was exceedingly cumbered by his armor his shield and his spear and all that belonged to him then by chance there came by him a cart that came thither to fetch wood
carts were little used except for carrying offal and for conveying criminals to execution but sir launcelot took no thought of anything but the necessity of haste for the purpose of rescuing the queen so he demanded of the carter
that he should take him in and convey him as speedily as possible for a liberal reward the carter consented and sir launcelot placed himself in the cart and only lamented that with much jolting he made but little progress
he drew near to see who it might be then sir launcelot told him how the queen had been carried off and how in hastening to her rescue his horse had been disabled and he had been compelled to avail himself of the cart rather than give up his enterprise
then sir gawain said surely it is unworthy of a knight to travel in such sort but sir launcelot heeded him not at nightfall
but to admit his companion whom she supposed to be a criminal or at least a prisoner it pleased her not
at supper sir launcelot came near being consigned to the kitchen
neither would the damsels prepare a bed for him he seized the first he found unoccupied and was left undisturbed next morning he saw from the turrets of the castle a train accompanying a lady whom he imagined to be the queen
the lady of the castle supplied sir launcelot with a horse and they traversed the plain at full speed they learned from some travellers whom they met that there were two roads which led to the castle of sir maleagans here therefore the friends separated
sir launcelot found his way beset with obstacles which he encountered successfully but not without much loss of time as evening approached he was met by a young and sportive damsel who gayly proposed to him a supper
at her castle the knight who was hungry and weary accepted the offer though with no very good grace he followed the lady to her castle and ate voraciously of her supper but was quite impenetrable to all her amorous advances
suddenly the scene changed and he was assailed by six furious ruffians whom he dealt with so vigorously that most of them were speedily disabled when again there was a change and he found himself alone with his fair hostess
which she told him would by its changes of color disclose to him all enchantments and enable him to subdue them sir launcelot pursued his journey without being much incommoded except by the taunts of travellers
who all seemed to have learned by some means his disgraceful drive in the cart one more insolent than the rest had the audacity to interrupt him during dinner and even to risk a battle in support of his pleasantry launcelot
after an easy victory only doomed him to be carted in his turn at night he was received at another castle with great apparent hospitality but found himself in the morning in a dungeon and loaded with chains
consulting his ring and finding that this was an enchantment he burst his chains seized his armor in spite of the visionary monsters who attempted to defend it broke open the gates of the tower and continued his journey
at length his progress was checked by a wide and rapid torrent which could only be passed on a narrow bridge on which a false step would prove his destruction launcelot leading his horse by the bridle and making him swim by his side
passed over the bridge and was attacked as soon as he reached the bank by a lion and a leopard both of which he slew and then exhausted and bleeding seated himself on the grass and endeavored to bind up his wounds
offered him his assistance and informed him that the queen was safe in his castle but could only be rescued by encountering maleagans launcelot demanded the battle for the next day and accordingly it took place at the foot of the tower
and under the eyes of the fair captive launcelot was enfeebled by his wounds and fought not with his usual spirit and the contest for a time was doubtful
ah launcelot my knight truly have i been told that thou art no longer worthy of me these words instantly revived the drooping knight he resumed at once his usual superiority and soon laid at his feet his haughty adversary
moved by the entreaties of brademagus ordered him to withhold the blow and he obeyed the castle and its prisoners were now at his disposal launcelot hastened to the apartment of the queen threw himself at her feet
and was about to kiss her hand when she exclaimed ah launcelot why do i see thee again yet feel thee to be no longer worthy of me after having been disgracefully drawn about the country in a she had not time to finish the phrase
for her lover suddenly started from her and bitterly lamenting that he had incurred the displeasure of his sovereign lady rushed out of the castle threw his sword and his shield to the right and left ran furiously into the woods and disappeared
it seems that the story of the abominable cart which haunted launcelot at every step had reached the ears of sir kay who had told it to the queen as a proof that her knight must have been dishonored
three days elapsed during which launcelot wandered without knowing where he went till at last he began to reflect that his mistress had doubtless been deceived by misrepresentation
and that it was his duty to set her right he therefore returned compelled maleagans to release his prisoners
had the satisfaction of meeting him the next day
where he was brought up in total ignorance of arms and chivalry he was allowed no weapon
which was the only thing of all her lordes faire gere that his mother carried to the wood with her in the use of this he became so skilful that he could kill with it
not only the animals of the chase for the table but even birds on the wing at length however perceval was roused to a desire of military renown by seeing in the forest five knights who were in complete armor
he said to his mother mother what are those yonder they are angels my son said she by my faith i will go and become an angel with them and perceval went to the road and met them
tell me good lad said one of them sawest thou a knight pass this way either today or yesterday
such an one as i am said the knight if thou wilt tell me what i ask thee i will tell thee what thou askest me gladly will i do so said sir owain for that was the knights name
and perceval in return gave him such information as he had then perceval returned to his mother and said to her mother those were not angels but honorable knights then his mother swooned away
and perceval went to the place where they kept the horses that carried firewood and provisions for the castle and he took a bony piebald horse which seemed to him the strongest of them and he pressed a pack into the form of a saddle
and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses when he came again to his mother the countess had recovered from her swoon my son said she desirest thou to ride forth
yes with thy leave said he go forward then she said to the court of arthur where there are the best and the noblest and the most bountiful of men and tell him thou art perceval the son of pelenore
and ask of him to bestow knighthood on thee and whenever thou seest a church repeat there thy pater noster
for thus shalt thou acquire fame yet freely give it to another for thus thou shalt obtain praise if thou see a fair woman pay court to her for thus thou wilt obtain love
perceiving in one corner of the tent some food two flasks full of wine and some boars flesh roasted he said my mother told me whenever i saw meat and drink to take it
and he ate greedily for he was very hungry the maiden said sir thou hadst best go quickly from here for fear that my friends should come and evil should befall you but perceval said
and he gave the maiden his own ring in exchange for hers then he mounted his horse and rode away perceval journeyed on till he arrived at arthurs court and it so happened
for when her page was serving the queen with a golden goblet this knight struck the arm of the page and dashed the wine in the queens face and over her stomacher then he said
let him follow me to the meadow so the knight took his horse and rode to the meadow carrying away the golden goblet and all the household hung down their heads and no one offered to follow the knight to take vengeance upon him
for it seemed to them that no one would have ventured on so daring an outrage unless he possessed such powers through magic or charms that none could be able to punish him just then behold
perceval entered the hall upon the bony piebald horse with his uncouth trappings in the centre of the hall stood kay the seneschal tell me tall man said perceval is that arthur yonder
what wouldst thou with arthur asked kay my mother told me to go to arthur and receive knighthood from him by my faith said he thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with arms
then all the household began to jeer and laugh at him but there was a certain damsel who had been a whole year at arthurs court
and the kings fool footnote a fool was a common appendage of the courts of those days when this romance was written a fool was the ornament held in next estimation to a dwarf he wore a white dress with a yellow bonnet
and carried a bell or bawble in his hand though called a fool his words were often weighed and remembered as if there were a sort of oracular meaning in them
till she had seen him who would be the flower of chivalry now this damsel came up to perceval and told him smiling that if he lived he would be one of the bravest and best of knights truly said kay
thou art ill taught to remain a year at arthurs court with choice of society and smile on no one and now before the face of arthur and all his knights to call such a man as this the flower of knighthood
that she fell senseless to the ground then said kay to perceval go after the knight who went hence to the meadow overthrow him and recover the golden goblet and possess thyself of his horse and arms and thou shalt have knighthood
i will do so tall man said perceval so he turned his horses head toward the meadow and when he came there the knight was riding up and down proud of his strength and valor and noble mien tell me said the knight
didst thou see any one coming after me from the court
and to take from thee the goblet and thy horse and armor for myself silence said the knight go back to the court and tell arthur either to come himself
and unless he do so quickly i will not wait for him by my faith said perceval choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly for i will have the horse and the arms and the goblet
upon this the knight ran at him furiously and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear
my mothers servants were not used to play with me in this wise so thus will i play with thee and he threw at him one of his sharp pointed sticks and it struck him in the eye and came out at the back of his head so that he fell down lifeless
verily said sir owain the son of urien to kay the seneschal thou wast ill advised to send that madman after the knight for he must either be overthrown or flee and either way it will be a disgrace to arthur and his warriors
therefore will i go to see what has befallen him so sir owain went to the meadow and he found perceval trying in vain to get the dead knights armor off in order to clothe himself with it
sir owain unfastened the armor and helped perceval to put it on and taught him how to put his foot in the stirrup and use the spur
and urged on his horse with a stick then owain would have had him return to the court to receive the praise that was his due but perceval said i will not come to the court till i have encountered the tall man that is there
to revenge the injury he did to the maiden but take thou the goblet to queen guenever and tell king arthur that wherever i am i will be his vassal and will do him what profit and service i can and sir owain
went back to the court and related all these things to arthur and guenever and to all the household
and he came to a lake on the side of which was a fair castle and on the border of the lake he saw a hoary headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion and his attendants were fishing in the lake
when the hoary headed man beheld perceval approaching he arose and went into the castle perceval rode to the castle and the door was open and he entered the hall
and the hoary headed man received perceval courteously and asked him to sit by him on the cushion when it was time the tables were set and they went to meat and when they had finished their meat the hoary headed man asked perceval
if he knew how to fight with the sword i know not said perceval but were i to be taught doubtless i should and the hoary headed man said to him i am thy uncle thy mothers brother i am called king pecheur
footnote the word means both fisher and sinner thou shalt remain with me a space in order to learn the manners and customs of different countries and courtesy and noble bearing and this do thou remember
if thou seest aught to cause thy wonder ask not the meaning of it if no one has the courtesy to inform thee the reproach will not fall upon thee but upon me that am thy teacher
while perceval and his uncle discoursed together perceval beheld two youths enter the hall bearing a golden cup and a spear of mighty size with blood dropping from its point to the ground
and when all the company saw this they began to weep and lament but for all that the man did not break off his discourse with perceval and as he did not tell him the meaning of what he saw he forebore to ask him concerning it
now the cup that perceval saw was the sangreal and the spear the sacred spear and afterwards king pecheur removed with those sacred relics into a far country one evening
perceval entered a valley and came to a hermits cell and the hermit welcomed him gladly and there he spent the night and in the morning he arose and when he went forth behold a shower of snow had fallen in the night and a hawk
had killed a wild fowl in front of the cell and the noise of the horse had scared the hawk away and a raven alighted on the bird and perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the snow
to the hair of the lady that best he loved which was blacker than jet and to her skin which was whiter than the snow and to the two red spots upon her cheeks which were redder than the blood upon the snow
now arthur and his household were in search of perceval and by chance they came that way know ye said arthur who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder lord said one of them
i will go and learn who he is
and who he was but perceval was so intent upon his thought that he gave him no answer then the youth thrust at perceval with his lance and perceval turned upon him and struck him to the ground
and when the youth returned to the king and told how rudely he had been treated sir kay said i will go myself and when he greeted perceval and got no answer he spoke to him rudely and angrily
and perceval thrust at him with his lance and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade and while he lay thus stunned his horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace then said
surnamed the golden tongued because he was the most courteous knight in arthurs court it is not fitting that any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought unadvisedly for either he is pondering some damage that he has sustained
or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves if it seem well to thee lord i will go and see if this knight has changed from his thought and if he has i will ask him courteously to come and visit thee
and perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear pondering the same thought
if i thought it would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me i would converse with thee i have also a message from arthur unto thee to pray thee to come and visit him
and two men have been before on this errand that is true said perceval and uncourteously they came they attacked me and i was annoyed thereat then he told him the thought that occupied his mind
and gawain said this was not an ungentle thought and i should marvel if it were pleasant for thee to be drawn from it then said perceval tell me is sir kay in arthurs court
and truly he is the knight who fought with thee last verily said perceval i am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the smiling maiden then perceval told him his name and said
who art thou and he replied
i am right glad to meet thee said perceval for i have everywhere heard of thy prowess and uprightness and i solicit thy fellowship thou shalt have it by my faith and grant me thine said he
gladly will i do so answered perceval so they went together to arthur and saluted him
him whom thou hast sought so long welcome unto thee chieftain said arthur and hereupon there came the queen and her handmaidens and perceval saluted them and they were rejoiced to see him and bade him welcome
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
says the apostle paul i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart
my kinsmen according to the flesh brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved and such dear reader is in greater or less degree the feeling of every renewed heart
loving jesus it would fain have others love him too it desires the salvation of all but for that of its own dear ones it longs and labors and prays it is like jacob wrestling with the angel when he said
i will not let thee go except thou bless me and thus it was with elsie she knew now that her father was not a christian that he had no real love for jesus none of the true fear of god before his eyes
she saw that if he permitted her to read to him from gods word as he sometimes did it was not that he felt any pleasure in listening but only to please her she had no reason to suppose he ever prayed and though he went regularly to church
it was because he considered it proper and respectable to do so and not that he cared to worship god or to learn his will this conviction which had gradually dawned upon elsie until now it amounted to certainty caused her great grief
she shed many tears over it in secret and very many and very earnest were the prayers she offered up for her dear fathers conversion she was sitting on his knee one evening in the drawing room while he and several other gentlemen were conversing on the subject of religion
they were discussing the question whether or no a change of heart were necessary to salvation the general opinion seemed to be that it was not and elsie listened with pain while her father expressed his decided conviction that all who led an honest upright moral life
and attended to the outward observances of religion were quite safe he could see no necessity for a change of heart he did not believe in the doctrine of total depravity not he no indeed he thought the world much better than many people would have us believe
elsie fixed her eyes on his face with a very mournful gaze while he was speaking but he was busy with his argument and did not notice her but one of the guests was just expressing his approval of mister dinsmores sentiments when catching sight of elsies face
he stopped remarking your little girl looks as if she had something to say on the subject what is it my dear elsie blushed hesitated and looked at her father yes speak my daughter if you have anything to say he said encouragingly elsie lifted
marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again she repeated these words of inspiration with a deep earnest solemnity that seemed to impress every hearer for a moment there was a deep hush in the room then the gentleman asked
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me where did you learn all this he asked looking at her with mingled surprise and admiration in the bible sir she modestly replied you seem to have read it to some purpose said he
and now since you consider that change so necessary can you tell me how it is to be brought about gods holy spirit alone can change a sinners heart sir and how am i to secure his aid he asked elsie answered with a text
she replied the sweet little face all suffused with blushes and the soft downcast eyes filling with tears why do you think so he asked again
i think there is a text that says you must be able always to give a reason for the hope that is in you or something to that effect is there not yes sir be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you
with meekness and fear then raising her eyes to his face with a touching mixture of deep humility and holy boldness she continued and this sir is my answer jesus says him that cometh unto me i will in no wise cast out
and i believe him i did go to him and he did not cast me out but forgave my sins and taught me to love him and desire to serve him all my life this conversation between the gentleman and the little girl had drawn the attention of all present
and now missus dinsmore who had more than once shown signs of impatience said well elsie i think you have now talked quite enough for a child of your age then pulling out her watch it is high time for little folks to be in bed elsie
blushing deeply would have retired immediately but her father held her fast saying as he gave his stepmother an angry glance you need not go elsie unless you choose i am quite capable of judging when it is time to send you to bed
whispered elsie who had a great dread of missus dinsmores anger very well then you may do as you like he replied giving her a good night kiss and with a graceful good night to the company the little girl left the room
her questioner followed her with an admiring glance then turning to her father exclaimed warmly she is a remarkably intelligent child dinsmore one that any father might be proud of i was astonished at her answers
yes remarked travilla a text has been running in my head ever since you commenced your conversation something about these things being hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes and he added
and her fathers voice said good morning little daughter
she asked raising her head to give him a smile of joyful welcome i did not know you were there ah i have been watching you for several minutes he said always poring over the same book elsie do you never tire of it no indeed papa
it is always new and i do love it so it is so very sweet may i read a little to you she added coaxingly yes i love to listen to anything read by my darling he said sitting down and taking her on his knee
laid her head on his breast asking dear papa dont you believe the bible certainly daughter i am not an infidel he replied in a careless tone well then papa she continued half hesitatingly
i was much pleased with your intelligent answers to mister lee last evening elsie sighed and her eyes filled with tears it was not what she wanted what an odd child you are he said laughing
she dropped her head on his breast and burst into tears and sobs why elsie my own darling what ails you he asked in great surprise
the young party at roselands had now grown so large several additions having been made to it on monday afternoon and evening that a separate table was ordered to be spread for them in the nursery where they took their meals together
missus brown the housekeeper taking the head of the table for the double purpose of keeping them in order and seeing that their wants were well supplied elsie came in to breakfast from a brisk walk with her papa looking fresh and rosy and bright as the morning
quite different from some of the little guests who had been up far beyond their usual hours the night before and having just left their beds had come down pale and languid in looks and in some instances showing peevish and fretful tempers
very trying to the patience of their attendants o elsie exclaimed carry howard
we were all so sorry that you had to leave us so soon last night we had lots of fun after you left i think your papa might have let you stay up a little longer but he has promised that tonight as we are to have the christmas tree and ever so much will be going on
late hours and rich food are very bad for little folks and i notice that miss elsie has grown a deal stronger and healthier looking since her papa came home he takes such good care of her indeed he does said elsie heartily thanking missus brown with one of her sweetest smiles
whatever you all prefer said elsie if you like i will practice that duet with you the first hour after breakfast or do anything else you wish but the second hour i must spend with papa and after that i have nothing to do but entertain my company all day
do you do lessons in holidays asked mary leslie a merry fun loving child about elsies own age who considered lessons an intolerable bore and had some vague idea that they must have been invented for the sole purpose of tormenting children
her blue eyes opened wide with astonishment when elsie quietly replied that her papa had kindly arranged to give her an hour every morning
than spending the whole day in play elsie did keenly enjoy that quiet hour spent in studying and reciting to her father sitting on a low stool at his feet or perhaps oftener on his knee with his arm around her waist
loving also his little pupil with all a fathers fond yearning affection delighted in his task when elsie left her father she found that the carringtons had just arrived
she and lucy had not seen each other since the week the latter had spent at roselands early in the summer and both felt pleased to meet missus carrington gave elsie a warm embrace remarking that she had grown and was looking extremely well better than she had ever seen her
but no one was more delighted to meet elsie than herbert and she was very glad to learn that his health was gradually improving he was not however at all strong even yet and his mother thought it best for him to lie down and rest a little after his ride
a variety of story books toys and games had been provided for their amusement elsies entrance was hailed with delight for she was a general favorite oh elsie cant you tell us what to play cried mary leslie im so tired
and she yawned wearily here are some dissected maps mary replied elsie opening a drawer would you not like them no indeed thank you they are too much like lessons
will you play jack stones here are some smooth pebbles yes if you and carry and lucy will play with me agreed said the others lets have a game so elsie having first set the little ones to building block houses
supplied harry carrington an older brother of lucys with a book and two younger boys with dissected maps to arrange the four girls sat down in a circle on the carpet and began their game for a few moments all went on smoothly
who was sobbing and wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron enna took my blocks sobbed the child
you know flora is a visitor and we must be very polite to her no i wont returned enna flatly shes got enough now no i havent i cant build a house with those flora said with another sob
elsie stood a moment looking much perplexed then with a brightening face exclaimed in her cheerful pleasant way well never mind flora dear i will get you my doll
the little weeper answered eagerly smiling through her tears elsie ran out of the room and was back again almost in a moment with the doll in her arms there dear little flora she said laying it gently on the childs lap
please be careful of it for i have had it a long while and prize it very much because my guardian gave it to me when i was a very little girl and he is dead now i wont break it elsie indeed i wont replied flora confidently
and elsie sat down to her game again a few moments afterward mister horace dinsmore passed through the room elsie he said as he caught sight of his little daughter go up to my dressing room there was evidently displeasure and reproof in his tone
mister dinsmore passed out of one door while elsie left by the other the three little girls looked inquiringly into each others faces what is the matter what has elsie done asked carry in a whisper i dont know
nothing i guess replied lucy indignantly i do believe hes just the crossest man alive when i was here last summer he was all the time scolding and punishing poor elsie for just nothing at all i think he must be very strict said carry
and that was the conclusion they all came to in the meantime elsie sat down alone in her banishment and tried to think what she could have done to deserve it it was some time before she could form any idea of its cause
but at length it suddenly came to her recollection that once several months before this her father had found her sitting on the carpet and had bade her get up immediately and sit on a chair or stool saying never let me see you sitting on the floor elsie
when there are plenty of seats at hand i consider it a very unladylike and slovenly trick she covered her face with her hands and sat thus for some moments feeling very sorry for her forgetfulness and disobedience very penitent on account of it
and then kneeling down she asked forgiveness of god a full hour she had been there alone and the time had seemed very long when at last the door opened and her father came in elsie rose and came forward to meet him
with the air of one who had offended and knew she was in disgrace but putting one of her little hands in his she looked up pleadingly into his face asking in a slightly tremulous tone dear papa are you angry with me
i am always displeased when you disobey me elsie he replied very gravely laying his other hand on her head i am very sorry i was naughty papa she said humbly and casting down her eyes
no sir i did not mean it so and i am very very sorry dear papa please forgive me and i will try never to forget again i think you disobeyed in another matter he said
but i think i will remember not to do it again
she held up her face for a kiss which he gave i wish i could always be good papa she said but i am naughty so often no said he i think you have been a very good girl for quite a long time
and elsie found the children in the nursery engaged in eating flora turned to her as she entered please elsie dont be cross she said coaxingly i am real sorry your dolls broken but it wasnt my fault enna would try to snatch it
and that made it fall and break its head poor elsie this was quite a trial and she could scarcely keep back the tears as following floras glance she saw her valued doll lying on the window seat
with its head broken entirely off she said not a word but hastily crossing the room took it up and gazed mournfully at it kind missus brown who had just finished helping her young charge all round
followed her to the window never mind dear she said in her pleasant cheery tone patting elsies cheek and smoothing her hair ive got some excellent glue and i think i can stick it on again and make it almost as good as ever
no indeed he is not mary and he lets me eat everything that he thinks is good for me elsie answered with some warmth she was seated between caroline howard and lucy carrington what did your papa send you away for elsie whispered the latter
quite unusual with her while the hot tears came into her eyes for she knew very well what was lucys opinion of her father and more than half suspected that she had been making some unkind remark about him to the others
and she was eager to remove any unfavorable impression they might have received i am sure he must love you very dearly elsie remarked caroline soothingly no one could help seeing that just by the way he looks at you elsie answered her with a pleased and grateful look
whom she did not remember ever to have seen before but who insisted on seating the little girl on the sofa by her side and keeping her there a long while loading her with caresses and flattery my dear child she said what lovely hair you have
so fine and soft and glossy such a beautiful color too
natural ringlets im sure are they not yes maam elsie answered simply wishing from the bottom of her heart that the lady would release her and talk to some one else but the lady had no such intention you are a
very sweet little girl i am sure and i shall love you dearly she said kissing her several times ah i would give anything if i had such a clear fair complexion and such rosy cheeks that makes you blush well i like to see it
blushes are very becoming oh you neednt pretend you dont know youre handsome youre a perfect little beauty do tell me where did you get such splendid eyes but i neednt ask for i have only to look at your father to see where they came from
mister dinsmore to elsies papa who just then came toward them you ought to be very proud of this child she is the very image of yourself and a perfect little beauty too
miss stevens is pleased to flatter me he said bowing low but flattery is not good for either grown up children or younger ones and i must beg leave to decline the compliment
as i cannot see that elsie bears the slightest resemblance to me or any of my family she is very like her mother though he added with a half sigh and a tender loving glance at his little girl and that is just what i would have her
it is such a lovely day but how soon do you start as soon as the ladies can be ready the horses will be at the door in a very few moments
rising and sailing out of the room mister dinsmore took the seat she had vacated and passing his arm round his little girl said to her in an undertone my little daughter must not be so foolish as to believe that people mean all they say to her
for some persons talk in a very thoughtless way and without perhaps intending to be exactly untruthful say a great deal that they really do not mean and i should be sorry indeed to see my little girl so spoiled by all this silly flattery
as to grow up conceited and vain she looked at him with her own sweet innocent smile free from the slightest touch of vanity no papa she said i do not mind when people say such things because i know the bible says
favor is deceitful and beauty is vain and in another place he that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet so i will try to keep away from that lady shall i not papa whenever you can do so without rudeness daughter
and he moved away thinking to himself how strangely the teachings of that book seem to preserve my child from every evil influence a sigh escaped him there was lurking within his breast a vague consciousness that her father needed such a safeguard
but had it not lucy who was standing at the window turned quickly round come girls she said let us run out and see them off theyre bringing up the horses
how pretty she looks and theres that miss stevens coming out now hateful thing i cant bear her come elsie and carry and she ran out caroline and elsie following
elsie however went no further than the hall where she stood still at the foot of the stairs come elsie called the other two from the portico come out here no replied the little girl i cannot come without something round me
no lucy i must obey my father elsie answered in a very pleasant but no less decided tone some one caught her round the waist and lifted her up oh papa she exclaimed i did not know you were there
and set her down the little girls watched until the last of the party had disappeared down the avenue and then ran gayly up stairs to elsies room where they busied themselves until tea time in various little preparations for the evening
who passed in and out with an air of mystery and importance and generally laden with some odd looking bundle when going in which they invariably left behind on coming out again and many a whispered consultation had been held as to what was probably going on in there
elsie and carry seemed to be in the secret but only smiled and shook their heads wisely when questioned but at length tea being over and all both old and young assembled as if by common consent in the drawing room it began to be whispered about
that their curiosity was now on the point of being gratified
and every face brightened with mirth and expectation and when a moment after the doors were thrown open there was a universal burst of applause a large christmas tree had been set up at the further end of the room
and with its myriad of lighted tapers and its load of toys and bonbons interspersed with many a richer and more costly gift made quite a display beautiful
missus dinsmore and adelaide approached the tree and began the pleasant task of distributing the gifts everything was labelled and each as his or her name was called out stepped forward to receive the present no one had been forgotten each had something
and almost every one had several pretty presents mary leslie and little flora arnott were made perfectly happy with wax dolls that could open and shut their eyes caroline howard received a gold chain from her mamma and a pretty pin from elsie
because mary leslies doll was a little larger than hers elsie had already received a pretty bracelet from her aunt adelaide a needle case from lora and several little gifts from her young guests
and was just beginning to wonder what had become of her papas promised present when she heard her name again and adelaide turning to her with a pleased look slipped a most beautiful diamond ring on her finger from your papa she said
go and thank him it is well worth it elsie sought him out where he stood alone in a corner an amused spectator of the merry scene see papa she said holding up her hand i think it very beautiful
thank you dear papa thank you very much does it please you my darling he asked stooping to press a kiss on the little upturned face so bright and happy yes papa
the very prettiest ring i ever saw yet i think there is something else you would have liked better is there not he asked looking searchingly into her face dear papa i like it very much i would rather have it than anything else on the tree
still you have not answered my question he said with a smile as he sat down and drew her to his side adding in a playful tone come i am not going to put up with any evasion tell me truly if you would have preferred something else
and if so what it is elsie blushed and looked down then raising her eyes and seeing with what a tender loving glance he was regarding her she took courage to say yes papa there is one thing i would have liked better
and that is your miniature to her surprise he looked highly pleased at her reply and giving her another kiss said well darling some day you shall have it
mister horace dinsmore called adelaide taking some small glittering object from the tree another present for me he asked as walter came running with it he had already received several from his father and sisters
do you like it papa she asked her face glowing with delight to see how pleased he was yes darling very much and i shall always think of my little girl when i use it keep it in your pocket and use it every day wont you papa
and he laughed and stroked her hair
not to night to morrow after breakfast you may eat the cream candy and the rock but none of the others they are colored and very unwholesome wont you eat some papa she asked with winning sweetness no dearest he said
for though i too am fond of sweet things i will not eat them while i refuse them to you do papa she urged it would give me pleasure to see you enjoying it no darling i will wait until to morrow too
then please keep it for me until to morrow papa will you yes he said
and then as the gifts had all been distributed and the little folks were in high glee a variety of sports were commenced by them in which some of their elders also took a part and thus the hours sped away so rapidly
that elsie was very much surprised when her father called her to go to bed is it half past nine already papa she asked
as i gazed upon them i wondered to what secret place within their brooding immensities the little metal mysteries had fled and to what myriads it might be of their kind
of what powers small like these or or quick on the screen of my mind flashed two pictures side by side
the little four rayed print in the great dust of the crumbling ruin and its colossal twin on the breast of the poppied valley i turned aside crept through the shattered portal and looked over the haunted hollow unbelieving i rubbed my eyes
then leaped to the very brim of the bowl a lark had risen from the roof of one of the shattered heaps and had flown caroling up into the shadowy sky a flock of the little willow warblers flung themselves across the valley scolding and gossiping
a hare sat upright in the middle of the ancient roadway the valley itself lay serenely under the ambering light smiling peaceful emptied of horror
i dropped over the side walked cautiously down the road up which but an hour or so before we had struggled so desperately paced farther and farther with an increasing confidence and a growing wonder
gone was that soul of loneliness vanished the whirlpool of despair that had striven to drag us down to death the bowl was nothing but a quiet smiling lovely little hollow in the hills i looked back
even the ruins had lost their sinister shape were time worn crumbling piles nothing more
a rifle shot rang out above us another and another from the portal scampered chiu ming his robe tucked up about his knees they come he gasped they come
down it was pouring an avalanche of men i caught the glint of helmets and corselets those in the van were mounted galloping two abreast upon sure footed mountain ponies their short swords lifted high flickered
after the horsemen swarmed foot soldiers a forest of shining points and dully gleaming pikes above them clearly to us came their battlecries again ventnors rifle cracked one of the foremost riders went down another stumbled over him fell
the rush was checked for an instant milling upon the road dick i cried rush ruth over to the tunnel mouth well follow we can hold them there ill get martin chiu ming after the pony quick i pushed the two over the rim of the hollow
quick mart i shouted up the shattered stairway we can get through the hollow ruth and drake are on their way to the break we came through hurry all right just a minute he called i heard him empty his magazine with almost machine gun quickness
all my ammunition is on him chiu mings taking care of that i gasped we darted out of the gateway a good five hundred yards away were ruth and drake running straight to the green tunnels mouth between them and us was chiu ming urging on the pony
as we sped after him i looked back the horsemen had recovered were now a scant half mile from where the road swept past the fortress i saw that with their swords the horsemen bore great bows a little cloud of arrows sparkled from them
fell far short dont look back grunted ventnor stretch yourself walter theres a surprise coming hope to god i judged the time right we turned off the ruined way
he reached out touched me youre right walter he grinned it does seem like carrying coals to newcastle
scattered prone among these were men and horses others staggered screaming on the farther side of this stony dike our pursuers were held like rushing waters behind a sudden fallen tree timed to a second cried ventnor hold em for a while
and holding ruth by the hand race back toward us even as he turned the vine screened entrance through which we had come through which we had thought lay safety streamed other armored men we were outflanked to the fissure shouted ventnor
drake heard for he changed his course to the crevice at whose mouth ruth had said the little things had lain after him streaked chiu ming urging on the pony shouting out of the tunnel down over the lip of the bowl leaped the soldiers
we dropped upon our knees sent shot after shot into them they fell back hesitated we sprang up sped on all too short was the check but once more we held them and again now ruth and dick were a scant fifty yards from the crevice i saw him stop
push her from him toward it she shook her head now chiu ming was with them ruth sprang to the pony lifted from its back a rifle then into the mass of their pursuers drake and she poured a fusillade they huddled wavered broke for cover
a chance gasped ventnor behind us was a wolflike yelping the first pack had re formed had crossed the barricade the dynamite had made was rushing upon us i ran as i had never known i could
over us whined the bullets from the covering guns close were we now to the mouth of the fissure if we could but reach it close close were our pursuers too the arrows closer no use said ventnor
natures summoning of every reserve to meet that peril my eyes took them in with photographic nicety the linked mail lacquered blue and scarlet of the horsemen brown padded armor of the footmen
their bows and javelins and short bronze swords their pikes and shields and under their round helmets their cruel bearded faces white as our own where the black beards did not cover them their fierce and mocking eyes
in this world of ours twenty centuries beyond their time swiftly accurately even as i scanned them we had been drilling into them they advanced deliberately heedless of their fallen their arrows had ceased to fly
i wondered why for now we were well within their range
weve saved ruth anyway he said drake ought to be able to hold that hole in the wall hes got lots of ammunition on the pony but theyve got us another wild shouting down swept the pack
we leaped to our feet sent our last bullets into them stood ready rifles clubbed to meet the rush i heard ruth scream what was the matter with the armored men why had they halted
what was it at which they were glaring over our heads and why had the rifle fire of ruth and drake ceased so abruptly simultaneously we turned within the black background of the fissure stood a shape an apparition
a woman beautiful awesome incredible she was tall standing there swathed from chin to feet in clinging veils of pale amber she seemed taller even than tall drake
yet it was not her height that sent through me the thrill of awe of half incredulous terror which relaxing my grip let my smoking rifle drop to earth nor was it that about her proud head a cloud of shining tresses swirled and pennoned
like a misty banner of woven copper flames no nor that through her veils her body gleamed faint radiance it was her eyes her great wide eyes whose clear depths were like pools of living star fires
they shone from her white face not phosphorescent not merely lucent and light reflecting but as though they themselves were sources of the cold white flames of far stars and as calm as those stars themselves
and in that face although as yet i could distinguish nothing but the eyes i sensed something unearthly god whispered ventnor what is she
the woman stepped from the crevice not fifty feet from her were ruth and drake and chiu ming their rigid attitudes revealing the same shock of awe that had momentarily paralyzed me she looked at them beckoned them
i saw the two walk toward her chiu ming hang back the great eyes fell upon ventnor and myself she raised a hand motioned us to approach i turned there stood the host that had poured down the mountain road
horsemen spearsmen pikemen a full thousand of them at my right were the scattered company that had come from the tunnel entrance threescore or more there seemed a spell upon them
they stood in silence like automatons only their fiercely staring eyes showing that they were alive quick breathed ventnor we ran toward her who had checked death even while its jaws were closing upon us
before we had gone half way as though our flight had broken whatever bonds had bound them a clamor arose from the host a wild shouting a clanging of swords on shields i shot a glance behind they were in motion advancing slowly
hesitatingly as yet but i knew that soon that hesitation would pass that they would sweep down upon us engulf us to the crevice i shouted to drake he paid no heed to me nor did ruth
their gaze fastened upon the swathed woman ventnors hand shot out gripped my shoulder halted me she had thrown up her head
from the lifted throat came a low a vibrant cry harmonious weirdly disquieting golden and sweet and laden with the eery minor wailings of the blue valleys night the dragoned chamber
before the cry had ceased there poured with incredible swiftness out of the crevice score upon score of the metal things the fissures vomited them
globes and cubes and pyramids not small like those of the ruins but shapes all of four feet high dully lustrous and deep within that luster the myriads of tiny points of light like unwinking staring eyes
they swirled eddied and formed a barricade between us and the armored men down upon them poured a shower of arrows from the soldiers i heard the shouts of their captains they rushed they had courage those men yes again came the womans cry
up from them thrust a thick rectangular column
eight feet in width and twenty feet high it shaped itself out from its left side from right side sprang arms fearful arms that grew and grew as globe and cube and angle raced up the columns side and clicked into place each upon each after the other
with magical quickness the arms lengthened before us stood a monstrous shape a geometric prodigy
a shining angled pillar that though rigid immobile seemed to crouch be instinct with living force striving to be unleashed two great globes surmounted it
flexing themselves in grotesque imitation of a boxer
again in gigantic awful parody of the spiked gloves of those ancient gladiators who fought for imperial nero
preening testing itself like an athlete
under the darkening sky in the green of the hollow the armored hosts frozen before it and then it struck out flashed two of the arms with a glancing motion with appalling force
they sliced into the close packed forward ranks of the armored men cut out of them two great gaps sickened i saw fragments of man and horse fly another arm javelined from its place like a flying snake clicked at the end of another
became a hundred foot chain which swirled like a flail through the huddling mass down upon a knot of the soldiers with a straight forward blow drove a third arm driving through them like a giant punch
all that host which had driven us from the ruins threw down sword spear and pike fled shrieking the horsemen spurred their mounts riding heedless over the footmen who fled with them the smiting thing seemed to watch them go
with amusement before they could cover a hundred yards it had disintegrated i heard the little wailing sounds then behind the fleeing men close behind them rose the angled pillar into place sprang the flexing arms and again it took its toll of them
they scattered running singly by twos in little groups for the sides of the valley they were like rats scampering in panic over the bottom of a great green bowl and like a monstrous cat the shape played with them yes played
it melted once more took new form where had been pillar and flailing arms was now a tripod thirty feet high its legs alternate globe and cube and upon its apex a wide and spinning ring of sparkling spheres
out from the middle of this ring stretched a tentacle writhing undulating like a serpent of steel four score yards at least in length
with the three long prongs of this trident the thing struck swiftly
it was i think that last touch of sheer horror the playfulness of the smiting thing that sent my dry tongue to the roof of my terror parched mouth and held open with monstrous fascination eyes that struggled to close
ever the armored men fled from it and ever was it swifter than they teetering at their heels on its tripod legs from half its length the darting snake streamed red rain i heard a sigh from ruth
wrested my gaze from the hollow turned she lay fainting in drakes arms beside the two the swathed woman stood looking out upon that slaughter calm and still shrouded with an unearthly tranquillity
viewing it it came to me with eyes impersonal cold indifferent as the untroubled stars which look down upon hurricane and earthquake in this world of ours there was a rushing of many feet at our left a wail from chiu ming
were they maddened by fear driven by despair determined to slay before they themselves were slain i do not know but those who still lived of the men from the tunnel mouth were charging us they clustered close their shields held before them
they had no bows these men they moved swiftly down upon us in silence swords and pikes gleaming the smiting thing rocked toward us the metal tentacle straining out like a rigid racing serpent flying to cut between its weird mistress and those who menaced her
i heard chiu ming scream saw him throw up his hands cover his eyes run straight upon the pikes chiu ming i shouted chiu ming this way i ran toward him
i saw a spear thrown it struck the chinaman squarely in the breast he tottered fell upon his knees even as he dropped the giant flail swept down upon the soldiers it swept through them like a scythe through ripe grain
it threw them broken and torn far toward the valleys sloping sides it left only fragments that bore no semblance to men ventnor was at chiu mings head i dropped beside him there was a crimson froth upon his lips
i thought that shin je was about to slay us he whispered fear blinded me his head dropped his body quivered lay still we arose looked about us dazedly
at the side of the crevice stood the woman her gaze resting upon drake his arms about ruth her head hidden on his breast the valley was empty save for the huddled heaps that dotted it
high up on the mountain path a score of figures crept all that were left of those who but a little before had streamed down to take us captive or to slay
high up in the darkening heavens the lammergeiers the winged scavengers of the himalayas were gathering the woman lifted her hand beckoned us once more slowly we walked toward her stood before her
chapter twenty seven the drums of destiny slowly we descended that mount of desolation lingeringly as though the brooding eyes of norhala were not yet sated with destruction
of human life of green life of life of any kind there was none
palace temple and home norhala had stamped flat she had crushed them within the rock even as she had promised the tremendous tragedy had absorbed my every faculty
now in the painful surges of awakening realization of full human understanding of that inhuman annihilation i turned to them for strength faintly i wondered again at ruths scantiness of garb her more than half nudity
dwelt curiously upon the red brand across ventnors forehead
but in the eyes of ruth was none of this sternly coldly triumphant indifferent to its piteousness as norhala herself she scanned the waste that less than an hour since had been a place of living beauty i felt a shock of repulsion after all
yet mother and blossoming maid youth and oldster all the pageant of humanity within the great walls were now but lines within the stone according to their different lights it came to me there had been
from norhala of course i looked for no perception of any of this but from ruth my reaction grew
there was dried blood on the edges a double ring of swollen white flesh rimming the cincture it was the mark of torture martin i cried that ring what did they do to you they waked me with that he answered quietly
i suppose i ought to be grateful although their intentions were not exactly therapeutic they tortured him ruths voice was tense bitter she spoke in persian for norhalas benefit i thought then not guessing a deeper reason
they tortured him they gave him agony until he returned and they promised him other agonies that would make him pray long for death and me me she raised little clenched hands
me they stripped like a slave they led me through the city and the people mocked me
before my eyes they tortured my brother norhala they were evil all evil norhala you did well to slay them she caught the womans hands pressed close to her
norhala gazed at her from great gray eyes in which the wrath was dying into which the old tranquillity the old serenity was flowing and when she spoke the golden voice held more than returning echoes of the far away faint chimings it is done she said
and it was well done sister now you and i shall dwell together in peace sister or if there be those in the world from which you came that you would have slain
then you and i shall go forth with our companies and stamp them out even as i did these my heart stopped beating for from the depths of ruths eyes shining shadows were rising wraiths answering norhalas calling
and as they rose steadily they drew life from the clear radiance summoning drew closer to the semblance of that tranquil spirit which her vengeance had banished
and at last it was twin sister of norhala who looked upon her from the face of ruth the white arms of the woman encircled her the glorious head bent over her flaming tresses mingled with tender brown curls
sister she whispered little sister these men you shall have as long as it pleases you to do with as you will or if it is your wish they shall go back to their world and i will guard them to its gates
but you and i little sister will dwell together in the vastnesses in the peace shall it not be so with no faltering with no glance toward us three
lover brother old friend ruth crept closer to her rested her head upon the virginal royal breasts it shall be so she murmured sister it shall be so norhala i am tired norhala i have seen enough of men
an ecstasy of tenderness a flame of unearthly rapture trembled over the womans wondrous face hungrily defiantly she pressed the girl to her the stars in the lucid heavens of her eyes were soft and gentle and caressing
ruth cried drake and sprang toward them she paid no heed and even as he leaped he was caught whirled back against us wait said ventnor
there was a curious understanding in his voice a curious sympathy too in the patient untroubled gaze that dwelt upon his sister and this weirdly exquisite woman who held her wait exclaimed drake wait hell the damned witch is stealing her away from us
again he threw himself forward recoiled as though swept back by an invisible arm fell against us and was clasped and held by ventnor and as he struggled the thing we rode halted
like metal waves back into it rushed the enigmatic billows that had washed over the fragments of the city we were lifted between us and the woman and girl a cleft appeared it widened into a rift
it was as though norhala had decreed it as a symbol of this her second victory or had set it between us as a barrier wider grew the rift
save for the bridge of our voices it separated us from ruth as though she stood upon another world higher we rose the three of us now upon the flat top of a tower upon whose counterpart fifty feet away
quietly it glided to the chasm it had blasted in the cliff wall the shadow of those walls fell upon us as one we looked back as one we searched out the patch of blue with the black blot at its breast we found it then the precipices hid it
silently we streamed through the chasm through the canyon and the tunnel speaking no word drakes eyes fixed with bitter hatred upon norhala ventnor brooding upon her always with that enigmatic sympathy we passed between the walls of the further cleft
stood for an instant at the brink of the green forest there came to us as though from immeasurable distances a faint sustained thrumming like the beating of countless muffled drums the thing that carried us trembled the sound died away
the thing quieted it began its steady effortless striding through the crowding trees but now with none of that speed with which it had come spurred forward by norhalas awakened hate ventnor stirred
purged not only by suffering but by it came to me some strange knowledge no use drake he said dreamily
but this i do know only one way or another can the balance fall and if it be one way then you and we shall have ruth back and if it falls the other way then there will be little need for us to care for man will be done martin what do you mean
it is the crisis he answered we can do nothing goodwin nothing whatever is to be steps forth now from the womb of destiny again there came that distant rolling louder now again the thing trembled
is it taps for them the drumming died as i listened fearfully about us was only the swishing the sighing of the falling trees beneath the tread of the thing motionless stood norhala
and as motionless ruth martin i cried once more a dreadful doubt upon me martin what do you mean whence did they come his voice was clear and calm the eyes beneath
these creatures that when many still are one that when one still are many whence did they come what are they he looked down upon the cubes that held us their hosts of tiny eyes shone up at him enigmatically
as though they heard and understood i do not forget he said at least not all do i forget of what i saw during that time when i seemed an atom outside space
as i told you or think i told you speaking with unthinkable effort through lips that seemed eternities away from me the atom who strove to open them
revelations i know not what to call them and though each seemed equally real of two of them only one i think can be true and of the third that may some time be true but surely is not yet through the air came a louder drum roll
in it something ominous something sinister it swelled to a crescendo abruptly ceased and now i saw norhala raise her head listen i saw a world a vast world goodwin marching stately through space
it was no globe it was a world of many facets of smooth and polished planes
a geometric thought of the great cause of god if you will made material it was airless waterless sunless
permission to accept such additional employment should it offer having formed an article of the terms on which he had engaged me it was therefore arranged in the course of next day
when evening came i prepared to step over in order to seek a conference with mademoiselle herself on the subject i had not had time to pay the visit before having been all day closely occupied in class
i remember very well that before quitting my chamber i held a brief debate with myself as to whether i should change my ordinary attire for something smarter at last i concluded it would be a waste of labour doubtless thought i
she is some stiff old maid for though the daughter of madame reuter she may well number upwards of forty winters besides if it were otherwise if she be both young and pretty i am not handsome
and no dressing can make me so therefore ill go as i am and off i started cursorily glancing sideways as i passed the toilet table surmounted by a looking glass a thin irregular face i saw
with sunk dark eyes under a large square forehead complexion destitute of bloom or attraction something young but not youthful no object to win a ladys love no butt for the shafts of cupid
in a moment i had pulled the bell in another moment the door was opened and within appeared a passage paved alternately with black and white marble the walls were painted in imitation of marble also and at the far end opened a glass door
through which i saw shrubs and a grass plat looking pleasant in the sunshine of the mild spring evening for it was now the middle of april this then was my first glimpse of the garden but i had not time to look long
the portress after having answered in the affirmative my question as to whether her mistress was at home opened the folding doors of a room to the left and having ushered me in closed them behind me i found myself in a salon
with a very well painted highly varnished floor chairs and sofas covered with white draperies a green porcelain stove walls hung with pictures in gilt frames a gilt pendule and other ornaments on the mantelpiece
a large lustre pendent from the centre of the ceiling mirrors consoles muslin curtains and a handsome centre table completed the inventory of furniture all looked extremely clean and glittering
but the general effect would have been somewhat chilling had not a second large pair of folding doors standing wide open and disclosing another and smaller salon more snugly furnished offered some relief to the eye
this room was carpeted and therein was a piano a couch a chiffonniere
which being undrawn afforded another glimpse of the garden through the large clear panes round which some leaves of ivy some tendrils of vine were trained
for i am not easily embarrassed i commenced the conversation by remarking on the pleasant aspect of her little cabinet
yes she said she often thought so and added
but you see i could not take my garden with me and i should scarcely find one so large and pleasant anywhere else in town i approved her judgment but you have not seen it yet said she rising
come to the window and take a better view i followed her she opened the sash and leaning out i saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been to me an unknown region it was a long
not very broad strip of cultured ground with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit trees down the middle there was a sort of lawn a parterre of rose trees some flower borders and on the far side
it looked pleasant to me very pleasant so long a time had elapsed since i had seen a garden of any sort
when i had taken a view of her well trimmed beds and budding shrubberies i allowed my glance to come back to herself nor did i hastily withdraw it
who might indeed be older than i but was still young she could not i thought be more than six or seven and twenty she was as fair as a fair englishwoman she had no cap her hair was nut brown and she wore it in curls
pretty her features were not nor very soft nor very regular but neither were they in any degree plain and i already saw cause to deem them expressive what was their predominant cast
was it sagacity sense yes i thought so but i could scarcely as yet be sure i discovered however
she said she was not absolutely certain of the wisdom of the step she was about to take because i was so young and parents might possibly object to a professor like me for their daughters but it is often well to act on ones own judgment said she
and to lead parents rather than be led by them the fitness of a professor is not a matter of age and from what i have heard and from what i observe myself
who is a married man of near fifty i remarked that i hoped she would find me worthy of her good opinion that if i knew myself i was incapable of betraying any confidence reposed in me du reste said she
the surveillance will be strictly attended to and then she proceeded to discuss the subject of terms she was very cautious quite on her guard she did not absolutely bargain but she warily sounded me to find out what my expectations might be
and when she could not get me to name a sum she reasoned and reasoned with a fluent yet quiet circumlocution of speech and at last nailed me down to five hundred francs per annum not too much but i agreed
before the negotiation was completed it began to grow a little dusk i did not hasten it for i liked well enough to sit and hear her talk i was amused with the sort of business talent she displayed edward could not have shown himself more practical
though he might have evinced more coarseness and urgency and then she had so many reasons so many explanations and after all she succeeded in proving herself quite disinterested and even liberal at last she concluded she could say no more
because as i acquiesced in all things there was no further ground for the exercise of her parts of speech i was obliged to rise i would rather have sat a little longer what had i to return to but my small empty room
especially now when the twilight softened her features a little and in the doubtful dusk i could fancy her forehead as open as it was really elevated her mouth touched with turns of sweetness as well as defined in lines of sense
when i rose to go i held out my hand on purpose though i knew it was contrary to the etiquette of foreign habits she smiled and said ah
and with the sort of tranquillity obvious in all she did a tranquillity which soothed and suited me singularly at least i thought so that evening brussels seemed a very pleasant place to me when i got out again into the street
and it appeared as if some cheerful eventful upward tending career were even then opening to me on that selfsame mild still april night
and her deep eyes fixed on the smoke in the valley below her breath was still coming fast between her parted lips there were tiny drops along the roots of her shining hair for the climb had been steep
as on the white mists trailing up the steeps below her beyond them was a gap in the next mountain chain and down in the little valley just visible through it were trailing blue mists as well and she knew
that they were smoke where was the great glare of yellow light that the circuit rider had told about and the leaping tongues of fire where was the shrieking monster that ran without horses like the wind
and tossed back rolling black plumes all streaked with fire for many days now she had heard stories of the furriners who had come into those hills and were doing strange things down there and so at last
she had climbed up through the dewy morning from the cove on the other side to see the wonders for herself she had never been up there before she had no business there now and if she were found out when she got back
she would get a scolding and maybe something worse from her step mother and all that trouble and risk for nothing but smoke so she lay back and rested her little mouth tightening fiercely
it was a big world though that was spread before her and a vague awe of it seized her straightway and held her motionless and dreaming beyond those white mists trailing up the hills
beyond the blue smoke drifting in the valley those limitless blue waves must run under the sun on and on to the end of the world her dead sister had gone into that far silence
and had brought back wonderful stories of that outer world and she began to wonder more than ever before whether she would ever go into it and see for herself what was there with the thought she rose slowly to her feet
moved slowly to the cliff that dropped sheer ten feet aside from the trail and stood there like a great scarlet flower in still air there was the way at her feet
that path that coiled under the cliff and ran down loop by loop through majestic oak and poplar and masses of rhododendron she drew a long breath and stirred uneasily
shed better go home now but the path had a snake like charm for her and still she stood following it as far down as she could with her eyes down it went
writhing this way and that to a spur that had been swept bare by forest fires along this spur it travelled straight for a while and as her eyes eagerly followed it to where it sank sharply into a covert of maples
the little creature dropped of a sudden to the ground and like something wild lay flat a human figure had filled the leafy mouth that swallowed up the trail and it was coming towards her
with a thumping heart she pushed slowly forward through the brush until her face fox like with cunning and screened by a blueberry bush hung just over the edge of the cliff and there she lay
like a crouched panther cub looking down for a moment all that was human seemed gone from her eyes but as she watched all that was lost came back to them
and something more she had seen that it was a man but she had dropped so quickly that she did not see the big black horse
now both man and horse had stopped the stranger had taken off his gray slouched hat and he was wiping his face with something white something blue was tied loosely about his throat
she had never seen a man like that before his face was smooth and looked different as did his throat and his hands his breeches were tight
which was deep in seat high both in front and behind and had strange long hooded stirrups starting to mount the man stopped with one foot in the stirrup and raised his eyes towards her so suddenly that she shrank back again
in her wonder over him she almost forgot herself forgot to wonder where he was going and why he was coming into those lonely hills until as his horse turned a bend of the trail
she saw hanging from the other side of the saddle something that looked like a gun he was a raider that man so cautiously and swiftly then she pushed herself back from the edge of the cliff
sprang to her feet dashed past the big tree and winged with fear sped down the mountain leaving in a spot of sunlight at the base of the pine
the ferns drenched his stirrups as he brushed through them and each dripping tree top broke the sunlight and let it drop in tent like beams through the shimmering undermist a bird flashed here and there through the green gloom
but there was no sound in the air but the footfalls of his horse and the easy creaking of leather under him the drip of dew overhead and the running of water below now and then he could see the same slender foot prints in the rich loam
and he saw them in the sand where the first tiny brook tinkled across the path from a gloomy ravine there the little creature had taken a flying leap across it and beyond he could see the prints no more he little guessed that while he halted to let his horse drink
he turned back up the creek and passed so close to where she had slipped aside into the bushes that she came near shrieking but his eyes were fixed on a pool of the creek above and to her wonder he strolled straight into the water with his boots on
pushing the net in front of him he was a raider sure she thought now and he was looking for a moonshine still and the wild little thing in the bushes smiled cunningly there was no still up that creek
and as he had left his horse below and his gun she waited for him to come back which he did by and by dripping and soaked to his knees then she saw him untie the queer gun on his saddle pull it out of a case and
her eyes got big with wonder take it to pieces and make it into a long limber rod in a moment he had cast a minnow into the pool and waded out into the water up to his hips she had never seen so queer a fishing pole so queer a fisherman
how could he get a fish out with that little switch she thought contemptuously by and by something hummed queerly the man gave a slight jerk and a shining fish flopped two feet into the air it was surely very queer
but stood still winding something with one hand and again the fish would flash into the air and then that humming would start again while the fisherman would stand quiet and waiting for a while and then he would begin to wind again in her wonder
drowning him stepping backward at the same time and a moment later the fish slid easily out of the edge of the water gasping along the edge of a low sand bank and the fisherman reaching down with one hand caught him in the gills then
he looked up and smiled and she had seen no smile like that before howdye little girl one bare toe went burrowing suddenly into the sand one finger went to her red mouth and that was all
and he smiled again cat got your tongue her eyes fell at the ancient banter but she lifted them straightway and stared again you live around here she stared on
where no answer whats your name little girl and still she stared
the steady eyes leaped angrily but there was still no answer and he bent to take the fish off his hook put on a fresh minnow turned his back and tossed it into the pool hit haint he looked up again
his line rang suddenly jack she cried you got a bite he pulled missed the strike and wound in the minnow was all right so he tossed it back again that isnt your name he said
he said shaking his head affirmatively a long cry came down the ravine
and the fisherman wondered if he had heard aright june the little girl gave a shrill answering cry but she did not move thar now she said whos that your mammy no taint
hits my step mammy im a goin to ketch hell now her innocent eyes turned sullen and her baby mouth tightened good lord said the fisherman startled and then he stopped the words were as innocent on her lips as a benediction
have you got a father like a flash her whole face changed
drawled a voice from the bushes and it had a tone that made the fisherman whirl suddenly a giant mountaineer stood on the bank above him with a winchester in the hollow of his arm how are you
the giants heavy eyes lifted quickly but he spoke to the girl you go on home
the girl shrank to the bushes but she cried sharply back dont you hurt him now dad he aint even got a pistol he aint no shet up
the little creature vanished and the mountaineer turned to the fisherman who had just put on a fresh minnow and tossed it into the river purty well thank you he said shortly how are you fine was the nonchalant answer
for a moment there was silence and a puzzled frown gathered on the mountaineers face thats a bright little girl of yours
no not in these mountains why the fisherman looked around and was almost startled by the fierce gaze of his questioner stop that please he said with a humourous smile you make me nervous
the mountaineers bushy brows came together across the bridge of his nose and his voice rumbled like distant thunder whats yo name stranger an whats yo business over hyeh dear me there you go you can see im fishing
but why does everybody in these mountains want to know my name you heerd me yes the fisherman turned again and saw the giants rugged face stern and pale with open anger now
he had not moved hand or foot and he said nothing but his mouth was set hard and his bewildered blue eyes had a glint in them that the mountaineer did not at the moment see he was leaning with one arm on the muzzle of his winchester his face had suddenly become suave and shrewd and now he laughed again
i might have a gun myself sometimes did you think you could scare me the mountaineer stared in genuine surprise twusnt no joke he said shortly
i reckon you dont know who i be i dont care who you are again the mountaineer stared no use gittin mad young feller he said coolly i mistaken ye fer somebody else an i axe yer pardon
when you git through fishin come up to the house right up the creek thar an ill give ye a dram thank you said the fisherman stiffly and the mountaineer turned silently away at the edge of the bushes he looked back the stranger was still fishing
and the old man went on with a shake of his head hell come he said to himself oh hell come that very point hale was debating with himself as he unavailingly cast his minnow into the swift water and slowly wound it in again
how did that old man know his name and would the old savage really have hurt him had he not found out who he was the little girl was a wonder evidently she had muffled his last name on purpose not knowing it herself
and it was a quick and cunning ruse he owed her something for that why did she try to protect him wonderful eyes too the little thing had deep and dark and how the flame did dart from them when she got angry he smiled remembering
he liked that and her hair it was exactly like the gold bronze on the wing of a wild turkey that he had shot the day before well it was noon now the fish had stopped biting after the wayward fashion of bass
he was hungry and thirsty and he would go up and see the little girl and the giant again and get that promised dram once more however he let his minnow float down into the shadow of a big rock
a man with a woman behind him both old and spectacled all three motionless on the bank and looking at him
only one answered hale with equal cheer the old woman pushed back her bonnet as he waded through the water towards them and he saw that she was puffing a clay pipe she looked at the fisherman and his tackle with the naive wonder of a child
and then she said in a commanding undertone go on billy
hale smiled he loved old people and two kinder faces he had never seen two gentler voices he had never heard
said the old man chuckling but thars a sight of em down thar below my old mill quietly the old woman hit the horse with a stripped branch of elm and the old gray with a switch of his tail started
but calmly she hit the horse again and the old man called back over his shoulder you come on down to the mill an ill show ye whar you can ketch a mess all right shouted hale holding back his laughter and on they went
the old man remonstrating in the kindliest way the old woman silently puffing her pipe and making no answer except to flay gently the rump of the lazy old gray hesitating hardly a moment hale unjointed his pole
left his minnow bucket where it was mounted his horse and rode up the path about him the beech leaves gave back the gold of the autumn sunlight and a little ravine high under the crest of the mottled mountain was on fire with the scarlet of maple
when he got to the bare crest of a little rise he could see up the creek a spiral of blue rising swiftly from a stone chimney geese and ducks were hunting crawfish in the little creek that ran from a milk house of logs
half hidden by willows at the edge of the forest and a turn in the path brought into view a log cabin well chinked with stones and plaster and with a well built porch a fence ran around the yard
gee haw i tell ye an ox wagon evidently was coming on and the road was so narrow that he turned his horse into the bushes to let it pass
still there was no sound of ox or wagon and the voice sounded like a childs so he went on at a walk in the thick sand and when he turned the bushes he pulled up again with a low laugh
in the road across the creek was a chubby tow haired boy with a long switch in his right hand and a pine dagger and a string in his left attached to the string and tied by one hind leg was a frog
the boy was using the switch as a goad and driving the frog as an ox and he was as earnest as though both were real i give ye a little rest now buck he said shaking his head earnestly
gee gee the frog hopped several times
said the little fellow panting in sympathy
then he looked up for an instant he seemed terrified but he did not run instead he stealthily shifted the pine dagger over to his right hand and the string to his left here boy said the fisherman with affected sternness
what are you doing with that dagger the boys breast heaved and his dirty fingers clenched tight around the whittled stick dont you talk to me that a way he said with an ominous shake of his head ill gut ye the fisherman threw back his head
and his peal of laughter did what his sternness failed to do the little fellow wheeled suddenly and his feet spurned the sand around the bushes for home the astonished frog dragged bumping after him well
the cars came scudding in towards dublin running evenly like pellets in the groove of the naas road
careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the continent sped its wealth and industry now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed their sympathy however was for the blue cars
the cars of their friends the french the french moreover were virtual victors their team had finished solidly they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning german car was reported a belgian
each blue car therefore received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car in one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present
in fact these four young men were almost hilarious they were charles segouin the owner of the car andre riviere a young electrician of canadian birth a huge hungarian named villona
and a neatly groomed young man named doyle segouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance he was about to start a motor establishment in paris
and riviere was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment these two young men who were cousins were also in good humour because of the success of the french cars villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon
and besides he was an optimist by nature the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be genuinely happy he was about twenty six years of age with a soft light brown moustache and rather innocent looking grey eyes
his father who had begun life as an advanced nationalist had modified his views early he had made his money as a butcher in kingstown and by opening shops in dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over
he had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the dublin newspapers as a merchant prince he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big catholic college
and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to study law jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while he had money and he was popular and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles
his father remonstrative but covertly proud of the excess had paid his bills and brought him home
who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in france such a person as his father agreed was well worth knowing even if he had not been the charming companion he was
villona was entertaining also a brilliant pianist but unfortunately very poor the car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth the two cousins sat on the front seat jimmy and his hungarian friend sat behind
decidedly villona was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road the frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase
this was not altogether pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind besides villonas humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car too
rapid motion through space elates one so does notoriety so does the possession of money these were three good reasons for jimmys excitement he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these continentals
at the control segouin had presented him to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused murmur of compliment the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth
it was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks then as to money he really had a great sum under his control
but jimmy who in spite of temporary errors was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness
and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance it was a serious thing for him
jimmy had a respect for his fathers shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to be made in the motor business pots of money moreover segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth
jimmy set out to translate into days work that lordly car in which he sat how smoothly it ran in what style they had come careering along the country roads the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life
and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal they drove down dame street the street was busy with unusual traffic loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram drivers
near the bank segouin drew up and jimmy and his friend alighted a little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor the party was to dine together that evening in segouins hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was staying with him
were to go home to dress the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers they walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise while the city hung its pale globes of light above them
in a haze of summer evening in jimmys house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion a certain pride mingled with his parents trepidation a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue
and as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable his father therefore was unusually friendly with villona
and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner the dinner was excellent exquisite
segouin jimmy decided had a very refined taste the party was increased by a young englishman named routh whom jimmy had seen with segouin at cambridge the young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps
they talked volubly and with little reserve jimmy whose imagination was kindling conceived the lively youth of the frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishmans manner a graceful image of his he thought and a just one
he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation the five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened villona with immense respect began to discover to the mildly surprised englishman the beauties of the english madrigal
riviere not wholly ingenuously undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians the resonant voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters
when segouin shepherded his party into politics here was congenial ground for all jimmy under generous influences felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him he aroused the torpid routh at last
the room grew doubly hot and segouins task grew harder each moment there was even danger of personal spite the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity and when the toast had been drunk he threw open a window significantly
that night the city wore the mask of a capital the five young men strolled along stephens green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke they talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders the people made way for them
at the corner of grafton street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party andre its farley
a torrent of talk followed farley was an american no one knew very well what the talk was about villona and riviere were the noisiest but all the men were excited they got up on a car squeezing themselves together amid much laughter
to a music of merry bells
they were walking out of kingstown station the ticket collector saluted jimmy he was an old man fine night sir it was a serene summer night the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet
they proceeded towards it with linked arms singing cadet roussel in chorus stamping their feet at every ho ho hohe vraiment they got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the americans yacht there was to be supper music cards
villona said with conviction it is delightful there was a yacht piano in the cabin villona played a waltz for farley and riviere farley acting as cavalier and riviere as lady
then an impromptu square dance the men devising original figures what merriment jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at least then farley got out of breath and cried stop
a man brought in a light supper and the young men sat down to it for forms sake they drank however it was bohemian they drank ireland england france hungary the united states of america jimmy made a speech a long speech
villona saying hear hear whenever there was a pause there was a great clapping of hands when he sat down it must have been a good speech farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly what jovial fellows what good company they were cards cards
the table was cleared villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them the other men played game after game flinging themselves boldly into the adventure they drank the health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds
jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience the wit was flashing play ran very high and paper began to pass jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards
they were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop it was getting late someone gave the toast of the yacht the belle of newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish the piano had stopped villona must have gone up on deck
it was a terrible game they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck jimmy understood that the game lay between routh and segouin what excitement jimmy was excited too he would lose of course how much had he written away
the men rose to their feet to play the last tricks talking and gesticulating routh won the cabin shook with the young mens cheering and the cards were bundled together they began then to gather in what they had won farley and jimmy were the heaviest losers
he knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly he leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands counting the beats of his temples
the cabin door opened and he saw the hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light
laura went down stairs knocked at the study door and entered scarcely waiting for the response senator dilworthy was alone with an open bible in his hand upside down laura smiled and said forgetting her acquired correctness of speech it is only me
ah come in sit down and the senator closed the book and laid it down i wanted to see you
and the senator beamed with his own congressional wit in the committee of the whole things are working very well we have made ever so much progress in a week i believe that you and i together could run this government beautifully uncle the senator beamed again
he liked to be called uncle by this beautiful woman did you see hopperson last night after the congressional prayer meeting yes he came hes a kind of eh he is one of my friends laura hes a fine man a very fine man
i dont know any man in congress id sooner go to for help in any christian work what did he say oh he beat around a little he said he should like to help the negro his heart went out to the negro and all that plenty of them say that but he was a little afraid of the tennessee land bill
if senator dilworthy wasnt in it he should suspect there was a fraud on the government he said that did he yes and he said he felt he couldnt vote for it he was shy not shy child cautious hes a very cautious man
i have been with him a great deal on conference committees he wants reasons good ones didnt you show him he was in error about the bill i did i went over the whole thing i had to tell him some of the side arrangements some of the you didnt mention me
oh no i told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy part of it as you are daft is a little strong laura but you know that i wouldnt touch this bill
and for the good of the colored race much as i am interested in the heirs of this property and would like to have them succeed laura looked a little incredulous and the senator proceeded dont misunderstand me i dont deny that it is for the interest of all of us that this bill should go through and it will
i have no concealments from you but i have one principle in my public life which i should like you to keep in mind it has always been my guide i never push a private interest if it is not justified and ennobled by some larger public good
if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow men the senator spoke with feeling and then added i hope you showed hopperson that our motives were pure yes and he seemed to have a new light on the measure i think will vote for it
i hope so his name will give tone and strength to it i knew you would only have to show him that it was just and pure in order to secure his cordial support i think i convinced him yes i am perfectly sure he will vote right now
thats good thats good said the senator smiling and rubbing his hands is there anything more youll find some changes in that i guess handing the senator a printed list of names those checked off are all right ah m m
running his eye down the list thats encouraging what is the c before some of the names and the b b those are my private marks that c stands for convinced with argument
i expect to see the chairman of the committee to day mister buckstone
but he has charitable impulses if we secure him we shall have a favorable report by the committee
oh i saw senator balloon he will help us i suppose balloon is a whole hearted fellow i cant help loving that man for all his drollery and waggishness he puts on an air of levity sometimes but there aint a man in the senate knows the scriptures as he does
he did not make any objections not exactly he said shall i tell you what he said asked laura glancing furtively at him certainly he said he had no doubt it was a good thing if senator dilworthy was in it it would pay to look into it
the senator laughed but rather feebly and said balloon is always full of his jokes i explained it to him he said it was all right he only wanted a word with you continued laura he is a handsome old gentleman and he is gallant for an old man
my daughter said the senator with a grave look i trust there was nothing free in his manner free repeated laura with indignation in her face with me there there child i meant nothing balloon talks a little freely sometimes with men
but he is right at heart his term expires next year and i fear we shall lose him he seemed to be packing the day i was there his rooms were full of dry goods boxes into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes and stuff
i suppose he will paint pub docs on them and frank them home thats good economy isnt it yes yes but child all congressmen do that it may not be strictly honest indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with the clothes
its a funny world good bye uncle im going to see that chairman and humming a cheery opera air she departed to her room to dress for going out before she did that however she took out her note book and was soon deep in its contents marking dashing
erasing figuring and talking to herself free i wonder what dilworthy does think of me anyway one two eight seventeen
wouldnt dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some of the things balloon did say to me there hoppersons influence ought to count twenty the sanctimonious old curmudgeon son in law sinecure in the negro institution that about gauges him the three committeemen
sons in law nothing like a son in law here in washington or a brother in law and everybody has em lets see sixty one with places twenty five persuaded it is getting on well have two thirds of congress in time dilworthy must surely know i understand him
uncle dilworthy uncle balloon tells very amusing stories when ladies are not present i should think so m m eighty five there i must find that chairman queer buckstone acts
seemed to be in love i was sure of it he promised to come here and he hasnt strange very strange i must chance to meet him to day laura dressed and went out thinking she was perhaps too early for mister buckstone to come from the house
but as he lodged near the bookstore she would drop in there and keep a look out for him while laura is on her errand to find mister buckstone it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of washington life as senator dilworthy gave her credit for
and more than she thought proper to tell him she was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of newspaper row and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage
they were always talking in the row everlastingly gossiping bantering and sarcastically praising things and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and persiflage colonel sellers liked this talk amazingly though he was sometimes a little at sea in it
and perhaps that didnt lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondents it seems that they had got hold of the dry goods box packing story about balloon one day and were talking it over when the colonel came in the colonel wanted to know all about it and hicks told him
and then hicks went on with a serious air colonel if you register a letter it means that it is of value doesnt it and if you pay fifteen cents for registering it the government will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it is lost isnt that so
yes i suppose its so well senator balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those seven huge boxes of old clothes and shipped that ton of second hand rubbish old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as registered matter
it was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch of humor about it too i think there is more real talent among our public men of to day than there was among those of old times a far more fertile fancy a much happier ingenuity
now colonel can you picture jefferson or washington or john adams franking their wardrobes through the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents statesmen were dull creatures in those days
i have a much greater admiration for senator balloon yes balloon is a man of parts there is no denying it i think so he is spoken of for the post of minister to china or austria and i hope will be appointed
what we want abroad is good examples of the national character john jay and benjamin franklin were well enough in their day but the nation has made progress since then balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself
yes and balloon has had a good deal of public experience he is an old friend of mine he was governor of one of the territories a while and was very satisfactory indeed he was he was ex officio indian agent too
whose land had been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization but balloon knew their needs better he built a government saw mill on the reservation with the money and the lumber sold for enormous prices a relative of his did all the work free of charge
that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber would bring but the poor injuns not that i care much for injuns what did he do for them gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with governor balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor indians but balloon is not alone
we have many truly noble statesmen in our countrys service like balloon the senate is full of them dont you think so colonel well i dunno i honor my countrys public servants as much as any one can i meet them sir every day and the more i see of them
of securing their services few lands are so blest that is true colonel to be sure you can buy now and then a senator or a representative but they do not know it is wrong and so they are not ashamed of it they are gentle and confiding and childlike
and in my opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of
i quite agree with you colonel sellers well hesitated the colonel i am afraid some of them do buy their seats yes i am afraid they do but as senator dilworthy himself said to me it is sinful it is very wrong it is shameful
heaven protect me from such a charge that is what dilworthy said and yet when you come to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men sir if the country were opposed to to bribery it is a harsh term i do not like to use it
he had found at last that the draughts containing dissolved pearls which the quack doctor leoni di spoleto prescribed for him as if he desired to adapt his remedies rather to the riches of his patient than to his necessities
were useless and unavailing and so he had come to understand that he must part from those gentle tongued women of his those sweet voiced poets his palaces and their rich hangings therefore he had summoned to give him absolution for his sins
in a man of less high place they might perhaps have been called crimes the dominican giralamo francesco savonarola it was not however without an inward fear against which the praises of his friends availed nothing
that the pleasure seeker and usurper awaited that severe and gloomy preacher by whose words all florence was stirred and on whose pardon henceforth depended all his hope for another world indeed savonarola was one of those men of stone
coming like the statue of the commandante to knock at the door of a don giovanni and in the midst of feast and orgy to announce that it is even now the moment to begin to think of heaven he had been born at ferrara
had fled from his fathers house and had taken the vows in the cloister of dominican monks at florence there where he was appointed by his superiors to give lessons in philosophy the young novice had from the first to battle against the defects of a voice that was both harsh and weak
a defective pronunciation and above all the depression of his physical powers exhausted as they were by too severe abstinence savonarola from that time condemned himself to the most absolute seclusion and disappeared in the depths of his convent
as if the slab of his tomb had already fallen over him there kneeling on the flags praying unceasingly before a wooden crucifix fevered by vigils and penances he soon passed out of contemplation into ecstasy and began to feel in himself
that inward prophetic impulse which summoned him to preach the reformation of the church nevertheless the reformation of savonarola more reverential than luthers which followed about five and twenty years later respected the thing while attacking the man
and had as its aim the altering of teaching that was human not faith that was of god he did not work like the german monk by reasoning but by enthusiasm with him logic always gave way before inspiration he was not a theologian
but a prophet yet although hitherto he had bowed his head before the authority of the church he had already raised it against the temporal power to him religion and liberty appeared as two virgins equally sacred
the result of this was that so long as lorenzo lived in riches happiness and magnificence savonarola had never been willing whatever entreaties were made to sanction by his presence a power which he considered illegitimate
but lorenzo on his deathbed sent for him and that was another matter the austere preacher set forth at once bareheaded and barefoot hoping to save not only the soul of the dying man but also the liberty of the republic
lorenzo as we have said was awaiting the arrival of savonarola with an impatience mixed with uneasiness so that when he heard the sound of his steps his pale face took a yet more deathlike tinge
appeared on the threshold when he perceived him lorenzo dei medici reading in his marble brow the inflexibility of a statue fell back on his bed breathing a sigh so profound that one might have supposed it was his last
then he advanced with a slow and solemn step towards the bed lorenzo watched his approach with terror then when he was close beside him he cried o my father i have been a very great sinner the mercy of god is infinite replied the monk
you believe then that god will forgive my sins cried the dying man renewing his hope as he heard from the lips of the monk such unexpected words your sins and also your crimes god will forgive them all replied savonarola
god will forgive your vanities your adulterous pleasures your obscene festivals so much for your sins
francesco frescobaldi and more than three hundred others whose names were none the less dear to florence because they were less renowned so much for your crimes and at each of these names which savonarola pronounced slowly his eyes fixed on the dying man
he replied with a groan which proved the monks memory to be only too true then at last when he had finished lorenzo asked in a doubtful tone then do you believe my father that god will forgive me everything both my sins and my crimes
everything said savonarola but on three conditions what are they asked the dying man the first said savonarola is that you feel a complete faith in the power and the mercy of god
my father replied lorenzo eagerly i feel this faith in the very depths of my heart the second said savonarola is that you give back the property of others which you have unjustly confiscated and kept
my father shall i have time asked the dying man god will give it to you replied the monk
exclaimed lorenzo falling back on his bed and shaking his head never the monk without replying a single word made a step to withdraw my father my father said the dying man do not leave me thus have pity on me have pity on florence said the monk
but my father cried lorenzo florence is free florence is happy florence is a slave florence is poor cried savonarola poor in genius poor in money and poor in courage poor in genius because after you lorenzo
will come your son piero poor in money because from the funds of the republic you have kept up the magnificence of your family and the credit of your business houses poor in courage because you have robbed the rightful magistrates of the authority which was constitutionally theirs
and diverted the citizens from the double path of military and civil life wherein before they were enervated by your luxuries they had displayed the virtues of the ancients and therefore when the day shall dawn which is not far distant continued the monk
it is not i who desire it it is the lord replied savonarola coldly impossible impossible murmured lorenzo very well then die as you have lived cried the monk in the midst of your courtiers and flatterers
let them ruin your soul as they have ruined your body and at these words the austere dominican without listening to the cries of the dying man left the room as he had entered it with face and step unaltered far above human things he seemed to soar
a spirit already detached from the earth at the cry which broke from lorenzo dei medici when he saw him disappear
and found their friend convulsively clutching in his arms a magnificent crucifix which he had just taken down from the bed head in vain did they try to reassure him with friendly words lorenzo the magnificent only replied with sobs
his lips clinging to the feet of the christ he breathed his last in the arms of these three men of whom the most fortunate though all three were young was not destined to survive him more than two years
chapter fifteen champion buffalo killer shortly after the adventures mentioned in the preceding chapter i had my celebrated buffalo hunt with billy comstock a noted scout guide and interpreter
who was then chief of scouts at fort wallace kansas comstock had the reputation for a long time of being a most successful buffalo hunter and the officers in particular who had seen him kill buffaloes were very desirous of backing him in a match against me
it was accordingly arranged that i should shoot him a buffalo killing match and the preliminaries were easily and satisfactorily agreed upon we were to hunt one day of eight hours beginning at eight oclock in the morning and closing at four oclock in the afternoon
the wager was five hundred dollars a side and the man who should kill the greater number of buffaloes from on horseback was to be declared the winner the hunt took place about twenty miles east of sheridan and as it had been pretty well advertised and noised abroad
a large crowd witnessed the interesting and exciting scene an excursion party mostly from saint louis consisting of about a hundred gentlemen and ladies came out on a special train to view the sport and among the number was my wife with little baby arta
the buffaloes were quite plenty and it was agreed that we should go into the same herd at the same time and make a run as we called it each one killing as many as possible a referee was to follow each of us on horseback when we entered the herd and count the buffaloes killed by each man
when they were to come up as near as they pleased and witness the chase we were fortunate in the first run in getting good ground comstock was mounted on one of his favorite horses while i rode old brigham i felt confident that i had the advantage of comstock in two things
first i had the best buffalo horse that ever made a track and second i was using what was known at that time as the needle gun a breech loading springfield rifle calibre fifty it was my favorite old lucretia which has already been introduced to the notice of the reader
while comstock was armed with a henry rifle and although he could fire a few shots quicker than i could yet i was pretty certain that it did not carry powder and lead enough to do execution equal to my calibre fifty at last the time came to begin the match
comstock and i dashed into a herd followed by the referees the buffaloes separated comstock took the left bunch and i the right my great forte in killing buffaloes from horseback was to get them circling by riding my horse at the head of the herd shooting the leaders
till they would finally circle round and round on this morning the buffaloes were very accommodating
i had nursed my buffaloes as a billiard player does the balls when he makes a big run after the result of the first run had been duly announced our saint louis excursion friends who had approached to the place where we had stopped set out a lot of champagne which they had brought with them
and which proved a good drink on a kansas prairie and a buffalo hunter was a good man to get away with it while taking a short rest we suddenly spied another herd of buffaloes coming toward us it was only a small drove and we at once prepared to give the animals a lively reception
they proved to be a herd of cows and calves which by the way are quicker in their movements than the bulls we charged in among them and i concluded my run with a score of eighteen while comstock killed fourteen
we came up close to another herd as i was so far ahead of my competitor in the number killed i thought i could afford to give an extra exhibition of my skill i had told the ladies that i would on the next run ride my horse without saddle or bridle
and i remember one fair lady who endeavored to prevail upon me not to attempt it thats nothing at all said i i have done it many a time and old brigham knows as well as i what i am doing and sometimes a great deal better so leaving my saddle and bridle with the wagons
we rode to the windward of the buffaloes as usual and when within a few hundred yards of them we dashed into the herd i soon had thirteen laid out on the ground the last one of which i had driven down close to the wagons where the ladies were
it frightened some of the tender creatures to see the buffalo coming at full speed directly toward them but when he had got within fifty yards of one of the wagons i shot him dead in his tracks this made my sixty ninth buffalo and finished my third and last run
comstock having killed forty six as it was now late in the afternoon comstock and his backers gave up the idea that he could beat me and thereupon the referees declared me the winner of the match
they prepared to depart having declined an invitation to pass the night there
had attracted the attention of the indians who overtook him and his companion when they had gone about half a mile after surrounding the two men they suddenly attacked them they killed scalped and robbed comstock but grover although severely wounded made his escape
owing to the fleetness of the excellent horse which he was riding this sad event occurred august twenty seventh eighteen sixty eight on our way back to camp we took with us some of the choice meat and finest heads
in this connection it will not be out of place to state that during the time i was hunting for the kansas pacific i always brought into camp the best buffalo heads and turned them over to the company who found a very good use for them they had them mounted in the best possible manner
and sent them to all the principal cities and railroad centers in the country having them placed in prominent positions at the leading hotels depots and other public buildings as a sort of trade mark or advertisement of the kansas pacific railroad
and to day they attract the attention of the traveler almost everywhere whenever i am traveling over the country and see one of these trade marks i feel pretty certain that i was the cause of the death of the old fellow whose body it once ornamented
my services as a hunter were not any longer required at this time there was a general indian war raging all along the western borders general sheridan had taken up his headquarters at fort hayes in order to be in the field to superintend the campaign in person
as scouts and guides were in great demand i concluded once more to take up my old avocation of scouting and guiding for the army having no suitable place in which to leave my old and faithful buffalo hunter brigham and not wishing to kill him by scouting
i determined to dispose of him i was very reluctant to part with him but i consoled myself with the thought that he would not be likely to receive harder usage in other hands than he had in mine i had several good offers to sell him
but at the suggestion of some gentlemen in sheridan all of whom were anxious to obtain possession of the horse i put him up at a raffle in order to give them all an equal chance of becoming the owner of the famous steed there were ten chances at thirty dollars each and they were all quickly taken
a purse of two hundred fifty dollars was made up to be given to the horse that could first reach wyandotte four miles distant the arrangement was carried out and brigham was entered as one of the contestants for the purse
everybody laughed at mister bonham when it became known that he was to ride that poky looking plug against the five thoroughbreds which were to take part in the race when all the preliminaries had been arranged the signal was given and off went the horses for wyandotte
for the first half mile several of the horses led brigham but on the second mile he began passing them one after the other and on the third mile he was in advance of them all and was showing them all the road at a lively rate on the fourth mile his rider let him out
and arrived at the hotel the home station in wyandotte a long way ahead of his fastest competitor everybody was surprised as well as disgusted that such a homely critter should be the winner brigham of course had already acquired a wide reputation
and his name and exploits had often appeared in the newspapers and when it was learned that this critter was none other than the identical buffalo hunting brigham nearly the whole crowd admitted that they had heard of him before and had they known him in the first place they certainly would have ruled him out
i finally lost track of brigham and for several years i did not know what had become of him three years ago while i was at memphis tennessee i met a mister wilcox who had been one of the superintendents of construction of the kansas pacific railroad and he informed me that he owned brigham
only a few miles out of town the next day i rode out with mister wilcox and took a look at the gallant old horse he was comfortably cared for in mister wilcoxs stable and looked the same clever pony that he always was it seemed as if he almost remembered me
and whenever i again visit memphis i shall surely go and see brigham if he is still alive but to return to the thread of my narrative from which i have wandered
chapter twenty six sight seeing general ord commanding the department of the platte at the time and who had been out on the alexis hunt had some business to attend to at fort mc pherson
and i accepted his invitation to ride over to the post with him in an ambulance on the way thither he asked me how i would like to have an officers commission in the regular army he said that general sheridan and himself had had some conversation about the matter
and if i wanted a commission one could easily be procured for me i thanked general ord for his kindness and said that although an officers commission in the regular army was a tempting prize yet i preferred to remain in the position i was then holding
having determined to visit new york i acted upon general sheridans suggestion and wrote to general stager from whom in a few days i received my railroad passes obtaining thirty days leave of absence from the department i struck out for the east
on arriving in chicago in february eighteen seventy two i was met at the depot by colonel m v sheridan who said that his brother the general had not yet returned
but had sent word that i was to be his and the colonels guest at their house while i remained in chicago i spent two or three days very pleasantly in the great city of the west meeting several of the gentlemen who had been out on the sheridan hunt in september general stager
colonel wilson editor of the journal mister sam johnson general rucker and others by all of whom i was most cordially received and well entertained i was introduced to quite a number of the best people of the city and was invited to several swell dinners
that it was more difficult for me to face the throng of beautiful ladies
i was to stop at niagara falls buffalo and rochester on my way to new york and he provided me with all the necessary railroad passes just as i was about to leave chicago i met professor henry a ward of rochester for whom during the previous year or two
i had collected a large number of specimens of wild animals he was on his way to rochester and kindly volunteered to act as my guide until we reached that point we spent one day in viewing the wonders of niagara
and i had the honor of receiving an invitation to dine with the mayor on arriving at new york i was met at the depot by mister j g hecksher who had been appointed as a committee of one to escort me to the union club
where james gordon bennett leonard w jerome and others were to give me an informal reception and where i was to make my headquarters during my visit in the great metropolis i had an elegant dinner at the club rooms with the gentlemen who had been out on the september hunt and other members of the club
he was delighted to see me and insisted on my becoming his guest he would listen to no excuses and on introducing me to messrs overton and blair proprietors of the brevoort they also gave me a pressing invitation to make my home at their house
i finally compromised the matter by agreeing to divide my time between the union club the brevoort house and ned buntlines quarters the next few days i spent in viewing the sights of new york everything being new and startling
convincing me that as yet i had seen but a small portion of the world i received numerous dinner invitations as well as invitations to visit different places of amusement and interest but as they came in so thick and fast i soon became badly demoralized and confused
i found i had accepted invitations to dine at half a dozen or more houses on the same day and at the same hour james gordon bennett had prepared a dinner for me at which quite a large number of his friends were to be present
but owing to my confusion arising from the many other invitations i had received i forgot all about it and dined elsewhere this was a bad break but i did not learn of my mistake until next day when at the union club house several gentlemen among them lawrence jerome
and why i had not put in an appearance at bennetts dinner they said that bennett had taken great pains to give me a splendid reception that the party had waited till nine oclock for me and that my non arrival caused considerable disappointment
i apologized as well as i could by saying that i had been out on a scout and had got lost and had forgotten all about the dinner and expressed my regret for the disappointment i had created by my forgetfulness august belmont the banker being near said
never mind gentlemen ill give cody a dinner at my house thank you sir said i i see you are determined that i shall not run short of rations while i am in the city ill be there sure
both mister jerome and mister hecksher told me that i must not disappoint mister belmont for his dinners were splendid affairs i made a note of the date and at the appointed time i was promptly at mister belmonts mansion where i spent a very enjoyable evening
mister bennett who was among the guests having forgiven my carelessness invited me to accompany him to the liederkranz masked ball which was to take place in a few evenings and would be a grand spectacle together we attended the ball and during the evening i was well entertained
the dancers kept on their masks until midnight and the merry and motley throng presented a brilliant scene moving gracefully beneath the bright gas light to the inspiriting music to me it was a novel and entertaining sight
and exhibited some of my backwoods steps which although not as graceful as some were a great deal more emphatic but when i undertook to do artistic dancing i found i was decidedly out of place in that crowd and i accordingly withdrew from the floor
i occasionally passed an evening at niblos garden viewing the many beauties of the black crook which was then having its long run under the management of jarrett and palmer whose acquaintance i had made and who extended to me the freedom of the theater
ned buntline and fred maeder had dramatized one of the stories which the former had written about me for the new york weekly the drama was called buffalo bill the king of border men while i was in new york it was produced at the bowery theater
and of course i was present on the opening night a private box having been reserved for me the theater was packed every seat being occupied as well as the standing room the drama was played smoothly and created a great deal of enthusiasm
the audience upon learning that the real buffalo bill was present gave several cheers between the acts and i was called on to come out on the stage and make a speech
and that i should be introduced to mister studley i finally consented and the next moment i found myself standing behind the footlights and in front of an audience for the first time in my life i looked up then down then on each side and everywhere i saw a sea of human faces
but what they were i could not for the life of me tell nor could any one else in the house my utterances were inaudible even to the leader of the orchestra mister dean who was sitting only a few feet in front of me bowing to the audience i beat a hasty retreat into one of the canons of the stage
i never felt more relieved in my life than when i got out of the view of that immense crowd that evening mister freleigh offered to give me five hundred dollars a week to play the part of buffalo bill myself
and that he might as well try to make an actor out of a government mule i thanked him for the generous offer which i had to decline owing to a lack of confidence in myself or as some people might express it i didnt have the requisite cheek to undertake a thing of that sort
the play of buffalo bill had a very successful run of six or eight weeks and was afterwards produced in all the principal cities of the country everywhere being received with genuine enthusiasm
i met him soon after he got into town in answer to a question how i was enjoying myself i replied that i had struck the best camp i had ever seen and if he didnt have any objections i would like to have my leave of absence extended about ten days
this he willingly did and then informed me that my services would soon be required at fort mc pherson as there was to be an expedition sent out from that point at westchester pennsylvania i had some relatives living whom i had never seen
and now being so near i determined to make them a visit upon mentioning the matter to buntline he suggested that we should together take a trip to philadelphia and thence run out to westchester
among them an elderly lady who was my grandmother as he informed me he told me that my aunt eliza his first wife was dead and that he had married a second time lizzie guss my cousin i thought was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen
they were all very anxious to have us remain several days but as i had some business to attend to in new york i was obliged to return that day assuring them however that i would visit them again soon i bade them adieu and with buntline took the train for new york
sdeath cried my great grandfather clapping his hand upon his nose
now my great grandfathers nose was for all the world like unto the noses of all the men women and children whom pantagruel found dwelling upon the island of ennasin
by the way if you would know the strange way of getting a kin amongst so flat nosed a people you must read the book find it out yourself you never can
you must mean your uncles replied my great grandmother my great grandfather was convinced he untwisted the paper and signed the article
so that my father had the jointure to pay a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly on michaelmas and lady day during all that time no man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my father
as soon as ever he enterd upon the odd fifty he generally gave a loud hem
inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his wig lookd at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds without pulling out his handkerchief and wiping his temples
and feel pity for the force of education and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors for three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses
so that the whimsicality of my fathers brain was far from having the whole honour of this as it had of almost all his other strange notions for in a great measure he might be said to have suckd this in with his mothers milk
that he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses and for the contrary reason he would generally add
that it must be one of the greatest problems in civil life where the same number of long and jolly noses following one another in a direct line
i mean the external organ of smelling or that part of man which stands prominent in his face and which painters say in good jolly noses and well proportioned faces should comprehend a full third that is measured downwards from the setting on of the hair
did he read such books and observe such facts and think such thoughts as would eternally be making him change sides now my father as i told you last year detested all this he pickd up an opinion sir
as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple it becomes his own and if he is a man of spirit he would lose his life rather than give it up
the apple is as much franks apple as johns pray mister shandy what patent has he to shew for it and how did it begin to be his was it when he set his heart upon it or when he gathered it
or when he chewd it or when he roasted it or when he peeld or when he brought it home or when he digested or when he for tis plain sir if the first picking up of the apple made it not his that no subsequent act could
brother didius tribonius will answer now tribonius the civilian and church lawyers beard being three inches and a half and three eighths longer than didius his beard
that the sweat of a mans brows and the exsudations of a mans brains are as much a mans own property as the breeches upon his backside
they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as in the case above so that they might well and truly be said to be of his own goods and chattels accordingly he held fast by em both by teeth and claws
would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on and in a word would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and breast works as my uncle toby would a citadel
by the trotting of my lean horse the thing is incredible and i am quite lost in my understanding when i am considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon worse subjects
what was to be had however he set the greater store by and though my father would oft times sport with my uncle tobys library which by the bye was ridiculous enough
but that was not thy transgression my dear uncle here but why here rather than in any other part of my story i am not able to tell but here it is my heart stops me
whilst i am pouring forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee and veneration for the excellency of thy character that ever virtue and nature kindled in a nephews bosom
devouredst no mans bread gently with faithful trim behind thee didst thou amble round the little circle of thy pleasures jostling no creature in thy way for each ones sorrows thou hadst a tear
for each mans need thou hadst a shilling whilst i am worth one to pay a weeder thy path from thy door to thy bowling green shall never be grown up
my father had such a skirmishing cutting kind of a slashing way with him in his disputations thrusting and ripping and giving every one a stroke to remember him by in his turn
for that the taylor in ripping them up in order to turn them had found they had been turnd before then turn them again brother said my father rapidly for there will be many a turning of em yet before alls done in the affair
they are as rotten as dirt said the corporal then by all means said my father bespeak a new pair brother for though i know continued my father turning himself to the company
that widow wadman has been deeply in love with my brother toby for many years and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion yet now that she has caught him her fever will be passd its height
into a corps no matter whether he loves the service or no being once in it he acts as if he did and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse
the hypothesis like the rest of my fathers was plausible enough and my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it in which trim stood ready to second him but my father had not drawn his conclusion
for this reason continued my father stating the case over again notwithstanding all the world knows that missus wadman affects my brother toby and my brother toby contrariwise affects missus wadman
and no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night yet will i answer for it that this self same tune will not be playd this twelvemonth
we have taken our measures badly quoth my uncle toby looking up interrogatively in trims face i would lay my montero cap said trim
now trims montero cap as i once told you was his constant wager and having furbishd it up that very night in order to go upon the attack it made the odds look more considerable
i would lay an please your honour my montero cap to a shilling was it proper continued trim making a bow to offer a wager before your honours there is nothing improper in it said my father
that widow wadman an please your worship cannot hold it out ten days and whence cried slop jeeringly hast thou all this knowledge of woman friend
by falling in love with a popish clergy woman said trim twas a beguine said my uncle toby doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction
and my father taking that very crisis to fall in helter skelter upon the whole order of nuns and beguines a set of silly fusty baggages slop could not stand it and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his breeches
and perhaps it is as well for thee tho not so well for me that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head and that i am able to write it to thee had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots
missus shandy being now close beside me preparing for bed i have thrown together without order and just as they have come into my mind such hints and documents as i deem may be of use to thee
though i perceive from a glow in my cheek that i blush as i begin to speak to thee upon the subject as well knowing notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy how few of its offices thou neglectest
yet i would remind thee of one during the continuance of thy courtship in a particular manner which i would not have omitted and that is never to go forth upon the enterprize whether it be in the morning or the afternoon
without first recommending thyself to the protection of almighty god that he may defend thee from the evil one shave the whole top of thy crown clean
once at least every four or five days but oftner if convenient lest in taking off thy wig before her thro absence of mind she should be able to discover how much has been cut away by time how much by trim
whatever thou hast to say be it more or less forget not to utter it in a low soft tone of voice silence and whatever approaches it weaves dreams of midnight secrecy into the brain
for this cause if thou canst help it never throw down the tongs and poker avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her
they are all books which excite laughter and thou knowest dear toby that there is no passion so serious as lust stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt before thou enterest her parlour
there is nothing further for thee which occurs to me at present unless the breaking out of a fresh war so wishing every thing dear toby for best i rest thy affectionate brother walter shandy
whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions my uncle toby and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack as the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside at least for the present
there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next morning so accordingly it was resolvd upon for eleven oclock
but the account of this is worth more than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth alluding to the first edition volume of such a work as this
could have vented such an insinuation he was however frank and generous in his nature and at all times open to conviction so that he had scarce got to the last word of this ungracious retort
when his conscience smote him my mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under his right in such wise that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of his
she raised her fingers and let them fall it could scarce be calld a tap or if it was a tap
whether twas a tap of remonstrance or a tap of confession my father who was all sensibilities from head to foot
conscience redoubled her blow he turnd his face suddenly the other way and my mother supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards by a cross movement of her right leg
a thin blue chill pellucid chrystal with all its humours so at rest the least mote or speck of desire might have been seen at the bottom of it had it existed
my mother madam was so at no time either by nature by institution or example a temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of the year
which having little or no meaning in them nature is oft times obliged to find one and as for my fathers example twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto
that twas the whole business of his life to keep all fancies of that kind out of her head nature had done her part to have spared him this trouble and what was not a little inconsistent my father knew it
and here am i sitting this twelfth day of august seventeen sixty six in a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers without either wig or cap on a most tragicomical completion of his prediction
for certainly key holes were made for other purposes and considering the act as an act which interfered with a true proposition and denied a key hole to be what it was
it became a violation of nature and was so far you see criminal it is for this reason an please your reverences that key holes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness than all other holes
though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle tobys great ramallie wig into pipes yet the time was too short to produce any great effects from it it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of his old campaign trunk
twould have cost her ladyship a smile it curld every where but where the corporal would have it and where a buckle or two in his opinion would have done it honour he could as soon have raised the dead
such it was or rather such would it have seemd upon any other brow but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle tobys assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself
and nature had moreover wrote gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance that even his tarnishd gold laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became him
in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had been made by a total inactivity in my uncle tobys life for he seldom went further than the bowling green
and to shorten all description they shone so bright against the sun that morning and had so metallick and doughty an air with them that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armour nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination
and with his hair tuckd up under his montero cap which he had furbishd up for the occasion
a whiff of military pride had puffd out his shirt at the wrist and upon that in a black leather thong clippd into a tassel beyond the knot hung the corporals stick my uncle toby carried his cane
like a pike it looks well at least quoth my father to himself
my uncle toby turnd his head more than once behind him to see how he was supported by the corporal and the corporal as oft as he did it gave a slight flourish with his stick
but not vapouringly and with the sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement bid his honour never fear now my uncle toby did fear and grievously too
infinite was his pity nor would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further at least upon one leg to have wiped away a tear from a womans eye
and yet excepting once that he was beguiled into it by missus wadman he had never looked stedfastly into one and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart
she cannot quoth my uncle toby halting when they had marchd up to within twenty paces of missus wadmans door she cannot corporal take it amiss
your honour replied the corporal knows of toms misfortunes but this affair has nothing to do with them any further than this
that if tom had not married the widow or had it pleased god after their marriage that they had but put pork into their sausages the honest soul had never been taken out of his warm bed and draggd to the inquisition
when once a poor creature is in he is in an please your honour for ever tis very true said my uncle toby looking gravely at missus wadmans house as he spoke nothing
said my uncle toby musing whilst a man is free cried the corporal giving a flourish with his stick thus
a thousand of my fathers most subtle syllogisms could not have said more for celibacy my uncle toby lookd earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling green
chapter four i am by no means sure that if the good people of milby had known the truth about the countess czerlaski they would not have been considerably disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined
nice distinctions are troublesome it is so much easier to say that a thing is black than to discriminate the particular shade of brown blue or green to which it really belongs
besides think of all the virtuous declamation all the penetrating observation which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position that the countess was a very objectionable person indeed
and which would be utterly overturned and nullified by the destruction of that premiss missus phipps the bankers wife and missus landor the attorneys wife had invested part of their reputation for acuteness
had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the other ladys manifest superiority in personal charms miss phippss stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire
instead of looking down from a mount of virtue with an aureole round its head would then be seen on the same level and in the same light as the countess czerlaskis diana like form and well chosen drapery
miss phipps for her part didnt like dressing for effect she had always avoided that style of appearance which was calculated to create a sensation
then what amusing innuendoes of the milby gentlemen over their wine would have been entirely frustrated and reduced to nought if you had told them that the countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanours which demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society
had subsequently given dancing lessons in the metropolis that mister bridmain was neither more nor less than her half brother who by unimpeached integrity and industry
had won a partnership in a silk manufactory and thereby a moderate fortune that enabled him to retire as you see to study politics the weather and the art of conversation at his leisure
mister bridmain in fact quadragenarian bachelor as he was felt extremely well pleased to receive his sister in her widowhood and to shine in the reflected light of her beauty and title
every man who is not a monster a mathematician or a mad philosopher is the slave of some woman or other mister bridmain had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister and though his soul was a very little one
of the smallest description indeed he would not have ventured to call it his own he might be slightly recalcitrant now and then as is the habit of long eared pachyderms under the thong of the fair countesss tongue
and there was always the possibility that mister bridmains first nuptials might occur before the countess was quite sure of her second as it was however he submitted to all his sisters caprices
as personages on the debatable ground between aristocracy and commonalty instead of settling in some spot where his five hundred a year might have won him the definite dignity of a parochial magnate
whom he initiated into the mysteries of the pas de bas and the lancers quadrilles she had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with czerlaski who had taken her to paris and germany
not indeed any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom but much external polish and certain practical conclusions of a very decided kind
one of these conclusions was that there were things more solid in life than fine whiskers and a title and that in accepting a second husband
was difficult to be met with at watering places which were already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauties and were chiefly stocked with men whose whiskers might be dyed and whose incomes were still more problematic
so she had determined on trying a neighbourhood where people were extremely well acquainted with each others affairs and where the women were mostly ill dressed and ugly
and give him at least a sort of cousinship to the quarter sessions all this which was the simple truth would have seemed extremely flat to the gossips of milby who had made up their minds to something much more exciting
there was nothing here so very detestable it is true the countess was a little vain a little ambitious a little selfish a little shallow and frivolous a little given to white lies but
who considers such slight blemishes such moral pimples as these disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society indeed
the severest ladies in milby would have been perfectly aware that these characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the countess czerlaski and themselves and since it was clear there was a wide distinction
why it must lie in the possession of some vices from which they were undeniably free hence it came to pass that milby respectability refused to recognize the countess czerlaski
in spite of her assiduous church going and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed at the extreme paucity of the congregations on ash wednesdays
so she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well acquainted with each others private affairs
and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a gorgon and she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society
and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter she had serious intentions of becoming quite pious without any reserves when she had once got her carriage and settlement
the countess did not quote sophocles but she said to herself only this little bit of pretence and vanity and then i will be quite good and make myself quite safe for another world
for you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the countess was absorbingly devoted and to whose desires she made everything else subservient namely caroline czerlaski nee bridmain
thus there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and attentions to mister and missus barton
still their friendship by no means adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to milby and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new change of residence to her brother
chapter seventeen the death of joseph herods brother which had been signified to herod in dreams how herod was preserved twice after a wonderful manner he cuts off the head of pappus
who was the murderer of his brother and sends that head to his other brother pheroras
one in the mean time herods affairs in judea were in an ill state he had left his brother joseph with full power but had charged him to make no attempts against antigonus till his return
for that machaerus would not be such an assistant as he could depend on as it appeared by what he had done already
and marched towards jericho with five cohorts which machaerus sent with him
for these cohorts were new raised men gathered out of syria and here was no mixture of those called veteran soldiers among them who might have supported those that were unskillful in war two
and there drowned them there was a great change made also in idumea where machaerus was building a wall about one of the fortresses which was called gittha but herod had not yet been informed of these things
to assist herod and followed himself soon after with the rest of his army three now when herod was at daphne by antioch he had some dreams which clearly foreboded his brothers death
and as he leaped out of his bed in a disturbed manner there came messengers that acquainted him with that calamity so when he had lamented this misfortune for a while he put off the main part of his mourning and made haste to march against his enemies
he made an irruption into galilee and met his enemies and drove them back to the place which they had left
yet was he forced by a most terrible storm to pitch his camp in the neighboring villages before he could take it but when after a few days time the second legion that came from antony joined themselves to him
he had the reputation of being very dear to god for that evening there feasted with him many of the principal men and after that feast was over and all the guests were gone out the house fell down immediately
and began to fight with those in his forefront yet durst they not be so very bold as to engage the romans hand to hand but threw stones and darts at them at a distance by which means they wounded a considerable number
in which action herods own side was wounded with a dart five now as antigonus had a mind to appear to exceed herod not only in the courage but in the number of his men he sent pappus one of his companions with an army against samaria
but herod overran the enemys country and demolished five little cities and destroyed two thousand men that were in them and burned their houses and then returned to his camp but his head quarters were at the village called cana six
now a great multitude of jews resorted to him every day both out of jericho and the other parts of the country some were moved so to do out of their hatred to antigonus and some out of regard to the glorious actions herod had done
but others were led on by an unreasonable desire of change so he fell upon them immediately as for pappus and his party they were not terrified either at their number or at their zeal but marched out with great alacrity to fight them
and it came to a close fight now other parts of their army made resistance for a while but herod running the utmost hazard out of the rage he was in at the murder of his brother that he might be avenged on those that had been the authors of it
soon beat those that opposed him and after he had beaten them he always turned his force against those that stood to it still and pursued them all so that a great slaughter was made while some were forced back into that village whence they came out
he also pressed hard upon the hindermost and slew a vast number of them he also fell into the village with the enemy where every house was filled with armed men and the upper rooms were crowded above with soldiers for their defense
and when he had beaten those that were on the outside he pulled the houses to pieces and plucked out those that were within upon many he had the roofs shaken down whereby they perished by heaps and as for those that fled out of the ruins
that the conquerors could not pass along the roads now the enemy could not bear this blow so that when the multitude of them which was gathered together saw that those in the village were slain they dispersed themselves and fled away
upon the confidence of which victory herod had marched immediately to jerusalem
now when at the evening herod had already dismissed his friends to refresh themselves after their fatigue and when he was gone himself while he was still hot in his armor like a common soldier to bathe himself
one of the enemies met him in the face with a sword in his hand and then a second and then a third and after that more of them these were men who had run away out of the battle into the bath in their armor
and they had lain there for some time in great terror and in privacy and when they saw the king they trembled for fear and ran by him in a flight although he was naked and endeavored to get off into the public road
now there was by chance nobody else at hand that might seize upon these men and for herod he was contented to have come to no harm himself so that they all got away in safety eight
but on the next day herod had pappuss head cut off who was the general for antigonus and was slain in the battle and sent it to his brother pheroras by way of punishment for their slain brother for he was the man that slew joseph
and there it was that pompey took the city so he parted the work among the army and demolished the suburbs
acquaintance at the works but he went himself to samaria to take the daughter of alexander the son of aristobulus to wife who had been betrothed to him before as we have already said
and thus he accomplished this by the by during the siege of the city for he had his enemies in great contempt already nine when he had thus married mariamne he
sosius also joined him with a large army both of horsemen and footmen which he sent before him through the midland parts while he marched himself along phoenicia and when the whole army was gotten together
which were eleven regiments of footmen and six thousand horsemen besides the syrian auxiliaries which were no small part of the army they pitched their camp near to the north wall herods dependence was upon the decree of the senate
by which he was made king and sosius relied upon antony who sent the army that was under him to herods assistance chapter eighteen how herod and sosius took jerusalem by force
being the weaker part of them gave it out that as the times were he was the happiest and most religious man who should die first but as to the more bold and hardy men they got together in bodies and fell a robbing others after various manners
and these particularly plundered the places that were about the city and this because there was no food left either for the horses or the men yet some of the warlike men who were used to fight regularly were appointed to defend the city during the siege
now as for the robberies which were committed the king contrived that ambushes should be so laid that they might restrain their excursions and as for the want of provisions he provided that they should be brought to them from great distances
he was also too hard for the jews by the romans skill in the art of war although they were bold to the utmost degree now they durst not come to a plain battle with the romans which was certain death
but through their mines under ground they would appear in the midst of them on the sudden and before they could batter down one wall they built them another in its stead and to sum up all at once
they bore a siege of five months till some of herods chosen men ventured to get upon the wall and fell into the city as did sosiuss centurions after them
and now they first of all seized upon what was about the temple and upon the pouring in of the army there was slaughter of vast multitudes every where by reason of the rage the romans were in at the length of this siege
and by reason that the jews who were about herod earnestly endeavored that none of their adversaries might remain so they were cut to pieces by great multitudes as they were crowded together in narrow streets and in houses or were running away to the temple
nobody could be persuaded to withhold their right hand from slaughter but they slew people of all ages like madmen then it was that antigonus without any regard to his former or to his present fortune came down from the citadel
or let him go free but put him into bonds and kept him in custody three but herods concern at present now he had gotten his enemies under his power
was to restrain the zeal of his foreign auxiliaries for the multitude of the strange people were very eager to see the temple and what was sacred in the holy house itself but the king endeavored to restrain them partly by his exhortations
partly by his threatenings nay partly by force as thinking the victory worse than a defeat to him if any thing that ought not to be seen were seen by them
he also forbade at the same time the spoiling of the city asking sosius in the most earnest manner whether the romans by thus emptying the city of money and men had a mind to leave him king of a desert
and told him that he judged the dominion of the habitable earth too small a compensation for the slaughter of so many citizens
herod made answer that he would give every one of the soldiers a reward out of his own money so he purchased the deliverance of his country and performed his promises to them and made presents after a magnificent manner to each soldier
and proportionably to their commanders and with a most royal bounty to sosius himself whereby nobody went away but in a wealthy condition hereupon sosius dedicated a crown of gold to god and then went away from jerusalem
leading antigonus away in bonds to antony then did the axe bring him to his end
who still had a fond desire of life and some frigid hopes of it to the last but by his cowardly behavior well deserved to die by it four
hereupon king herod distinguished the multitude that was in the city
now cleopatra had put to death all her kindred till no one near her in blood remained alive and after that she fell a slaying those no way related to her so she calumniated the principal men among the syrians to antony
and persuaded him to have them slain that so she might easily gain to be mistress of what they had nay she extended her avaricious humor to the jews and arabians
and secretly labored to have herod and malichus the kings of both those nations slain by his order five now is to these her injunctions to antony he complied in part
and had conducted antony in his expedition against the parthians as far as euphrates she came by apamia and damascus into judea and there did herod pacify her indignation at him by large presents
now it was not long after this that antony was come back from parthia
ministrant ars et natura instillant they use cordials to keep the venom and malignity of the disease from the heart eleven meditation
whence can we take a better argument a clearer demonstration that all the greatness of this world is built upon opinion of others and hath in itself no real being nor power of subsistence
than from the heart of man it is always in action and motion still busy still pretending to do all to furnish all the powers and faculties with all that they have
but if an enemy dare rise up against it it is the soonest endangered the soonest defeated of any part the brain will hold out longer than it and the liver longer than that they will endure a siege
but an unnatural heat a rebellious heat will blow up the heart like a mine in a minute but howsoever since the heart hath the birthright and primogeniture and that it is natures eldest son in us
the part which is first born to life in man and that the other parts as younger brethren and servants in his family have a dependance upon it it is reason that the principal care be had of it
though it be not the strongest part as the eldest is oftentimes not the strongest of the family and since the brain and liver and heart hold not a triumvirate in man a sovereignty equally shed upon them all
must contribute to that as children to their parents as all persons to all kinds of superiors though oftentimes those parents or those superiors
that serve and obey them that are weaker neither doth this obligation fall upon us by second dictates of nature by consequences and conclusions arising out of nature or derived from nature by discourse
as all laws of propriety in that which we possess are of the law of nature which law is to give every one his own and yet in the primary law of nature there was no propriety
no meum et tuum but an universal community overall
which is in the first place to have care of our own preservation to look first to ourselves for therefore doth the physician intermit the present care of brain or liver
because there is a possibility that they may subsist though there be not a present and a particular care had of them but there is no possibility that they can subsist if the heart perish
and this is the reward of the pains of kings sometimes they need the power of law to be obeyed and when they seem to be obeyed voluntarily they who do it do it for their own sakes
o how little a thing is all the greatness of man and through how false glasses doth he make shift to multiply it and magnify it to himself and yet this is also another misery of this king of man
the heart which is also applicable to the kings of this world great men that the venom and poison of every pestilential disease directs itself to the heart affects that pernicious affection
and the malignity of ill men is also directed upon the greatest and the best and not only greatness but goodness loses the vigour of being an antidote or cordial against it
and as the noblest and most generous cordials that nature or art afford or can prepare if they be often taken and made familiar become no cordials nor have any extraordinary operation
so the greatest cordial of the heart patience if it be much exercised exalts the venom and the malignity of the enemy and the more we suffer the more we are insulted upon when god had made this earth of nothing
it was but a little help that he had to make other things of this earth nothing can be nearer nothing than this earth and yet how little of this earth is the greatest man he thinks he treads upon the earth
that all is under his feet and the brain that thinks so is but earth his highest region the flesh that covers that is but earth and even the top of that
is but a bush growing upon that turf of earth how little of the world is the earth and yet that is all that man hath or is how little of a man is the heart and yet it is all by which he is
if before he had a being he could have sense of this misery would buy a being here upon these conditions eleven expostulation my god my god
all that thou askest of me is my heart my son give me thy heart
as long as i have but my heart wilt thou give me an inheritance a filiation any thing for my heart
hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him upon the earth
shall my fear shall my zeal shall my jealousy have leave to say to thee hast thou considered my heart that there is not so perverse a heart upon earth
and wouldst thou have that and shall i be thy son
for giving that the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
thou hast searched since and found all these gradations in the ill of our hearts that every imagination of the thoughts of our hearts is only evil continually
and wouldst thou have my heart o god of all light i know thou knowest all and it is thou
without thee o sovereign goodness i could not know how ill my heart were thou hast declared unto me in thy word that for all this deluge of evil that hath surrounded all hearts
yet thou soughtest and foundest a man after thine own heart
and i can gather out of thy word so good testimony of the hearts of men as to find single hearts docile and apprehensive hearts hearts that can hearts that have learned
wise hearts in one place and in another in a great degree wise perfect hearts straight hearts no perverseness without and clean hearts no foulness within
a heaviness and dejection of spirit upon him i have found these hearts and a worse than these
the last are not hearts to be given to thee what shall i do without that present i cannot be thy son and i have it not to those of the first kind thou givest joyfulness of heart
and i have not that to those of the other kind thou givest faintness of heart
if you return to the lord with all your hearts prepare your hearts unto the lord
it is a returning heart and if thou see it upon the way thou wilt carry it home nay the preparation is thine too this melting this wounding this breaking
this contrition which i have now is thy way to thy end and those discomforts are for all that the earnest of thy spirit in my heart
and i have had some diffidence upon that and thou hast cleared a morning to me again and my heart is alive davids heart smote him when he cut off the skirt from saul
and his heart smote him when he had numbered his people
when i come to number my sins but that blow is not to death because those sins are not to death but my heart lives in thee but yet as long as i remain in this great hospital
this sick this diseaseful world as long as i remain in this leprous house this flesh of mine this heart though thus prepared for thee prepared by thee
will still be subject to the invasion of malign and pestilent vapours but i have my cordials in thy promise when i shall know the plague of my heart and pray unto thee in thy house
and the peace of god which passeth all understandings shall keep my heart and mind through christ jesus
though thou fillest all yet art otherwise in some rooms thereof than in others otherwise in thy church than in my chamber and otherwise in thy sacraments than in my prayers
so though thou be always present and always working in every room of this thy house my body yet i humbly beseech thee to manifest always a more effectual presence in my heart
than in the other offices into the house of thine anointed disloyal persons traitors will come into thy house the church hypocrites and idolators will come into some rooms of this thy house my body
temptations will come infections will come but be my heart thy bedchamber o my god and thither let them not enter job made a covenant with his eyes but not his making of that covenant
but thy dwelling in his heart enabled him to keep that covenant thy son himself had a sadness in his soul to death and he had a reluctation a deprecation of death in the approaches thereof
but he had his cordial too yet not my will but thine be done and as thou hast not delivered us thine adopted sons from these infectious temptations
so neither hast thou delivered us over to them nor withheld thy cordials from us i was baptized in thy cordial water against original sin and i have drunk of thy cordial blood
for my recovery from actual and habitual sin in the other sacrament thou o lord who hast imprinted all medicinal virtues which are in all creatures and hast made even the flesh of vipers to assist in cordials
art able to make this present sickness everlasting health this weakness everlasting strength and this very dejection and faintness of heart a powerful cordial
my god my god why hast thou forsaken me thou didst reach out thy hand to him but not to deliver his sad soul but to receive his holy soul
neither did he longer desire to hold it of thee but to recommend it to thee i see thine hand upon me now o lord and i ask not why it comes what it intends
or bid it meet thee this day in paradise i ask not not in a wish not in a thought infirmity of nature curiosity of mind are temptations that offer
but a silent and absolute obedience to thy will even before i know it is my cordial preserve that to me o my god and that will preserve me to thee
that when thou hast catechised me with affliction here i may take a greater degree and serve thee in a higher place in thy kingdom of joy and glory
chapter sixteen i might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines but i wanted you to see every step by which we came i to agree to whatever marguerite wished
marguerite to be unable to live apart from me it was the day after the evening when she came to see me that i sent her manon lescaut from that time seeing that i could not change my mistresss life i changed my own
i wished above all not to leave myself time to think over the position i had accepted for in spite of myself it was a great distress to me thus my life generally so calm
assumed all at once an appearance of noise and disorder never believe however disinterested the love of a kept woman may be that it will cost one nothing
nothing is so expensive as their caprices flowers boxes at the theatre suppers days in the country which one can never refuse to ones mistress as i have told you i had little money
my father was and still is receveur general at c he has a great reputation there for loyalty thanks to which he was able to find the security which he needed in order to attain this position
i came to paris studied law was called to the bar and like many other young men put my diploma in my pocket and let myself drift as one so easily does in paris
my expenses were very moderate only i used up my years income in eight months and spent the four summer months with my father which practically gave me twelve thousand francs a year and in addition the reputation of a good son
for the rest not a penny of debt this then was my position when i made the acquaintance of marguerite you can well understand that in spite of myself my expenses soon increased
marguerites nature was very capricious and like so many women she never regarded as a serious expense those thousand and one distractions which made up her life so wishing to spend as much time with me as possible
she would write to me in the morning that she would dine with me not at home but at some restaurant in paris or in the country i would call for her and we would dine and go on to the theatre often having supper as well
forgive me if i give you all these details but you will see that they were the cause of what was to follow what i tell you is a true and simple story and i leave to it all the naivete of its details
and all the simplicity of its developments i realized then that as nothing in the world would make me forget my mistress it was needful for me to find some way of meeting the expenses into which she drew me then too
my love for her had so disturbing an influence upon me that every moment i spent away from marguerite was like a year and that i felt the need of consuming these moments in the fire of some sort of passion
as not to know that i was living them i began by borrowing five or six thousand francs on my little capital and with this i took to gambling since gambling houses were destroyed gambling goes on everywhere
formerly when one went to frascati one had the chance of making a fortune one played against money and if one lost there was always the consolation of saying that one might have gained whereas now except in the clubs
where there is still a certain rigour in regard to payments one is almost certain the moment one gains a considerable sum not to receive it you will readily understand why gambling is only likely to be carried on by young people
very much in need of money and not possessing the fortune necessary for supporting the life they lead they gamble then and with this result or else they gain and then those who lose serve to pay for their horses and mistresses
which is very disagreeable debts are contracted acquaintances begun about a green table end by quarrels in which life or honour comes to grief and though one may be an honest man one finds oneself ruined by very honest men
whose only defect is that they have not two hundred thousand francs a year i need not tell you of those who cheat at play
i flung myself into this rapid noisy and volcanic life which had formerly terrified me when i thought of it and which had become for me the necessary complement of my love for marguerite what else could i have done
the nights that i did not spend in the rue dantin if i had spent them alone in my own room i could not have slept jealousy would have kept me awake and inflamed my blood and my thoughts
while gambling gave a new turn to the fever which would otherwise have preyed upon my heart and fixed it upon a passion which laid hold on me in spite of myself until the hour struck when i might go to my mistress then
and by this i knew the violence of my love i left the table without a moments hesitation whether i was winning or losing pitying those whom i left behind because they would not like me find their real happiness in leaving it
for the most of them gambling was a necessity for me it was a remedy free of marguerite i should have been free of gambling thus in the midst of all that i preserved a considerable amount of self possession
i lost only what i was able to pay and gained only what i should have been able to lose for the rest chance was on my side i made no debts and i spent three times as much money as when i did not gamble
it was impossible to resist an existence
as for her she continued to love me as much or even more than ever as i told you i began by being allowed to stay only from midnight to six oclock then i was asked sometimes to a box in the theatre
then she sometimes came to dine with me one morning i did not go till eight and there came a day when i did not go till twelve but sooner than the moral metamorphosis a physical metamorphosis came about in marguerite
i had taken her cure in hand and the poor girl seeing my aim obeyed me in order to prove her gratitude i had succeeded without effort or trouble in almost isolating her from her former habits my doctor
whom i had made her meet had told me that only rest and calm could preserve her health so that in place of supper and sleepless nights i succeeded in substituting a hygienic regime and regular sleep in spite of herself
marguerite got accustomed to this new existence whose salutary effects she already realized she began to spend some of her evenings at home or if the weather was fine she wrapped herself in a shawl put on a veil and we went on foot
like two children in the dim alleys of the champs elysees she would come in tired take a light supper and go to bed after a little music or reading which she had never been used to do the cough
had almost completely disappeared at the end of six weeks the count was entirely given up and only the duke obliged me to conceal my liaison with marguerite and even he was sent away when i was there
under the pretext that she was asleep and had given orders that she was not to be awakened the habit or the need of seeing me which marguerite had now contracted had this good result that it forced me to leave the gaming table just at the moment
when an adroit gambler would have left it settling one thing against another i found myself in possession of some ten thousand francs
the time of the year when i was accustomed to join my father and sister had now arrived and i did not go both of them wrote to me frequently begging me to come to these letters i replied as best i could
always repeating that i was quite well and that i was not in need of money two things which i thought would console my father for my delay in paying him my annual visit just then one fine day in summer
marguerite was awakened by the sunlight pouring into her room and jumping out of bed asked me if i would take her into the country for the whole day
we sent for prudence and all three set off after marguerite had given nanine orders to tell the duke that she had taken advantage of the fine day
prudence was one of those women who seem made on purpose for days in the country with her unchanging good humour and her eternal appetite she never left a dull moment to those whom she was with and was perfectly happy in ordering eggs cherries milk
stewed rabbit and all the rest of the traditional lunch in the country we had now only to decide where we should go it was once more prudence who settled the difficulty do you want to go to the real country she asked yes
armand order an open carriage an hour and a half later we were at widow arnoulds perhaps you know the inn which is a hotel on week days and a tea garden on sundays
there is a magnificent view from the garden which is at the height of an ordinary first floor on the left the aqueduct of marly closes in the horizon
beyond distinct in the sunlight rise little white houses with red roofs and manufactories which at that distance put an admirable finish to the landscape beyond that paris in the mist
as prudence had told us it was the real country and i must add it was a real lunch it is not only out of gratitude for the happiness i owe it
i have travelled a good deal and seen much grander things
the breeze the shining solitude of fields or woods however much one loves a woman whatever confidence one may have in her whatever certainty her past may offer us as to her future one is always more or less jealous
if you have been in love you must have felt the need of isolating from this world the being in whom you would live wholly it seems as if however indifferent she may be to her surroundings the woman whom one loves loses something of her perfume
and of her unity at the contact of men and things as for me i experienced that more than most mine was not an ordinary love i was as much in love as an ordinary creature could be
and who had no concern with us alone with nature in the spring time of the year that annual pardon and shut off from the noise of the city i could hide my love and love without shame or fear
the courtesan disappeared little by little i had by me a young and beautiful woman whom i loved and who loved me and who was called marguerite the past had no more reality and the future no more clouds
the sun shone upon my mistress as it might have shone upon the purest bride we walked together in those charming spots which seemed to have been made on purpose to recall the verses of lamartine or to sing the melodies of scudo
marguerite was dressed in white she leaned on my arm saying over to me again under the starry sky the words she had said to me the day before and far off the world went on its way
add to this that from the place where i was i could see on the shore a charming little house of two stories with a semicircular railing through the railing in front of the house a green lawn smooth as velvet
and behind the house a little wood full of mysterious retreats where the moss must efface each morning the pathway that had been made the day before climbing flowers clung about the doorway of this uninhabited house
mounting as high as the first story i looked at the house so long that i began by thinking of it as mine so perfectly did it embody the dream that i was dreaming i saw marguerite and myself there
by day in the little wood that covered the hillside in the evening seated on the grass and i asked myself if earthly creatures had ever been so happy as we should be what a pretty house marguerite said to me
where asked prudence yonder and marguerite pointed to the house in question ah delicious replied prudence do you like it very much
well tell the duke to take it for you he would do so i am sure ill see about it if you like marguerite looked at me
my dream vanished at the last words of prudence and brought me back to reality so brutally that i was still stunned with the fall
yes an excellent idea i stammered not knowing what i was saying well i will arrange that said marguerite freeing my hand and interpreting my words according to her own desire
let us go and see if it is to let the house was empty and to let for two thousand francs would you be happy here she said to me am i sure of coming here
and for whom else should i bury myself here if not for you well then marguerite let me take it myself you are mad not only is it unnecessary but it would be dangerous
you know perfectly well that i have no right to accept it save from one man let me alone big baby and say nothing that means said prudence that when i have two days free i will come and spend them with you
we left the house and started on our return to paris talking over the new plan
chapter seventeen next day marguerite sent me away very early saying that the duke was coming at an early hour and promising to write to me the moment he went and to make an appointment for the evening
in the course of the day i received this note
be at prudences to night at eight
well it is all settled she said as she entered the house is taken asked prudence yes he agreed at once i did not know the duke but i felt ashamed of deceiving him
but that is not all continued marguerite what else is there i have been seeing about a place for armand to stay in the same house asked prudence laughing
no at point du jour where we had dinner the duke and i
i took it was i right i flung my arms around her neck and kissed her it will be charming she continued you have the key of the little door and i have promised the duke the key of the front door
he has asked me how i loving paris as i do could make up my mind to bury myself in the country i told him that i was ill and that i wanted rest he seemed to have some difficulty in believing me
and we shall have everything perfect the duke is going to look after every single thing ah my dear she added kissing me youre in luck its a millionaire who makes your bed for you
and when shall you move into the house inquired prudence as soon as possible will you take your horses and carriage i shall take the whole house and you can look after my place while i am away
a week later marguerite was settled in her country house and i was installed at point du jour then began an existence which i shall have some difficulty in describing to you
prudence on her side brought down all the people she knew and did the honours of the house as if the house belonged to her the dukes money paid for all that as you may imagine but from time to time prudence came to me
asking for a note for a thousand francs professedly on behalf of marguerite you know i had won some money at gambling i therefore immediately handed over to prudence what she asked for marguerite
and fearing lest she should require more than i possessed i borrowed at paris a sum equal to that which i had already borrowed and paid back i was then once more in possession of some ten thousand francs without reckoning my allowance
however marguerites pleasure in seeing her friends was a little moderated when she saw the expense which that pleasure entailed and especially the necessity she was sometimes in of asking me for money the duke
and having fallen upon a party of fifteen who were still at lunch at an hour when he was prepared to sit down to dinner he had unsuspectingly opened the dining room door and had been greeted by a burst of laughter
marguerite rose from table and joined the duke in the next room where she tried as far as possible to induce him to forget the incident but the old man wounded in his dignity bore her a grudge for it
and could not forgive her he said to her somewhat cruelly that he was tired of paying for the follies of a woman who could not even have him treated with respect under his own roof and he went away in great indignation
since that day he had never been heard of in vain marguerite dismissed her guests changed her way of life the duke was not to be heard of i was the gainer in so
far that my mistress now belonged to me more completely and my dream was at length realized marguerite could not be without me not caring what the result might be she publicly proclaimed our liaison
and i had come to live entirely at her house the servants addressed me officially as their master prudence had strictly sermonized marguerite in regard to her new manner of life but she had replied that she loved me that she could not live without me
and that happen what might she would not sacrifice the pleasure of having me constantly with her adding that those who were not satisfied with this arrangement were free to stay away so much i had heard one day when prudence had said to marguerite
that she had something very important to tell her and i had listened at the door of the room into which they had shut themselves not long after prudence returned again i was at the other end of the garden when she arrived and she did not see me
well said marguerite well i have seen the duke what did he say that he would gladly forgive you in regard to the scene which took place
and that he will never forgive that let marguerite leave the young man he said to me and as in the past i will give her all that she requires if not let her ask nothing more from me
and you replied that i would report his decision to you and i promised him that i would bring you into a more reasonable frame of mind only think my dear child of the position that you are losing
and that armand can never give you he loves you with all his soul but he has no fortune capable of supplying your needs and he will be bound to leave you one day when it will be too late and when the duke will refuse to do any more for you
would you like me to speak to armand marguerite seemed to be thinking for she answered nothing my heart beat violently while i waited for her reply no she answered i will not leave armand
and i will not conceal the fact that i am living with him it is folly no doubt but i love him what would you have me do and then now that he has got accustomed to be always with me
i will do without it but what will you do i dont in the least know prudence was no doubt going to make some reply but i entered suddenly and flung myself at marguerites feet
covering her hands with tears in my joy at being thus loved my life is yours marguerite you need this man no longer am i not here shall i ever leave you and can i ever repay you for the happiness that you give me
no more barriers my marguerite we love what matters all the rest oh yes i love you my armand she murmured putting her two arms around my neck i love you as i never thought i should ever love
and i will say good bye forever to the life for which i now blush you wont ever reproach me for the past tell me tears choked my voice i could only reply by clasping marguerite to my heart well
said she turning to prudence and speaking in a broken voice you can report this scene to the duke and you can add that we have no longer need of him from that day forth the duke was never referred to
marguerite was no longer the same woman that i had known she avoided everything that might recall to me the life which she had been leading when i first met her never did wife or sister surround husband or brother with such loving care as she had for me
any one who had seen us leaving the house to go on the river in the charming little boat which i had bought would never have believed that the woman dressed in white wearing a straw hat
was that marguerite gautier who only four months ago had been the talk of the town for the luxury and scandal of her existence alas we made haste to be happy as if we knew that we were not to be happy long
for two months we had not even been to paris no one came to see us except prudence and julie duprat of whom i have spoken to you
i passed whole days at the feet of my mistress we opened the windows upon the garden and as we watched the summer ripening in its flowers
we breathed together that true life which neither marguerite nor i had ever known before her delight in the smallest things was like that of a child there were days when she ran in the garden like a child of ten
after a butterfly or a dragon fly this courtesan who had cost more money in bouquets than would have kept a whole family in comfort would sometimes sit on the grass for an hour examining the simple flower whose name she bore
it was at this time that she read manon lescaut over and over again i found her several times making notes in the book and she always declared that when a woman loves she can not do as manon did
the duke wrote to her two or three times she recognised the writing and gave me the letters without reading them sometimes the terms of these letters brought tears to my eyes he had imagined that by closing his purse to marguerite
he would bring her back to him but when he had perceived the uselessness of these means he could hold out no longer
as before no matter on what conditions i read these urgent and repeated letters and tore them in pieces without telling marguerite what they contained and without advising her to see the old man again
though i was half inclined to so much did i pity him but i was afraid lest if i so advised her she should think that i wished the duke not merely to come and see her again but to take over the expenses of the house
i feared above all that she might think me capable of shirking the responsibilities of every consequence to which her love for me might lead her it thus came about that the duke receiving no reply ceased to write
missus vickers pale and sick with terror yet sustained by that strange courage of which we have before spoken passed rapidly under the open skylight and prepared to ascend sylvia her romance crushed by too dreadful reality
clung to her mother with one hand and with the other pressed close to her little bosom the english history in her all absorbing fear she had forgotten to lay it down
and shuddering shook her head the men above swore impatiently at the delay and the three hastened on deck whos to command the brig now asked undaunted bates as they came up i am says john rex
and with these brave fellows ill take her round the world the touch of bombast was not out of place it jumped so far with the humour of the convicts that they set up a feeble cheer at which sylvia frowned
frightened as she was the prison bred child was as much astonished at hearing convicts cheer as a fashionable lady would be to hear her footman quote poetry bates however practical and calm took quite another view of the case
the bold project so boldly avowed seemed to him a sheer absurdity the dandy and a crew of nine convicts navigate a brig round the world preposterous why not a man aboard could work a reckoning
his nautical fancy pictured the osprey helplessly rolling on the swell of the southern ocean or hopelessly locked in the ice of the antarctic seas and he dimly guessed at the fate of the deluded ten
even if they got safe to port the chances of final escape were all against them for what account could they give of themselves overpowered by these reflections the honest fellow made one last effort to charm his captors back to their pristine bondage
fools he cried do you know what you are about to do you will never escape give up the brig and i will declare before my god upon the bible that i will say nothing but give all good characters
lesly and another burst into a laugh at this wild proposition but rex who had weighed his chances well beforehand felt the force of the pilots speech and answered seriously its no use talking he said shaking his still handsome head
we have got the brig and we mean to keep her i can navigate her though i am no seaman so you neednt talk further about it mister bates its liberty we require what are you going to do with us asked bates leave you behind batess face blanched
what here yes it dont look a picturesque spot does it and yet ive lived here for some years and he grinned bates was silent the logic of that grin was unanswerable come cried the dandy shaking off his momentary melancholy
look alive there lower away the jolly boat missus vickers go down to your cabin and get anything you want
but i have no wish to leave you without clothes bates listened in a sort of dismal admiration at this courtly convict he could not have spoken like that had life depended on it now my little lady continued rex
run down with your mamma and dont be frightened sylvia flashed burning red at this indignity frightened
frightened let me pass prisoner the whole deck burst into a great laugh at this and poor missus vickers paused trembling for the consequences of the childs temerity to thus taunt the desperate convict who held their lives in his hands seemed sheer madness
in the boldness of the speech however lay its safeguard rex whose politeness was mere bravado was stung to the quick by the reflection upon his courage and the bitter accent with which the child had pronounced the word prisoner
the generic name of convicts made him bite his lips with rage had he had his will he would have struck the little creature to the deck but the hoarse laugh of his companions warned him to forbear there is public opinion even among convicts
and rex dared not vent his passion on so helpless an object as men do in such cases he veiled his anger beneath an affectation of amusement in order to show that he was not moved by the taunt he smiled upon the taunter more graciously than ever
your daughter has her fathers spirit madam said he to missus vickers with a bow bates opened his mouth to listen his ears were not large enough to take in the words of this complimentary convict he began to think that he was the victim of a nightmare he absolutely felt
that john rex was a greater man at that moment than john bates as missus vickers descended the hatchway the boat with frere and the soldiers came within musket range and lesly according to orders fired his musket over their heads
shouting to them to lay to but frere boiling with rage at the manner in which the tables had been turned on him had determined not to resign his lost authority without a struggle disregarding the summons he came straight on with his eyes fixed on the vessel
it was now nearly dark and the figures on the deck were indistinguishable the indignant lieutenant could but guess at the condition of affairs suddenly from out of the darkness a voice hailed him hold water back water
it cried and was then seemingly choked in its owners throat the voice was the property of mister bates standing near the side he had observed rex and fair bring up a great pig of iron erst used as part of the ballast of the brig
and poise it on the rail their intention was but too evident and honest bates like a faithful watch dog barked to warn his master bloodthirsty cheshire caught him by the throat and frere unheeding
ran the boat alongside under the very nose of the revengeful rex the mass of iron fell half in board upon the now stayed boat and gave her sternway with a splintered plank villains cried frere would you swamp us
and a dozen such as ye the brigs ours cant ye see and were your masters now frere stifling an exclamation of rage cried to the bow to hook on but the bow had driven the boat backward and she was already beyond arms length of the brig
looking up he saw cheshires savage face and heard the click of the lock as he cocked his piece the two soldiers exhausted by their long pull made no effort to stay the progress of the boat
the deck of the osprey had become invisible in the darkness frere struck his fist upon the thwart in sheer impotence of rage the scoundrels he said between his teeth theyve mastered us what do they mean to do next
the answer came pat to the question from the dark hull of the brig broke a flash and a report and a musket ball cut the water beside them with a chirping noise between the black indistinct mass which represented the brig
and the glimmering water was visible a white speck which gradually neared them come alongside with ye hailed a voice or it will be the worse for ye they want to murder us says frere give way men
its no use mister frere said the man nearest him we can do no good now and they wont hurt us i dare say you dogs you are in league with them bursts out frere purple with indignation do you mutiny
come come sir returned the soldier sulkily this aint the time to bully and as for mutiny why one mans about as good as another just now this speech from the lips of a man who
but a few minutes before would have risked his life to obey orders of his officer did more than an hours reasoning to convince maurice frere of the hopelessness of resistance his authority
he was now no more than anyone else indeed he was less than many for those who held the firearms were the ruling powers with a groan he resigned himself to his fate and looking at the sleeve of the undress uniform he wore
it seemed to him that virtue had gone out of it when they reached the brig they found that the jolly boat had been lowered and laid alongside in her were eleven persons bates with forehead gashed and hands bound the stunned grimes
russen and fair pulling lyon riley cheshire and lesly with muskets and john rex in the stern sheets
and a loaded musket across his knees the white object which had been seen by the men in the whale boat was a large white shawl which wrapped missus vickers and sylvia
he had feared that the child was injured by the direction of rex the whale boat was brought alongside the jolly boat and cheshire and lesly boarded her
frere attempted to resist this indignity but cheshire clapping his musket to his ear swore he would blow out his brains if he uttered another syllable frere catching the malignant eye of john rex
remembered how easily a twitch of the finger would pay off old scores and was silent step in here sir if you please said rex with polite irony i am sorry to be compelled to tie you but i must consult my own safety as well as your convenience
fell pinioned as he was he could not rise without assistance and russen pulled him roughly to his feet with a coarse laugh in his present frame of mind that laugh galled him worse than his bonds
poor missus vickers with a womans quick instinct saw this and even amid her own trouble found leisure to console him the wretches she said under her breath as frere was flung down beside her to subject you to such indignity
sylvia said nothing and seemed to shrink from the lieutenant perhaps in her childish fancy she had pictured him as coming to her rescue
and clad in dazzling mail or at the very least as a muscular hero who would settle affairs out of hand by sheer personal prowess if she had entertained any such notion the reality must have struck coldly upon her senses
mister frere purple clumsy and bound was not at all heroic now my lads says rex who seemed to have endured the cast off authority of frere we give you your choice stay at hells gates or come with us
the soldiers paused irresolute to join the mutineers meant a certainty of hard work with a chance of ultimate hanging yet to stay with the prisoners was as far as they could see to incur the inevitable fate of starvation on a barren coast
dimly caught the meaning of the sentence
go with him ye beggars said he and leave us honest men oh yell get a tying up for this the phrase tying up brought with it recollection of the worst portion of military discipline the cat
and revived in the minds of the pair already disposed to break the yoke that sat so heavily upon them a train of dismal memories the life of a soldier on a convict station was at that time a hard one he was often stinted in rations
and of necessity deprived of all rational recreation while punishment for offences was prompt and severe the companies drafted to the penal settlements were not composed of the best material and the pair had good precedent for the course they were about to take
which is it to be well go with you says the man who had pulled the stroke in the whale boat spitting into the water with averted face upon which utterance the convicts burst into joyous oaths and the pair were received with much hand shaking
then rex with lyon and riley as a guard got into the whale boat and having loosed the two prisoners from their bonds ordered them to take the place of russen and fair the whale boat was manned by the seven mutineers
rex steering fair russen and the two recruits pulling and the other four standing up with their muskets levelled at the jolly boat their long slavery had begotten such a dread of authority in these men that they feared it even when it was bound and menaced by four muskets
keep your distance shouted cheshire as frere and bates in obedience to orders began to pull the jolly boat towards the shore and in this fashion was the dismal little party conveyed to the mainland it was night when they reached it
but the clear sky began to thrill with a late moon as yet unrisen and the waves breaking gently upon the beach glimmered with a radiance born of their own motion frere and bates jumping ashore helped out missus vickers sylvia and the wounded grimes
this being done under the muzzles of the muskets rex commanded that bates and frere should push the jolly boat as far as they could from the shore and riley catching her by a boat hook as she came towards them she was taken in tow
three cheers for old england and liberty upon which a great shout went up echoed by the grim hills which had witnessed so many miseries to the wretched five this exultant mirth sounded like a knell of death
great god cried bates running up to his knees in water after the departing boats would you leave us here to starve
chapter twenty five the flight gabbett guided by the crow had determined to beach the captured boat on the southern point of cape surville it will be seen by those who have followed the description of the topography of colonel arthurs penitentiary
that nothing but the desperate nature of the attempt could have justified so desperate a measure the perpendicular cliffs seemed to render such an attempt certain destruction but vetch who had been employed in building the pier at the neck
knew that on the southern point of the promontory was a strip of beach upon which the company might by good fortune land in safety with something of the decision of his leader rex the crow determined at once that in their desperate plight this was the only measure
and setting his teeth as he seized the oar that served as a rudder he put the boats head straight for the huge rock that formed the northern horn of pirates bay save for the faint phosphorescent radiance of the foaming waves the darkness was intense
and burgess for some minutes pulled almost at random in pursuit the same tremendous flash of lightning which had saved the life of mc nab by causing rex to miss his aim showed to the commandant the whale boat balanced on the summit of an enormous wave
and apparently about to be flung against the wall of rock which magnified in the flash seemed frightfully near to them the next instant burgess himself his boat lifted by the swiftly advancing billow
saw a wild waste of raging seas scooped into abysmal troughs in which the bulk of a leviathan might wallow at the bottom of one of these valleys of water lay the mutineers boat looking with its outspread oars like some six legged insect
floating in a pool of ink the great cliff whose every scar and crag was as distinct as though its huge bulk was but a yard distant seemed to shoot out from its base towards the struggling insect a broad flat straw that was a strip of dry land
the next instant the rushing water carrying the six legged atom with it creamed up over this strip of beach
appeared to stoop down over the ocean and as it stooped the billow rolled onwards the boat glided down into the depths and the whole phantasmagoria was swallowed up in the tumultuous darkness of the tempest burgess his hair bristling with terror
shouted to put the boat about but he might with as much reason have shouted at an avalanche the wind blew his voice away and emptied it violently into the air a snarling billow jerked the oar from his hand
despite the desperate efforts of the soldiers the boat was whirled up the mountain of water like a leaf on a water spout and a second flash of lightning showed them what seemed a group of dolls struggling in the surf and a walnut shell bottom upwards was driven
by the recoil of the waves towards them for an instant all thought that they must share the fate which had overtaken the unlucky convicts but burgess succeeded in trimming the boat and awed by the peril he had so narrowly escaped gave the order to return
as the men set the boats head to the welcome line of lights that marked the neck a black spot balanced upon a black line was swept under their stern and carried out to sea as it passed them this black spot emitted a cry
and they knew that it was one of the shattered boats crew clinging to an oar he was the only one of em alive said burgess bandaging his sprained wrist two hours afterwards at the neck and hes food for the fishes by this time he was mistaken however
fate had in reserve for the crew of villains a less merciful death than that of drowning aided by the lightning and that wonderful good luck which urges villainy to its destruction vetch beached the boat and the party bruised and bleeding
reached the upper portion of the shore in safety of all this number only cox was lost he was pulling stroke oar and being something of a laggard stood in the way of the crow who seeing the importance of haste in preserving his own skin plucked the man backwards by the collar
and passed over his sprawling body to the shore cox grasping at anything to save himself clutched an oar and the next moment found himself borne out with the overturned whale boat by the under tow he was drifted past his only hope of rescue the guard boat
with a velocity that forbade all attempts at rescue and almost before the poor scoundrel had time to realize his condition he was in the best possible way of escaping the hanging that his comrades had so often humorously prophesied for him
being a strong and vigorous villain however he clung tenaciously to his oar and even unbuckling his leather belt passed it round the slip of wood that was his salvation girding himself to it as firmly as he was able
in this condition plus a swoon from exhaustion he was descried by the helmsman of the pretty mary a few miles from cape surville at daylight next morning
lowered a boat and picked him up nearly bisected by the belt gorged with salt water frozen with cold and having two ribs broken the victim of vetchs murderous quickness retained sufficient life to survive blunts remedies for nearly two hours
during that time he stated that his name was cox that he had escaped from port arthur with eight others that john rex was the leader of the expedition that the others were all drowned and that he believed john rex had been retaken having placed blunt in possession of these particulars
he further said that it pricked him to breathe cursed jemmy vetch the settlement and the sea and so impenitently died blunt smoked three pipes and then altered the course of the pretty mary two points to the eastward and ran for the coast
it was possible that the man for whom he was searching had not been retaken and was even now awaiting his arrival it was clearly his duty hearing of the planned escape having been actually attempted not to give up the expedition while hope remained
the pretty mary hugging the coast as closely as she dared crawled in the thin breeze all day and saw nothing it would be madness to land at cape surville for the whole station would be on the alert so blunt as night was falling
stood off a little across the mouth of pirates bay he was walking the deck groaning at the folly of the expedition when a strange appearance on the southern horn of the bay made him come to a sudden halt there was a furnace blazing in the bowels of the mountain
blunt rubbed his eyes and stared he looked at the man at the helm do you see anything yonder jem jem a sydney man who had never been round that coast before briefly remarked lighthouse
blunt stumped into the cabin and got out his charts no lighthouse was laid down there only a mark like an anchor and a note remarkable hole at this point a remarkable hole indeed
a remarkable lime kiln would have been more to the purpose blunt called up his mate william staples a fellow whom sarah purfoys gold had bought body and soul william staples looked at the waxing and waning glow for a while
and then said in tones trembling with greed its a fire lie to and lower away the jolly boat old man thats our bird for a thousand pounds the pretty mary shortened sail and blunt and staples got into the jolly boat
goin a hoysterin sir said one of the crew with a grin as blunt threw a bundle into the stern sheets staples thrust his tongue into his cheek the object of the voyage was now pretty well understood among the carefully picked crew
blunt had not chosen men who were likely to betray him though for that matter rex had suggested a precaution which rendered betrayal almost impossible
clothes returned blunt we cant bring him off if it is him in his canaries he puts on these duds dye see sinks her majestys livery and comes aboard a shipwrecked mariner thats well thought of whose notions that
the madams ill be bound ay shes a knowing one and the sinister laughter of the pair floated across the violet water go easy man said blunt as they neared the shore theyre all awake at eaglehawk and if those cursed dogs give tongue
therell be a boat out in a twinkling its lucky the winds off shore staples lay on his oar and listened the night was moonless and the ship had already disappeared from view they were approaching the promontory from the south east
and this isthmus of the guarded neck was hidden by the outlying cliff in the south western angle of this cliff about midway between the summit and the sea was an arch which vomited a red and flickering light that faintly shone upon the sea in the track of the boat
the light was lambent and uncertain now sinking almost into insignificance and now leaping up with a fierceness that caused a deep glow to throb in the very heart of the mountain sometimes a black figure would pass across this gigantic furnace mouth
stooping and rising as though feeding the fire one might have imagined that a door in vulcans smithy
and that the old hero was forging arms for a demigod blunt turned pale its no mortal he whispered lets go back and what will madam say returned dare devil will staples who would have plunged into mount erebus had he been paid for it
a beautiful pebbly beach extended almost to the waters edge even at low tide there was a grassy level spit a background of evergreen giant fir timber
and such fuel for the camp fire broken limbs with just enough pitch to make a cheerful blaze and yet body enough to last well
glad the journey had been interrupted oliver was the carpenter of the party the tent builder wood getter and general roustabout while i the junior was chief cook and bottle washer
an encampment of indians being near a party of them soon visited our camp and began making signs for trade
said one of the matrons of the party what does she say oliver im blessed if i know but it looks as if she wanted to sell some clams after considerable dickering with signs and gestures and words many times repeated
we were able to impart the information that we wanted
soon we came in sight of a fleet of seven vessels lying at anchor in a large bay several miles in extent the sight of those seven vessels lying in the offing made a profound impression upon our minds
we had never before seen so many ships at one place curiously enough among them was the good bark mary melville with her gruff mate and big hearted master captain barston
upon the eastern slope of the shores of this bay lay the two towns port steilacoom and steilacoom city both established in eighteen fifty one a far larger trade centered here than at any other point on puget sound
and we decided on a halt to make ourselves acquainted with the surroundings a mile and a half from the shore we found also fort steilacoom it was simply the camp of a company of united states soldiers quartered in wooden shells of houses
and log cabins intense rivalry ran between the two towns upper and lower steilacoom at this time as a result things were booming
we were sorely tempted to accept the flattering offer of four dollars a day for common labor in a timber camp but concluded not to be swerved from the search for a new homesite during this visit we began seeing indians in considerable numbers
they seemed to be a listless lot with no thought for the future or even for the immediate present the indians in those days seemed to work or play by spurts and spells here and there we saw a family
but as a class they seemed to me the laziest set of people on earth that opinion was materially modified later as i became better acquainted with their habits i have found just as industrious people both men and women
among the indians as among the whites the workers it may be said are less numerous among the men the women are all industrious should we camp here and spy out the land or should we go forward and see what lay before us
after a sober second thought we realized that we had nothing to trade but labor and we had not come as far as this to be laborers for hire we had come to find a place to make a farm
and a farm we were going to have again we set about searching for claims and the more we searched the less we liked the look of things finally on the fourth day after a long wearisome tramp we cast off at high tide
and in a dead calm to continue our cruise oliver soon dropped into a comfortable afternoon nap leaving me in full command as the sun shone warm and the tide was taking us rapidly in the direction we wanted to go
why shouldnt i doze a little too even if we did miss some of the sightseeing i was aroused from my nap by olivers exclaiming what is that then half to himself as i live its a deer swimming out here in the bay
it surely cant be i responded three quarters asleep thats what it is he asserted we were wide awake now and gave chase very soon we caught up with the animal and succeeded in throwing a rope over its horns
by this time we had drifted into the narrows and we soon found we had something more important to do than to tow a deer
a perpendicular bluff rose from the highwater mark leaving no place for camp fire or bed
and with contending forces of currents and counter currents yet all moving in a general direction it was our first introduction to a genuine tide rip the waters boiled as if in a veritable caldron swelling up here and there
give me the salmon caught by trolling in early summer in the deep waters of puget sound the fish so fat that the excess of oil must be turned out of the pan while cooking
the following day we could see mt rainier with its reflection in the placid waters of the bay theodore winthrop the observant traveler who came into these same waters a few months later and wrote of it as mt tacoma
described it as a giant mountain dome of snow seeming to fill the aerial spaces as the image displaced the blue deeps of tranquil water a wondrous sight it was and is whatever the name next day we entered the mouth of the puyallup
and that the current was very strong we secured the services of an indian and his canoe to help us up the river and left our boat at the indians camp near the mouth it took a tugging of two days to go six miles
and drag our canoe around the drifts it was a story of constant toil with consequent discouragement not ending until we camped
an indian trail led up the river from
but wagon roads there were none and whether a feasible route for one could be found only time and labor could determine we retraced our steps and in the evening landed again at the mouth of the river after a severe days toil we were in no cheerful mood
oliver did not sing as usual while preparing for camp neither did i have much to say but i fell to work mechanically preparing the much needed meal we ate in silence and then went to sleep
over hundreds of miles of unoccupied prairie land as rich as anything that ever lay out of doors on our way from indiana to oregon in search of land on which to make a home here at what we might call the end of our rope
we had found the land but with conditions that seemed almost too adverse to overcome it was a discouraging outlook even if there had been roads such timber it seemed an appalling undertaking to clear this land
when we fell asleep that night it was without visions of new found wealth and yet later i did tackle a quarter section of that heaviest timber land and never let up until the last tree log stump and root had disappeared
though of course not all cleared off by my own hands if we could have known what was coming four months later we would have remained in spite of our discouragement
pass trail into washington they located in a body over nearly the whole valley and before the year was ended had made a rough wagon road out to the prairies
lest some smart fellow should up and say i was drawing on my imagination i am not when we had broken camp and were sailing along we heard a dull sound like that often heard
it extended as far as we could see in the direction we were going the sound increased and became like the roar of a heavy fall of rain or hail on water and we became aware that it was a vast school of fish moving south
while millions were seemingly dancing on the surface of the water or leaping in the air we could feel the fish striking against the boat in such vast numbers that they fairly moved it the leap in the air was so high
one would drop into the boat we soon discovered some indians following the school
with an improvised net we too soon obtained all we wanted when we began to go on we were embarrassed by the mass of fish moving in the water as far as we could see there was no end to the school ahead of us but we finally got clear of the moving mass
and reached the island shore in safety only to become weather bound in the wilds once more this camp did not prove so dreary as the last one although it was more exposed to the swell of the big waters
and the sweep of the wind to the north we had a view of thirty miles or more to where horizon and water blended leaving it doubtful whether land was in sight or not as we afterwards ascertained we could see the famous san juan island
later the bone of contention between our government and great britain when the northern boundary of the united states was settled port townsend lay
the exact location of the town like the lost hunters we knew where we were but we didnt know where any place else was not lost ourselves the world was lost from us three ships passed us while we were at this camp
a mere speck and growing to a full fledged deep sea vessel with all sails set scudding before the wind the other two were gracefully beating their way out
with the beautiful open and comparatively level plateau in the background and two or three vessels at anchor in the foreground made a picture of a perfect city site
many shacks and camps at first mistaken for the white mens houses were found to be occupied by natives they were a drunken rascally rabble spending their gains from the sale of fish and oil
in a debauch that would last as long as their money held out this seemed to be a more stalwart race of indians than those to the south doubtless from the buffeting received in the larger waters they would often go out even to the open sea
on their fishing excursions in canoes manned by thirty men or more after spending two or three days exploring the country we turned back to the bay where lay the seven ships we had seen near steilacoom we remembered the timber camps
the bustle and stir of the little new village and the activity that we saw there greater than anywhere else on the waters of the sound most of all my thoughts would go on to the little cabin on the columbia river three days sufficed to land
us back in the bay we sought but the ships were gone not a sailing craft of any kind was in sight of the little town
can i get home tonight i asked myself it was an afternoon of the last week of june in eighteen fifty three and the sun was yet high i was well up the left bank of the cowlitz river how far i could not tell
for there were no milestones on the crooked half obstructed trail leading downstream at best it would be a race with the sun but the days were long and the twilight was long
i wore a heavy woolen shirt a slouch hat and worn shoes both hat and shoes gave ample ventilation socks i had none neither had i suspenders an improvised belt
taking their place i was dressed for the race and was eager for the trial at olympia i had parted with my brother
while i was to go home for the wife and baby to remove them to our new home i did not particularly mind the camping but i did not fancy the idea of lying out so near home if by extra exertion i could reach the cabin before night
we never thought of catching cold from lying on the ground or on cedar boughs or from getting a good drenching after all the cabin could not be reached as the trail could not be followed at night
slackening pace at nightfall to cool my system gradually i finally made my camp and slept as soundly as if on a bed of down my consolation was that the night was short and i could see to travel by three oclock
i do not look upon those years of camp and cabin life as years of hardship to be sure our food was plain as well as our dress our hours of labor were long and the labor itself was frequently severe the pioneers appeared rough and uncouth
we never watched for the sun to go down
or for the boss to quicken our steps the days were always too short and interest in our work was always unabated the cabin could not be seen until the trail came quite near it when i caught sight of a curl of smoke i knew i was almost there then i saw the cabin
and a little lady in almost bloomer dress milking the cow she never finished milking that cow nor did she ever milk any cow when her husband was at home there were so many things to talk about that we could scarcely tell where to begin or when to stop
much of the conversation naturally centered on the question of our moving to a new home why at olympia eggs were a dollar a dozen i saw them selling at that the butter you have there would bring you a dollar a pound as fast as you could weigh it out
i saw stuff they called butter sell for that potatoes are selling for three dollars a bushel and onions at four everything the farmer raises sells high who buys oh almost everybody has to buy
where do they get the money everybody seems to have money some take it there with them men working in the timber camps get four dollars a day and their board at one place they paid four dollars a cord for wood to ship to san francisco
and a man can sell all the shingles he can make at four dollars a thousand i was offered five cents a foot for piles if we had buck and dandy over there we could make twenty dollars a day
off the government land of course all help themselves to what they want then there are the fish and the clams and oysters and but what about the land for the claim that question was a stumper the little wife never lost sight of that bargain made before we were married
now i found myself praising a country for the agricultural qualities of which i could not say much but if we could sell produce higher might we not well lower our standard of an ideal farm the claim i had taken was described with a touch of apology
however we decided to move and began to prepare for the journey the wife baby bedding ox yoke and log chain were sent up the cowlitz in a canoe buck and dandy and i took the trail
on this occasion i was ill prepared for a cool night camp having neither blanket nor coat i had expected to reach hard breads hotel where the people in the canoe would stop overnight but i could not make it so again i lay out on the trail
hard breads an odd name for a hotel was so called because the old widower that kept the place fed his patrons on hardtack three times a day i found that my wife had not fared any better than i had on the trail and in fact
not so well the floor of the cabin that is the hotel was a great deal harder than the sand spit where i had passed the night i had plenty of pure fresh air while she in a closed cabin
and in the same room with many others had neither fresh air nor freedom from creeping things that make life miserable with her shoes for a pillow a shawl for covering small wonder that she reported i did not sleep a wink last night
we soon arrived at the cowlitz landing the end of the canoe journey striking the tent that had served us so well on the plains and making a cheerful camp fire we speedily forgot the hard experiences of the trail
fifty miles more of travel lay before us and such a road however we had one consolation it would be worse in winter than at that time
our cows were gone given for provender to save the lives of the oxen during the deep december snow so when we took account of stock we had the baby buck and dandy a tent an ox yoke and chain enough clothing and bedding to keep us comfortable
a very little food and no money the money had all been expended on the canoe passage should we pack the oxen and walk
this last proposition was the most attractive and so next morning driving my oxen before me and leaving wife and baby to take care of the camp
stranger though i was to say yes you can have two if you need them jackson had settled there eight years before
the dread disease had terrors then that it does not now possess could it be possible my folks had been taken sick
it appeared that i had scarcely got out of sight on my trip back with the oxen before one of those royal pioneer matrons had come to the camp she pleaded and insisted and finally almost frightened the little wife into going with her
and sharing her house which was near by
finding that the boat and provisions had been taken and seeing smoke in the bight
chapter seventeen finding my people on leaving my newly found friends i faced a discouraging prospect the start for the high arid table lands bordering the yakima valley cut me loose from all communication
no more immigrants were met until i reached the main traveled route beyond the columbia river the road lay through a forbidding sage plain or rather an undulating country covered by shifting sands
as the sun rose the heat became intolerable the dust in places brought vivid memories of the trip across the plains
to catch a glimpse of the expected train
and compelled me to leave the road and descend into the valley for water
that lasted until during the afternoon when i found water on the trail tethering my pony for his much needed dinner i opened my sack of hard bread to count the contents my store was half gone i lay down in the shade of a small tree
near the spring to take an afternoon nap rousing before sundown refreshed bobby and i took the trail with new courage when night came i could not find it in my heart to camp the cool of the evening invigorated the pony and we pushed on
finding that the road could be followed though but dimly seen i kept on the trail until a late hour when i unsaddled and hobbled the pony the saddle blanket was brought into use and i was soon off in dreamland forgetting all about the dust the trail or the morrow
to make matters worse his hobbles had become loosened giving him free use of all his feet and he was in no mood to take the trail again coaxing was of no avail driving would do no good
i followed him around about over the plain and through the sage brush at a rapid gait finally he slackened pace and i again became master
all this roaming over the plain at bobbys heels but i happened to take the right course when the trail was found there was the saddle to look for and this was located with some difficulty
a few hundred yards of travel brought uneasiness as it was evident that we were not on the regular trail not knowing but this was some cut off i went on until the columbia river bluff was reached and the great river was in sight
half a mile distant and several hundred feet lower taking a trail down the bluff that seemed more promising than the wagon tracks i began to search for the road at the foot of the bluff
only to find every semblance of a road gone i lost more than a half days precious time and again was thrown into anxiety lest i had missed the long sought train the next incident that i remember vividly was my attempt to cross the columbia
just below the mouth of the snake river i had seen but few indians on the whole trip and in fact the camp i found there on the bank of the great river was the first i distinctly remember coming upon i could not induce the indians to cross me over
they seemed surly and unfriendly their behavior was so in contrast to that of the indians on the sound that i could not help wondering what it meant no one to my knowledge lost his life at the hands of the indians that season
until i was hoarse from the violent effort finally while sitting there wondering what to do i spied a blue smoke arising from a cabin on the other side soon after i saw a man he immediately responded to my renewed efforts to attract attention
the trouble had been that the people were all asleep while i was there in the early morning expending my breath for nothing the man was shirley ensign of olympia who had established a ferry across the columbia river and had lingered to set over belated immigrants if any should come along
and had met my people they were camped some thirty miles away he thought
but i could not wait there for them
determined to reach camp that night if i could possibly do so
dusk came on and still no signs then i spied some cattle grazing on the upland and soon came upon the camp in a ravine that had shut it from view rejoicing and outbursts of grief followed i inquired for my mother the first thing
she was not there months before she had been buried in the sands of the platte valley my younger brother also lay buried on the plains near independence rock
when we came to consider how the party should proceed i advised the over mountain trip but i cautioned them to expect some snow and much hard work how long will it take they asked about three weeks this brought disappointment
they had thought they were about through with the journey you came to stay with us didnt you i want to but what about my wife and the two babies at the island father said some one must go and look after them so oliver was sent ahead
while i was to take his place and help the immigrants through the natchess pass in our train were fifty or more head of stock seven wagons and seventeen people we made the trip across the divide in twenty two days without serious mishap or loss
that beset our way at every step every man literally put his shoulder to the wheel we were compelled often to take hold of the wheels to boost the wagons over the logs or to ease them down steep places
one man to each wagon to drive four to act as wheelmen father and the women on foot or horseback to drive the stock god bless the women folks of the plains nobler braver more uncomplaining souls were never known
i have often thought that some one ought to write a just tribute to their valor and patience a book of their heroic deeds one day we encountered a newly fallen tree cocked up on its own upturned roots four feet from the ground go around it we could not
to cut it out with our dulled flimsy saw seemed an endless task dig down boys said father and in short order every available shovel was out of the wagons very soon the way was open fully four feet deep and oxen and wagons passed under the obstruction
do you say that we endured great hardships that depends upon the point of view as to this return trip i can truly say for myself that it was not one of hardship i enjoyed overcoming the difficulties and so did the greater number of the company
but better food was obtainable and the goal was near at hand it was a positive pleasure therefore to pass over the miles one by one
when our little train at last emerged from the forests and came out into the nisqually plains
so marked was the contrast hundreds of cattle sheep and horses were quietly grazing scattered over the landscape as far as one could see
the preceding pages have outlined the career of the second connecticut heavy artillery and have narrated some of the more memorable events of its history enough has been told of what it did to furnish grounds for deducing what it was
but to deal with the regiment on the personal side is hardly possible within the limits of such a sketch as this though it is a matter that cannot be entirely passed by
made up the organization whose not uneventful existence has been described that they were better men or worse braver men or more patriotic than their descendants and successors would prove under similar conditions
or than the hundreds of thousands of their contemporaries who devoted themselves to the same service is not to be believed yet to have passed through such experiences as have been recounted which became for them for a time the commonplaces of every day life
is enough to place them apart from ordinary men in the eyes of our peace knowing generation in fact to have passed the tests of so fierce a course of education gives them a title to a place thus apart the university man of to day
as the burden of the baccalaureate sermons so frequently testifies is consigned to a special place of responsibility in life because of his training these men surely earned one of special honor by reason of theirs which was too
not like the other preparation alone but also fulfilment the realization of how typical it all was of that generation and that time brings the clearest understanding of the real scope of the civil war
a number of the officers and men were college graduates when they enlisted and others gained degrees after the war ended the list which follows is however necessarily incomplete in fact an absolutely correct list is no doubt hopelessly impossible
and was enlisted as captain of a company which he had been active in recruiting lieutenant colonel nathaniel smith of woodbury entered the yale law school in the class of eighteen fifty three but did not graduate
ill health forced him to relinquish his commission early in eighteen sixty four and until his death in eighteen seventy seven he was a leading citizen of the county judge augustus h fenn major and brevet colonel
came back from the war having lost an arm at cedar creek to take a course in the law school at harvard and yale made him a master of arts in eighteen eighty nine his prominence for many years in public life and as judge in the highest courts in the state is well known
at the time of his death in eighteen ninety seven he was a lecturer in the yale law school and member of the supreme court of errors
captain and brevet major was a graduate of williams in the class of eighteen fifty seven he was pastor of the congregational church at east canaan when the regiment was organized and was one of its recruiting officers adjutant theodore f vaill
the historian of the regiment was a student before the war at union college but did not graduate captain george s williams of new milford was a member of the class of eighteen fifty two at yale for a time
and received a degree from trinity in eighteen fifty five surgeon henry plumb and assistant surgeons robert g hazzard and john w lawton were all graduates of the yale medical school in the classes of eighteen sixty one
and after the war was for some years rector of saint johns church in salisbury he was later connected with a church college in missouri where he died in eighteen ninety eight
studied after the war at the berkeley divinity school and has been for many years rector of saint johns church in bridgeport lieutenant and brevet captain lewis w munger
sergeant theodore c glazier was a graduate of trinity in the class of eighteen sixty and was a tutor there when he enlisted he was later made colonel of a colored regiment and served with credit in that capacity
corporal edward c hopson a graduate of trinity in eighteen sixty four was killed at cedar creek sergeant garwood r merwin who had been a member of the class of eighteen sixty four at yale
colonel mackenzie graduated at west point in eighteen sixty two but he was never a resident of the county or of connecticut and his only connection with either was through his commission from governor buckingham
there are not a few other names upon the rolls of the regiment which upon more thorough investigation than has been possible in the present case would certainly be added to the list
a complete history of the organization would also give a large place to the association of its veterans formed shortly after the war whose frequent gatherings have more than a superficial likeness to the reunions of college classes
memorable among these meetings was the one held on october twenty first eighteen ninety six the occasion being the dedication of the regiments monument in the national cemetery at arlington
as a whole the regiment was a body thoroughly representative not only of the army of which it was a fraction an army as has been often said unlike any other the world has known but also of the population from which it was drawn
it was made up of men of almost all conditions of life and of widely different ages though naturally with young men in a large majority of mechanics from the housatonic and naugatuck valleys and farmers boys from the hills of men of education and men of none
though the large addition to its numbers which the increase in size necessitated made it perhaps somewhat less homogeneous than at first it did not greatly alter its essential characteristics
the records kept by the association referred to furnish suggestive revelations as to the various elements that composed it the names of men of every sort and kind are found upon the rolls there were veterans of the mexican war
there were refugees from the revolutionary uprisings in europe of eighteen forty eight there were some who had served under compulsion in the armies of the south there were men whose obviously fictitious names concealed stories which could be guessed to be extraordinary
there were names which have been for years among the best known and most honored in this state and there were those of outcasts and wrecks a large part of these men came back after their service ended to resume the peaceful life of citizenship
and every town among us has known some of them ever since among its leading figures while some in quarters far distant have also attained to honors and responsibilities as the records show
how i hate the man who talks about the brute creation with an ugly emphasis on brute as for me i am proud of my close kinship with other animals
i take a jealous pride in my simian ancestry i like to think that i was once a magnificent hairy fellow living in the trees and that my frame has come down through geological time via sea jelly and worms
and amphioxus fish dinosaurs and apes who would exchange these for the pallid couple in the garden of eden w n p barbellion
last sunday potter took me out driving along upper broadway where those long rows of tall new apartment houses were built a few years ago it was a mild afternoon and great crowds of people were out
sunday afternoon crowds they were not going anywhere they were just strolling up and down staring at each other and talking there were thousands and thousands of them
i turned and asked why what about them i wasnt sure whether he had an idea or a headache other creatures dont do it he replied with a discouraged expression
are any other beings ever found in such masses but vermin aimless staring vacant minded look at them
i can get no sense whatever of individual worth or of value in men as a race when i see them like this it makes one almost despair of civilization i thought this over for awhile
and yet at other times i too feel like a spectator an alien but even then i had never felt so alien or despairing as potter lets remember i said its a simian civilization
potter was staring disgustedly at some vaudeville sign boards yes i said those for example are distinctively simian why should you feel disappointment at something inevitable and i went on to argue that it wasnt as though we were descended from
eagles for instance instead of broadly speaking from ape like or monkeyish beings being of simian stock we had simian traits our development naturally bore the marks of our origin
what could you expect two if we had been made directly from clay the way it says in the bible and had therefore inherited no intermediate characteristics
if a god or some principle of growth had gone that way to work with us he or it might have molded us in much more splendid forms but considering our simian descent it has done very well
the only people who are disappointed in us are those who still believe that clay story or who unconsciously still let it color their thinking there certainly seems to be a power at work in the world
by virtue of which every living thing grows and develops and it tends toward splendor seeds become trees and weak little nations grow great but the push or the force that is doing this the yeast as it were
has to work in and on certain definite kinds of material because this yeast is in us there may be great and undreamed of possibilities awaiting mankind but because of our line of descent
there are also queer limitations three in those distant invisible epochs before men existed before even the proud missing link strutted around through the woods
little realizing how we his greatgrandsons would smile wryly at him much as our own descendants may shudder at us ages hence the various animals were desperately competing for power they couldnt or didnt live as equals
certain groups sought the headship many strange forgotten dynasties rose met defiance and fell in the end it was our ancestors who won and became simian kings and bequeathed a whole planet to us
and kept us in cages or show us for sport in the forest while they ruled the world so potter and i developing this train of thought began to imagine we had lived many ages ago and somehow or other had alighted here from some older planet
familiar with the ways of evolution elsewhere in the universe we naturally should have wondered what course it would take on this earth even in this out of the way corner of the cosmos we might have reflected and on this tiny star
it may be of interest to consider the trend of events we should have tried to appraise the different species as they wandered around each with its own set of good and bad characteristics which group wed have wondered would ever contrive to rule all the rest
and how great a development could they attain to thereafter
we might first have considered the lemurs or apes they had hands aesthetically viewed the poor simians were simply grotesque but travelers who knew other planets might have known what beauty may spring from an uncouth beginning in this magic universe
still those frowsy unlovely hordes of apes and monkeys were so completely lacking in signs of kingship they were so flighty too in their ways and had so little purpose and so much love for absurd and idle chatter
they are not easily left behind even after long stages and they form a terrible obstacle to all high advancement
the bees or the ants might have seemed to us more promising their smallness of size was not necessarily too much of a handicap they could have made poison their weapon for the subjugation of rivals
and in these orderly insects there are obviously a capacity for labor and co operative labor at that which could carry them far we all know that they have a marked genius great gifts of their own
in a civilization of super ants or bees there would have been no problem of the hungry unemployed no poverty no unstable government no riots no strikes for short hours
no derision of eugenics no thieves perhaps no crime at all ants are good citizens they place group interests first but they carry it so far they have few or no political rights
an ant doesnt have the vote apparently he just has his duties this quality may have something to do with their having groups wars the egotism of their individual spirits is allowed scant expression
so the egotism of the groups is extremely ferocious and active is this one of the reasons why ants fight so much we have seen the same phenomenon occur in certain nations of men and the ants commit atrocities in and after their battles that are
i wish i could truly say inhuman but conversely ants are absolutely unselfish within the community they are skilful ingenious their nests and buildings are relatively larger than mans
the scientists speak of their paved streets vaulted halls their hundreds of different domesticated animals their pluck and intelligence their individual initiative their chaste and industrious lives
darwin said the ants brain was one of the most marvelous atoms in the world perhaps more so than the brain of man yes of present day man who for thousands and thousands of years has had so much more chance to develop his brain
a thoughtful observer would have weighed all these excellent qualities when we think of these creatures as little men which is all wrong of course we see they have their faults to our eyes they seem too orderly for instance
repressively so their ways are more fixed than those of the old egyptians and their industry is painful to think of its hyper chinese but we must remember this is a simian comment
the instincts of the species that you and i belong to are of an opposite kind and that makes it hard for us to judge ants fairly but we and the ants are alike in one matter the strong love of property
and instead of merely struggling with nature for it they also fight other ants the custom of plunder seems to be a part of most of their wars this has gone on for ages among them and continues today
raids ferocious combats and loot are part of an ants regular life ant reformers if there were any might lay this to their property sense and talk of abolishing property as a cure for the evil
but that would not help for long unless they could abolish the love of it ants seem to care even more for property than we do ourselves we men are inclined to ease up a little when we have all we need
they cant bear to stop they keep right on working this means that ants do not contemplate they heed nothing outside of their own little rounds it is almost as though their fondness for labor had closed fast their minds
conceivably they might have developed inquiring minds but this would have run against their strongest instincts the ant is knowing and wise but he doesnt know enough to take a vacation
would they have been able therewith to rule their instincts or to stop work long enough to examine themselves or the universe or to dream of any noble development probably not reason is seldom or never the ruler
it is the servant of instinct it would therefore have told the ants that incessant toil was useful and good toil has brought you up from the ruck of things reason would have plausibly said
its by virtue of feverish toil that you have become what you are being endlessly industrious is the best road for you to the heights
some had over trustful characters like the seals or exploitable characters like cows and chickens and sheep such creatures sentence themselves to be captives by their lack of ambition dogs they have more spirit
but they have lost their chance of kingship through worshipping us the dogs finer qualities cant be praised too warmly there is a purity about his devotion which makes mere men feel speechless but with all love for dogs
one must grant they are vassals not rulers they are too parasitic the one willing servant class of the world and we have betrayed them by making under simians of them
loving us they let us stop their developing in tune with their natures and theyve patiently tried ever since to adopt ways of ours they have done it too but of course they cant get far its not their own road
dogs have more love than integrity theyve been true to us yes but they havent been true to themselves pigs the pig is remarkably intelligent and brave but hes gross
and grossness delays ones achievement it takes so much time the snake too though wise has a way of eating himself into stupors if super snake men had had banquets they would have been too vast to describe
and well should the elephant know it he had the best chance of all wiser even than the lion or the wisest of apes his wisdom furthermore was benign where theirs was sinister consider his dignity his poise and skill
he was plastic too he had learned to eat many foods and endure many climates once some say this race explored the globe their bones are found everywhere in south america even
so the elephants columbus may have found some road here before ours they are cosmopolitans these suave and well bred beings they have rich emotional natures long memories loyalty they are steady and sure
and not narrow not self absorbed for they seem interested in everything what was it then that put them out of the race could it have been a quite natural belief that they had already won and when they saw that they hadnt
and that the monkey men were getting ahead were they too great minded and decent to exterminate their puny rivals it may have been their tolerance and patience that betrayed them they wait too long before they resent an imposition or insult
just as ants are too energetic and cats too shrewd for their own highest good so the elephants suffer from too much patience their exhibitions of it may seem superb such power and such restraint combined are noble
more live and let live in allowing other species to stay here our way is to kill good and bad male and female and babies till the few last survivors lie hidden away from our guns
all species must surrender unconditionally those are our terms and come and live in barns alongside us or on us as parasites the creatures that want to live a life of their own we call wild if wild
then no matter how harmless we treat them as outlaws and those of us who are specially well brought up shoot them for fun some might be our friends we dont wish it we keep them all terrorized
when one of us conquering monkey men enters the woods most animals that scent him slink away or race off in a panic it is not that we have planned this deliberately but they know what were like race by race they have been slaughtered
soon all will be gone we give neither freedom nor life room to those we defeat if we had been as strong as the elephants we might have been kinder when great power comes naturally to people
it is used more urbanely we use it as parvenus do because thats what we are the elephant being born to it is easy going confident tolerant he would have been a more humane king
the elephant is stupid when it comes to learning how to use tools so are all other species except our own isnt it strange a tool in the most primitive sense is any object lying around
that can obviously be used as an instrument for this or that purpose many creatures use objects as materials as birds use twigs for nests but the step that no animal takes is learning freely to use things as instruments
when an elephant plucks off a branch and swishes his flanks and thus keeps away insects he is using a tool but he does it only by a vague and haphazard association of ideas if he once became a conscious user of tools
he would of course go much further we ourselves who are so good at it now were slow enough in beginning think of the long epochs that passed before it entered our heads
and all that while the contest for leadership blindly went on without any species making use of this obvious aid the lesson to be learned was simple the reward was the rule of a planet yet only one species our own
has ever had that much brains it makes you wonder what other obvious lessons may still be unlearned it is not necessarily stupid however to fail to use tools to use tools involves using reason
instead of sticking to instinct now sticking to instinct has its disadvantages but so has using reason whichever faculty you use the other atrophies and partly deserts you we are trying to use both
but we still dont know which has the more value a sudden vision comes to me of one of the first far away ape men who tried to use reason instead of instinct as a guide for his conduct i imagine him perched in his tree
torn between those two voices wailing loudly at night by a river in his puzzled distress my poor far off brother
and thereafter achieve a high civilization but that wasnt the problem the real problem
some quenchless desire to urge them on and on and also adaptability of a thousand kinds to their environment the rhinoceros cares little for adaptability he slogs through the world but we
we are experts adaptability is what we depend on we talk of our mastery of nature which sounds very grand but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves first to her ways
we attain no power over nature till we learn natural laws and our lordship depends on the adroitness with which we learn and conform adroitness however is merely an ability to win
back of it there must be some spur to make us use our adroitness why dont we all die or give up when were sick of the world because the love of life is reenforced in most energized beings
by some longing that pushes them forward in defeat and in darkness all creatures wish to live and to perpetuate their species of course but those two wishes alone evidently do not carry any race far
in addition to these a race to be great needs some hunger some itch to spur it up the hard path we lately have learned to call evolution the love of toil in the ants and of craft in cats are examples
sagacious bold and restless he pushed his way from town to town and pretended to have reached the mysterious mountains of appalache he sent to the fort mantles woven with feathers quivers covered with choice furs
arrows tipped with gold wedges of a green stone like beryl or emerald and other trophies of his wanderings a gentleman named grotaut took up the quest and penetrated to the dominions of hostaqua
who it was pretended could muster three or four thousand warriors and who promised with the aid of a hundred arquebusiers to conquer all the kings of the adjacent mountains and subject them and their gold mines to the rule of the french
a humbler adventurer was pierre gambie a robust and daring youth
and was now a soldier under laudonniere the latter gave him leave to trade with the indians a privilege which he used so well that he grew rich with his traffic became prime favorite with the chief of the island of edelano
married his daughter and in his absence reigned in his stead but as his sway verged towards despotism his subjects took offence and split his head with a hatchet during the winter
indians from the neighborhood of cape canaveral brought to the fort two spaniards wrecked fifteen years before on the southwestern extremity of the peninsula
they told of the king of cabs on whose domains they had been wrecked a chief mighty in stature and in power in one of his villages was a pit six feet deep and as wide as a hogshead
filled with treasure gathered from spanish wrecks on adjacent reefs and keys the monarch was a priest too and a magician with power over the elements each year he withdrew from the public gaze
to hold converse in secret with supernal or infernal powers and each year he sacrificed to his gods one of the spaniards whom the fortune of the sea had cast upon his shores
the name of the tribe is preserved in that of the river caboosa in close league with him was the mighty oathcaqua dwelling near cape canaveral who gave his daughter a maiden of wondrous beauty
in marriage to his great ally but as the bride with her bridesmaids was journeying towards calos escorted by a chosen band they were assailed by a wild and warlike race inhabitants of an island called
in the midst of a lake who put the warriors to flight bore the maidens captive to their watery fastness espoused them all and we are assured
begged for ten arquebusiers to aid him on a new raid
again alluring his greedy allies by the assurance that thus reinforced he would conquer for them a free access to the phantom gold mines of appalache ottigny set forth on this fools errand
with thrice the force demanded three hundred thirnagoas and thirty frenchmen took up their march through the pine barrens outinas conjurer was of the number and had wellnigh ruined the enterprise
with hideous grimaces howlings and contortions he wrought himself into a prophetic frenzy and proclaimed to the astounded warriors
panic slaughter and a plentiful harvest of scalps but no persuasion could induce outina to follow up his victory he went home to dance round his trophies and the french returned disgusted to fort caroline
and now in ample measure the french began to reap the harvest of their folly conquest gold and military occupation had alone been their aims
not a rod of ground had been stirred with the spade their stores were consumed and the expected supplies had not come the indians too were hostile satouriona hated them as allies of his enemies
and his tribesmen robbed and maltreated by the lawless soldiers exulted in their miseries yet in these their dark and subtle neighbors was their only hope may day came
the third anniversary of the day when ribaut and his companions full of delighted anticipation had first explored
for within the precinct of fort caroline a homesick squalid band dejected and worn dragged their shrunken limbs about the sun scorched area or lay stretched in listless wretchedness under the shade of the barracks
some were digging roots in the forest or gathering a kind of sorrel upon the meadows if they had had any skill in hunting and fishing the river and the woods would have supplied their needs but in this point as in others
they were lamentably unfit for the work they had taken in hand our miserie says laudonniere was so great that one was found that gathered up all the fish bones that he could finde which he dried
and beate into powder to make bread thereof the effects of this hideous famine appeared incontinently among us for our bones eftsoones beganne to cleave so neere unto the skinne
that the most part of the souldiers had their skinnes pierced thorow with them in many partes of their bodies yet giddy with weakness they dragged themselves in turn to the top of saint johns bluff straining their eyes across the sea
to descry the anxiously expected sail had coligny left them to perish or had some new tempest of calamity let loose upon france drowned the memory of their exile
in vain the watchman on the hill surveyed the solitude of waters a deep dejection fell upon them
could their eyes have pierced the future the indians had left the neighborhood but from time to time brought in meagre supplies of fish which they sold to the famished soldiers at exorbitant prices
lest they should pay the penalty of their extortion they would not enter the fort
beyond gunshot waiting for their customers to come out to them oftentimes says laudonniere our poor soldiers were constrained to give away the very shirts from their backs to get one fish if at any time they shewed unto the savages
the excessive price which they tooke these villaines would answere them roughly and churlishly if thou make so great account of thy marchandise eat it and we will eat our fish then fell they out a laughing and mocked us with open throat
the spring wore away and no relief appeared one thought now engrossed the colonists that of return to france vasseurs ship the breton still remained in the river
and they had also the spanish brigantine brought by the mutineers but these vessels were insufficient and they prepared to build a new one the energy of reviving hope lent new life to their exhausted frames
some gathered pitch in the pine forests some made charcoal
the maize began to ripen and this brought some relief but the indians exasperated and greedy sold it with reluctance and murdered two half famished frenchmen who gathered a handful in the fields
one astina the plunder of whose villages would yield an ample supply the offer was accepted ottigny and vasseur set out but were grossly deceived led against a different enemy
and sent back empty handed and half starved they returned to the fort in the words of laudonniere angry and pricked deepely to the quicke for being so mocked
and joined by all their comrades fiercely demanded to be led against outina to seize him punish his insolence and extort from his fears the supplies which could not be looked for from his gratitude the commandant was forced to comply
those who could bear the weight of their armor put it on embarked to the number of fifty in two barges and sailed up the river under laudonniere himself having reached outinas landing they marched inland entered his village
surrounded his mud plastered palace seized him amid the yells and howlings of his subjects and led him prisoner to their boats here anchored in mid stream
uttered moans and outcries from the strand yet no ransom was offered since reasoning from their own instincts they never doubted that after the price was paid the captive would be put to death laudonniere
waited two days and then descended the river with his prisoner
that he should be elected and now he did think it probable that he should get the seat on a petition a scrutiny used to be a very expensive business but under the existing law made as the scrutiny would be in the borough itself
it would cost but little and that little should he be successful would fall on the shoulders of mister browborough should he knock off eight votes and lose none himself he would be member for tankerville
he knew that many votes had been given for browborough which if the truth were known of them would be knocked off and he did not know that the same could be said of any one of those by which he had been supported
but unfortunately the judge by whom all this would be decided might not reach tankerville in his travels till after christmas perhaps not till after easter and in the meantime what should he do with himself
as for going back to dublin that was now out of the question he had entered upon a feverish state of existence in which it was impossible that he should live in ireland
he must vanish out of the world
he would not even endeavour to think how he might in such case best bestow himself for the present he would remain within the region of politics and live as near as he could to the whirl of the wheel of which the sound was so dear to him
so youre at the old game mister finn said his landlord yes at the old game i suppose its the same with you now mister bunce had been a very violent politician
pretty much the same mister finn i dont see that things are much better than they used to be they tell me at the peoples banner office that the lords have had as much to do with this election as with any that ever went before it
perhaps they dont know much about it at the peoples banner office i thought mister slide and the peoples banner had gone over to the other side bunce mister slide is pretty wide awake whatever side hes on
not but what hes disgraced himself by what hes been and done now mister slide in former days had been the editor of the peoples banner
but what a man keeps in the way of religion for his own use is never nothing to me as what i keeps is nothing to him im afraid you dont keep much mister bunce and thats nothing to you neither is it sir no indeed
but when we read of churches as is called state churches churches as have bishops you and i have to pay for as never goes into them but we dont pay the bishops mister bunce oh yes we do because if they wasnt paid
the money would come to us to do as we pleased with it we proved all that when we pared them down a bit whats an ecclesiastical commission only another name for a box to put the money into till you want to take it out again
just as the theatres are mister finn or the gin shops then i know theres a deal more to be done before honest men can come by their own youre right enough mister finn you are as far as churches go and you was right too when you cut and run off the treasury bench
i never expected this but ill do for you mister finn just as i ever did in the old days and it was i that was sorry when i heard of the poor young ladys death so i was mister finn well then i wont mention her name never again
but after all theres been betwixt you and us it wouldnt be natural to pass it by without one word would it mister finn well yes hes just the same man as ever
just as he used to do and never got so much out of it
that i dont know how to bear it well yes that is true mister finn there never was a man better at bringing home his money to his wife than bunce
if hed drink it which he never does i think id bear it better than give it to that nasty union and young jack writes as well as his father pretty nigh mister finn which is a comfort mister bunce was a journeyman scrivener at a law stationers
and keeps his self but he dont bring home his money nor yet it cant be expected mister finn i know what the young uns will do and what they wont and mary jane is quite handy about the house now only she do break things
which he used to know so well a hundred memories of former days crowded back upon him lord chiltern for a few months had lived with him and then there had arisen a quarrel which he had for a time thought would dissolve his old life into ruin
now lord chiltern was again his very intimate friend and there had used to sit a needy money lender whom
alas alas how soon might he now require that money lenders services and then he recollected how he had left these rooms to go into others grander and more appropriate to his life when he had filled high office under the state
would there ever again come to him such cause for migration and would he again be able to load the frame of the looking glass over the fire with countless cards from countesses and ministers wives he had opened the oyster for himself once
when the point of his knife had been withdrawn would he be able to insert the point again between those two difficult shells would the countesses once more be kind to him would drawing rooms be opened to him and sometimes opened to him and to no other
then he thought of certain special drawing rooms in which wonderful things had been said to him since that he had been a married man and those special drawing rooms and those wonderful words had in no degree actuated him in his choice of a wife
he had left all those things of his own free will as though telling himself that there was a better life than they offered to him but was he sure that he had found it to be better he had certainly sighed for the gauds which he had left
while his young wife was living he had kept his sighs down so that she should not hear them but he had been forced to acknowledge that his new life had been vapid and flavourless now he had been tempted back again to the old haunts
would the countesses cards be showered upon him again one card or rather note had reached him while he was yet at tankerville reminding him of old days it was from missus low the wife of the barrister
with whom he had worked when he had been a law student in london she had asked him to come and dine with them after the old fashion in baker street naming a day as to which she presumed that he would by that time have finished his affairs at tankerville
intimating also that mister low would then have finished his at north broughton now mister low had sat for north broughton before phineas left london and his wife spoke of the seat as a certainty
phineas could not keep himself from feeling that missus low intended to triumph over him but nevertheless he accepted the invitation they were very glad to see him explaining that
as nobody was supposed to be in town nobody had been asked to meet him in former days he had been very intimate in that house having received from both of them much kindness mingled perhaps with some touch of severity on the part of the lady
but the ground for that was gone and missus low was no longer painfully severe a few words were said as to his great loss missus low once raised her eyebrows in pretended surprise
when phineas explained that he had thrown up his place and then they settled down on the question of the day and so said missus low youve begun to attack the church it must be remembered that at this moment mister daubeny
and if her husband could not be said to live by means of the same atmosphere it was because the breath of his nostrils had been drawn chiefly in the vice chancellors court in lincolns inn but he no doubt
would be very much disturbed indeed should he ever be told that he was required as an expectant member of mister daubenys party to vote for the disestablishment
you dont mean that i am guilty of throwing the first stone said phineas they have been throwing stones at the temple since first it was built said missus low with energy but they have fallen off its polished shafts in dust and fragments
i am afraid that missus low when she allowed herself to speak thus energetically entertained some confused idea that the church of england and the christian religion were one and the same thing or at least that they had been brought into the world together
you havent thrown the first stone said mister low but you have taken up the throwing at the first moment in which stones may be dangerous no stones can be dangerous said missus low
the idea of a state church said phineas is opposed to my theory of political progress what i hope is that my friends will not suppose that i attack the protestant church because i am a roman catholic if i were a priest
it would be my business to do so but i am not a priest mister low gave his old friend a bottle of his best wine and in all friendly observances treated him with due affection but neither did he nor did his wife
for a moment abstain from attacking their guest in respect to his speeches at tankerville it seemed indeed to phineas that as missus low was buckled up in such triple armour that she feared nothing
she might have been less loud in expressing her abhorrence of the enemies of the church if she feared nothing why should she scream so loudly between the two he was a good deal crushed and confounded
and missus low was very triumphant when she allowed him to escape from her hands at ten oclock but at that moment nothing had as yet been heard in baker street of mister daubenys proposition to the electors of east barsetshire
poor missus low we can foresee that there is much grief in store for her and some rocks ahead too in the political career of her husband phineas was still in london hanging about the clubs doing nothing
discussing mister daubenys wonderful treachery with such men as came up to town and waiting for the meeting of parliament when he received the following letter from lady laura kennedy dresden november eighteenth
i have heard with great pleasure from my sister in law that you have been staying with them at harrington hall it seems so like old days that you and oswald and violet should be together so much more natural
than that you should be living in dublin i cannot conceive of you as living any other life than that of the house of commons downing street and the clubs nor do i wish to do so
and when i hear of you at harrington hall i know that you are on your way to the other things do tell me what life is like with oswald and violet of course he never writes he is one of those men who on marrying
assume that they have at last got a person to do a duty which has always hitherto been neglected violet does write
as the wife of a master of hounds
as the art is real she told me how poor dear lady baldock communicated to you her unhappiness about her daughter in a manner that made even me laugh and would make thousands laugh in days to come were it ever to be published
but of her inside life of her baby or of her husband as a husband she never says a word you will have seen it all and have enough of the feminine side of a mans character to be able to tell me how they are living
i am sure they are happy together because violet has more common sense than any woman i ever knew and pray tell me about the affair at tankerville my cousin barrington writes me word that you will certainly get the seat
he declares that mister browborough is almost disposed not to fight the battle though a man more disposed to fight never bribed an elector but barrington seems to think that you managed as well as you did by getting outside the traces as he calls it
we certainly did not think that you would come out strong against the church
but if it must come why not by your hands as well as by any other it is hardly possible that you in your heart should love a protestant ascendant church but as barrington says a horse wont get oats
at home as you know not only did he take an active part in politics but he was active also in the management of his own property now it seems to him to be almost too great a trouble to write a letter to his steward
or to remain here by myself but he will consent to neither in truth the burden of idleness has now fallen upon him so heavily that he cannot shake it off he dreads that he may be called upon to do anything
to me it is all one tragedy i cannot but think of things as they were two or three years since my father and my husband were both in the cabinet and you young as you were stood but one step below it oswald was out in the cold he was very poor
papa thought all evil of him violet had refused him over and over again he quarrelled with you and all the world seemed against him then of a sudden you vanished and we vanished an ineffable misery fell upon me and upon my wretched husband
all our good things went from us at a blow i and my poor father became as it were outcasts but oswald suddenly retricked his beams and is flaming in the forehead of the morning sky he i believe
he won his wife honestly did he not and he has ever been honest it is my pride to think i never gave him up but the bitter part of my cup consists in this that as he has won what he has deserved so have we
i complain of no injustice our castle was built upon the sand why should mister kennedy have been a cabinet minister and why should i have been his wife
there is no one whom i can ask to tell me of him that he did not attend during the last session i do know and we presume that he has now abandoned his seat i fear that his health is bad
by the gloom of his life i suppose that he lives exclusively at loughlinter from time to time i am implored by him to return to my duty beneath his roof he grounds his demand on no affection of his own
on no presumption that any affection can remain with me he says no word of happiness he offers no comfort he does not attempt to persuade with promises of future care he makes his claim simply on holy writ and on the feeling of duty which
thence ought to weigh upon me he has never even told me that he loves me but he is persistent in declaring that those whom god has joined together nothing human should separate
i have told papa that i should ask you and he would be delighted
to be able to talk again to one who knows all the errors and all the efforts of my past life as you do dresden is very cold in the winter i do not know whether you would mind that we are very particular about the rooms but my father bears the temperature wonderfully well
though he complains in march we move down south for a couple of months do come if you can most sincerely yours laura kennedy
emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence
very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma
the real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself
these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived
sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss taylors loss which first brought grief
it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mister weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners
and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black mornings work for her
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old
how she had devoted all her powers
and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve
which had soon followed isabellas marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent
well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers
only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her
rational or playful the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mister woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits
for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony
being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach
through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband
but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke
matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection
when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done
as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts
but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mister weston ever thought of her
and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear
you know we have settled all that already
that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her
i am sure she will be an excellent servant
he will be able to tell her how we all are emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening
and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mister knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty
was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabellas husband he lived about a mile from highbury
was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner
mister knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mister woodhouse gratefully observed
i wish you may not catch cold dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them
i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
poor mister and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate
it must be better to have only one to please than two especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature
i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome my dearest papa
what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mister knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke
it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mister knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylors advantage
she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylors time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision
and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right
may comfort me for any thing mister knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass
and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful
mister weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mister weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed
and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago
and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa
if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young ladys mind
your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mister weston were to marry her
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it
and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
understanding but in part but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up ones family circle grievously
poor mister elton you like mister elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably
that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mister elton
and this is the only way i have of doing him a service mister elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear
ask him to come and dine with us some day
i dare say mister knightley will be so kind as to meet him
but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind
and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family
and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend
miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate
and it took place to the infinite mortification of mister and missus churchill
missus weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit
she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brothers unreasonable anger
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home
she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe captain weston who had been considered
and mister and missus churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease
and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade
having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury
where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence
enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor
and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth
till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through
he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be
on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his fathers assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely
but it was not in mister westons nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him
mister frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed
but never achieved now upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention
either when missus perry drank tea with missus and miss bates or when missus and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mister frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened
when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter missus weston had received
i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mister frank churchill has written to missus weston
missus weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense
and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought
but dear emma was of no feeble character
and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield
her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to missus weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just
and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize
taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own
but never did she go without mister woodhouses giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay
there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mister woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over
but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone
mister woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter
he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties
and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him real long standing regard brought the westons and mister knightley
and by mister elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mister woodhouses drawing room
and missus goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mister woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses
for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself
she loved every body was interested in every bodys happiness quicksighted to every bodys merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother
and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body
and a mine of felicity to herself she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mister woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip missus goddard was the mistress of a school
and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price
for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer
hung round with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect
it was no remedy for the absence of missus weston she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well
but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day
to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty
a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody somebody had placed her several years back at missus goddards school
she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person
and quite determined to continue the acquaintance she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy
not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield
and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement encouragement should be given
those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her
she would form her opinions and her manners it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers
she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which
always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit
which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal
he loved to have the cloth laid
and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say
missus bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome
i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you
what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style
and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy
chapter sixteen no one in all raymond including the rectangle felt loreens death more keenly than virginia it came like a distinct personal loss to her
that short week while the girl had been in her home had opened virginias heart to a new life she was talking it over with rachel the day after the funeral
i am going to do something with my money to help those women to a better life virginia looked over to the end of the hall where the day before loreens body had lain i have decided on a good plan as it seems to me
i have talked it over with rollin he will devote a large part of his money also to the same plan how much money have you virginia to give in this way asked rachel once she would never have asked such a personal question
now it seemed as natural to talk frankly about money as about anything else that belonged to god i have available for use at least four hundred and fifty thousand dollars rollin has as much more
it is one of his bitter regrets now that his extravagant habits of life before his conversion practically threw away half that father left him we are both eager to make all the reparation in our power what would jesus do with this money
we want to answer that question honestly and wisely the money i shall put into the news is i am confident in a line with his probable action
it is as necessary that we have a christian daily paper in raymond especially now that we have the saloon influence to meet as it is to have a church or a college so i am satisfied that the five hundred thousand dollars that mister norman will know how to use so well
will be a powerful factor in raymond to do as jesus would about my other plan rachel i want you to work with me
the field where the tent now is has been in litigation for years we mean to secure the entire tract as soon as the courts have settled the title for some time i have been making a special study of the various forms of college settlements and residence methods
of christian work and institutional church work in the heart of great city slums i do not know that i have yet been able to tell just what is the wisest and most effective kind of work that can be done in raymond but i do know this much
my money i mean gods which he wants me to use can build wholesome lodging houses refuges for poor women asylums for shop girls safety for many and many a lost girl like loreen
and i do not want to be simply a dispenser of this money god help me i do want to put myself into the problem but you know rachel i have a feeling all the time that all that limitless money and limitless personal sacrifice can possibly do
will not really lessen very much the awful condition at the rectangle as long as the saloon is legally established there i think that is true of any christian work now being carried on in any great city
the saloon furnishes material to be saved faster than the settlement or residence or rescue mission work can save it virginia suddenly rose and paced the hall rachel answered sadly and yet with a note of hope in her voice
but virginia what a wonderful amount of good can be done with this money and the saloon cannot always remain here the time must come when the christian forces in the city will triumph virginia paused near rachel and her pale earnest face lighted up
i believe that too the number of those who have promised to do as jesus would is increasing if we once have say five hundred such disciples in raymond the saloon is doomed
but now dear i want you to look at your part in this plan for capturing and saving the rectangle your voice is a power i have had many ideas lately here is one of them you could organize among the girls a musical institute
give them the benefit of your training there are some splendid voices in the rough there did any one ever hear such singing as that yesterday by those women rachel what a beautiful opportunity
you shall have the best of material in the way of organs and orchestras that money can provide and what cannot be done with music to win souls there into higher and purer and better living
before virginia had ceased speaking rachels face was perfectly transformed with the thought of her life work it flowed into her heart and mind like a flood and the torrent of her feeling overflowed in tears that could not be restrained
it was what she had dreamed of doing herself it represented to her something that she felt was in keeping with a right use of her talent yes she said as she rose and put her arm about virginia
while both girls in the excitement of their enthusiasm paced the hall yes i will gladly put my life into that kind of service i do believe that jesus would have me use my life in this way virginia what miracles can we not accomplish in humanity
if we have such a lever as consecrated money to move things with add to it consecrated personal enthusiasm like yours and it certainly can accomplish great things said virginia smiling
rollin came back and sat down and together the three discussed their future plans rollin was apparently entirely free from embarrassment in rachels presence while virginia was with them only his manner with her was almost precise if not cold
the past seemed to have been entirely absorbed in his wonderful conversion he had not forgotten it but he seemed to be completely caught up for this present time in the purpose of his new life
after a while rollin was called out and rachel and virginia began to talk of other things by the way what has become of jasper chase virginia asked the question innocently but rachel flushed and virginia added with a smile
i suppose he is writing another book is he going to put you into this one rachel you know i always suspected jasper chase of doing that very thing in his first story virginia
rachel spoke with the frankness that had always existed between the two friends jasper chase told me the other night that he in fact he proposed to me or he would if
rachel stopped and sat with her hands clasped on her lap and there were tears in her eyes virginia i thought a little while ago i loved him as he said he loved me but when he spoke my heart felt repelled and i said what i ought to say
i told him no i have not seen him since that was the night of the first conversions at the rectangle i am glad for you said virginia quietly why asked rachel a little startled
because i have never really liked jasper chase he is too cold and i do not like to judge him but i have always distrusted his sincerity in taking the pledge at the church with the rest
rachel looked at virginia thoughtfully i have never given my heart to him i am sure he touched my emotions and i admired his skill as a writer i have thought at times that i cared a good deal for him
i think perhaps if he had spoken to me at any other time than the one he chose i could easily have persuaded myself that i loved him but not now again rachel paused suddenly and when she looked up at virginia again there were tears on her face
virginia came to her and put her arm about her tenderly when rachel had left the house virginia sat in the hall thinking over the confidence her friend had just shown her there was something still to be told virginia felt sure from rachels manner
but she did not feel hurt that rachel had kept back something she was simply conscious of more on rachels mind than she had revealed very soon rollin came back and he and virginia arm in arm as they had lately been in the habit of doing walked up and down the long hall
it was easy for their talk to settle finally upon rachel because of the place she was to occupy in the plans which were being made for the purchase of property at the rectangle
did you ever know of a girl of such really gifted powers in vocal music who was willing to give her life to the people as rachel is going to do she is going to give music lessons in the city have private pupils to make her living
and then give the people in the rectangle the benefit of her culture and her voice it is certainly a very good example of self sacrifice replied rollin a little stiffly virginia looked at him a little sharply
but dont you think it is a very unusual example can you imagine here virginia named half a dozen famous opera singers doing anything of this sort no i cannot rollin answered briefly
neither can i imagine miss he spoke the name of the girl with the red parasol who had begged virginia to take the girls to the rectangle doing what you are doing virginia any more than i can imagine mister
virginia spoke the name of a young society leader going about to the clubs doing your work rollin the two walked on in silence for the length of the hall coming back to rachel began virginia
rollin why do you treat her with such a distinct precise manner i think rollin pardon me if i hurt you that she is annoyed by it you need to be on easy terms i dont think rachel likes this change
rollin suddenly stopped he seemed deeply agitated he took his arm from virginias and walked alone to the end of the hall then he returned with his hands behind him and stopped near his sister and said
virginia have you not learned my secret virginia looked bewildered then over her face the unusual color crept showing that she understood i have never loved any one but rachel winslow rollin spoke calmly enough now
that day she was here when you talked about her refusal to join the concert company i asked her to be my wife out there on the avenue she refused me as i knew she would and she gave as her reason the fact that i had no purpose in life which was true enough
now that i have a purpose now that i am a new man dont you see virginia how impossible it is for me to say anything i owe my very conversion to rachels singing
and yet that night while she sang i can honestly say that for the time being i never thought of her voice except as gods message i believe that all my personal love for her was for the time merged into a personal love to my god and my saviour
rollin was silent then he went on with more emotion i still love her virginia
he stopped and looked his sister in the face with a sad smile i dont know about that said virginia to herself she was noting rollins handsome face his marks of dissipation nearly all gone now
the firm lips showing manhood and courage the clear eyes looking into hers frankly the form strong and graceful rollin was a man now why should not rachel come to love him in time
he had come suddenly upon her as he turned into the avenue and his heart had leaped up at the sight of her he walked along by her now rejoicing after all in a little moment of this earthly love he could not drive out of his life i have just been over to see virginia
said rachel she tells me the arrangements are nearly completed for the transfer of the rectangle property yes it has been a tedious case in the courts did virginia show you all the plans and specifications for building
we looked over a good many it is astonishing to me where virginia has managed to get all her ideas about this work virginia knows more now about arnold toynbee and east end london and institutional church work in america
than a good many professional slum workers she has been spending nearly all summer in getting information rollin was beginning to feel more at ease as they talked over this coming work of humanity it was safe common ground
what have you been doing all summer i have not seen much of you rachel suddenly asked and then her face warmed with its quick flush of tropical color as if she might have implied too much interest in rollin or too much regret at not seeing him oftener
i have been busy replied rollin briefly tell me something about it persisted rachel you say so little
she put the question very frankly turning toward rollin in real earnest yes certainly he replied with a graceful smile i am not so certain that i can tell you much
i have been trying to find some way to reach the men i once knew and win them into more useful lives he stopped suddenly as if he were almost afraid to go on rachel did not venture to suggest anything
i have been a member of the same company to which you and virginia belong continued rollin beginning again i have made the pledge to do as i believe jesus would do
and it is in trying to answer this question that i have been doing my work that is what i do not understand virginia told me about the other it seems wonderful to think that you are trying to keep that pledge with us but what can you do with the club men
you have asked me a direct question and i shall have to answer it now replied rollin smiling again you see i asked myself after that night at the tent you remember he spoke hurriedly and his voice trembled a little
what purpose i could now have in my life to redeem it to satisfy my thought of christian discipleship and the more i thought of it the more i was driven to a place where i knew i must take up the cross
did you ever think that of all the neglected beings in our social system none are quite so completely left alone as the fast young men who fill the clubs and waste their time and money as i used to
the churches look after the poor miserable creatures like those in the rectangle they make some effort to reach the working man they have a large constituency among the average salary earning people they send money and missionaries to the foreign heathen
but the fashionable dissipated young men around town the club men are left out of all plans for reaching and christianizing and yet no class of people need it more i said to myself i know these men their good and their bad qualities i have been one of them
i am not fitted to reach the rectangle people i do not know how but i think i could possibly reach some of the young men and boys who have money and time to spend so that is what i have been trying to do
when i asked as you did what would jesus do that was my answer
rollins voice was so low on this last sentence that rachel had difficulty in hearing him above the noise around them but she knew what he had said she wanted to ask what his methods were but she did not know how to ask him
her interest in his plan was larger than mere curiosity rollin page was so different now from the fashionable young man who had asked her to be his wife that she could not help thinking of him and talking with him as if he were an entirely new acquaintance
they had turned off the avenue and were going up the street to rachels home it was the same street where rollin had asked rachel why she could not love him they were both stricken with a sudden shyness as they went on
rachel had not forgotten that day and rollin could not she finally broke a long silence by asking what she had not found words for before
in your work with the club men with your old acquaintances what sort of reception do they give you how do you approach them what do they say rollin was relieved when rachel spoke he answered quickly oh it depends on the man
a good many of them think i am a crank i have kept my membership up and am in good standing in that way i try to be wise and not provoke any unnecessary criticism but you would be surprised to know how many of the men have responded to my appeal
i could hardly make you believe that only a few nights ago a dozen men became honestly and earnestly engaged in a conversation over religious matters i have had the great joy of seeing some of the men give up bad habits and begin a new life
what would jesus do i keep asking it the answer comes slowly for i am feeling my way slowly one thing i have found out the men are not fighting shy of me i think that is a good sign
another thing i have actually interested some of them in the rectangle work and when it is started up they will give something to help make it more powerful and in addition to all the rest i have found a way to save several of the young fellows from going to the bad in gambling
rollin spoke with enthusiasm his face was transformed by his interest in the subject which had now become a part of his real life rachel again noted the strong manly tone of his speech
with it all she knew there was a deep underlying seriousness which felt the burden of the cross even while carrying it with joy the next time she spoke it was with a swift feeling of justice due to rollin and his new life
do you remember i reproached you once for not having any purpose worth living for she asked while her beautiful face seemed to rollin more beautiful than ever when he had won sufficient self control to look up i want to say
i feel the need of saying in justice to you now that i honor you for your courage and your obedience to the promise you have made as you interpret the promise the life you are living is a noble one rollin trembled his agitation was greater than he could control
rachel could not help seeing it they walked along in silence at last rollin said i thank you it has been worth more to me than i can tell you to hear you say that he looked into her face for one moment
she read his love for her in that look but he did not speak when they separated rachel went into the house and sitting down in her room she put her face in her hands and said to herself
i am beginning to know what it means to be loved by a noble man i shall love rollin page after all what am i saying rachel winslow have you forgotten she rose and walked back and forth she was deeply moved
nevertheless it was evident to herself that her emotion was not that of regret or sorrow somehow a glad new joy had come to her
it was indeed a part of it for if she was beginning to love rollin page it was the christian man she had begun to love the other never would have moved her to this great change
and rollin as he went back treasured a hope that had been a stranger to him since rachel had said no that day
in that hope he went on with his work as the days sped on and at no time was he more successful in reaching and saving his old acquaintances than in the time that followed that chance meeting with rachel winslow
the summer had gone and raymond was once more facing the rigor of her winter season virginia had been able to accomplish a part of her plan for capturing the rectangle as she called it
but the building of houses in the field the transforming of its bleak bare aspect into an attractive park all of which was included in her plan was a work too large to be completed that fall after she had secured the property
but a million dollars in the hands of a person who truly wants to do with it as jesus would
ought to accomplish wonders for humanity in a short time and henry maxwell going over to the scene of the new work one day after a noon hour with the shop men was amazed to see how much had been done outwardly
yet he walked home thoughtfully and on his way he could not avoid the question of the continual problem thrust upon his notice by the saloon how much had been done for the rectangle after all
even counting virginias and rachels work and mister grays where had it actually counted in any visible quantity
of course he said to himself the redemptive work begun and carried on by the holy spirit in his wonderful displays of power in the first church and in the tent meetings had had its effect upon the life of raymond
but as he walked past saloon after saloon and noted the crowds going in and coming out of them as he saw the wretched dens as many as ever apparently
he sickened at the sight he found himself asking how much cleansing could a million dollars poured into this cesspool accomplish
was not the living source of nearly all the human misery they sought to relieve untouched as long as the saloons did their deadly but legitimate work
was it not a practical waste of beautiful lives for these young women to throw themselves into this earthly hell when for every soul rescued by their sacrifice the saloon made two more that needed rescue he could not escape the question
it was the same that virginia had put to rachel in her statement that in her opinion nothing really permanent would ever be done until the saloon was taken out of the rectangle
henry maxwell went back to his parish work that afternoon with added convictions on the license business but if the saloon was a factor in the problem of the life of raymond no less was the first church and its little company of disciples who had pledged to do as jesus would do
henry maxwell standing at the very centre of the movement was not in a position to judge of its power as some one from the outside might have done but raymond itself felt the touch in very many ways not knowing all the reasons for the change
the winter was gone and the year was ended the year which henry maxwell had fixed as the time during which the pledge should be kept to do as jesus would do sunday the anniversary of that one a year ago was in many ways the most remarkable day that the first church ever knew
chapter twenty nine as bibbs came out of the new house a sunday trio was in course of passage upon the sidewalk an ample young woman placid of face a black clad
thin young man whose expression was one of habitual anxiety habitual wariness and habitual eagerness he propelled a perambulator containing the third
sundayfied and made fit to dine with the wifes relatives howd you like for me to be that young fella mamma the husband whispered hes one of the sons and there aint but two left now
the wife stared curiously at bibbs well i dont know she returned he looks to me like he had his own troubles i expect he has like anybody else said the young husband but i guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money
well maybe if you keep on the way you been
she glanced back at bibbs who had turned north he walks kind of slow and stooped over like so much money in his pockets it makes him sag i guess said the young husband with bitter admiration
mary happening to glance from a window saw bibbs coming and she started clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm
what is the matter i saw something was terribly wrong when i
she paused and he came in not lifting his eyes to hers always when he crossed that threshold he had come with his head up and his wistful gaze seeking hers
ah poor boy she said with a gesture of understanding and pity i know what it is he followed her into the room where they always sat and sank into a chair you neednt tell me she said
theyve made you give up your fathers won youre going to do what he wants youve given up
affirmation she gave a little cry of compassion and came and sat near him bibbs she said i can be glad of one thing though its selfish i can be glad you came straight to me its more to me than even if youd come because you were happy
she did not speak again for a little while then she said
could you tell me about it do you want to still he did not look up but in a voice shaken and husky he asked her a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood his words
mary he said could you marry me what did you say bibbs she asked quietly his tone and attitude did not change will you marry me
both of her hands leaped to her cheeks she grew red and then white she rose slowly and moved backward from him staring at him at first incredulously then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous in her wide eyes
it was like a spoken question the room filled with strangeness in the long silence the two were so strange to each other at last she said what made you say that he did not answer
bibbs look at me her voice was loud and clear what made you say that look at me he could not look at her and he could not speak what was it that made you she said i want you to tell me
youve given up to your father she said slowly and then you came to ask me she broke off
yes he said just audibly no she cried you do not then what made you ask me what is it thats happened nothing wait she said
let me think its something that happened since our walk this morning yes since you left me at noon something happened that she stopped abruptly
with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension she remembered that sibyl had gone to the new house bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say i do i do want you to marry me if if
you could she looked at him and slowly shook her head bibbs do you her voice was as unsteady as his little more than a whisper do you think im
in love with you no he said somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word it did not seem to come from marys parted lips but he was aware of it why
ive had nothing but dreams bibbs said desolately but they werent like that sibyl said no girl could care about me he smiled faintly
and when i first came home edith told me sibyl was so anxious to marry that shed have married me she meant it to express sibyls extremity you see but i hardly needed either of them to tell me i hadnt thought of myself as
well not as particularly captivating oddly enough marys pallor changed to an angry flush those two she exclaimed sharply and then with thoroughgoing contempt lamhorn thats like them
she turned away went to the bare little black mantel and stood leaning upon it presently she asked when did missus roscoe sheridan say that no girl could care about you
to day mary drew a deep breath i think im beginning to understand a little she bit her lip there was anger in good truth in her eyes and in her voice
answer me once more she said bibbs do you know now why i stopped wearing my furs yes i thought so your sister in law told you didnt she i
i heard her say i think i know what happened now marys breath came fast and her voice shook but she spoke rapidly you heard her say more than that you heard her say that we were bitterly poor and on that account i tried first to marry your brother and then
and then that i tried to marry you you heard her say that and you believe that i dont care for you and that no girl could care for you but you think i am in such an extremity as sibyl was
you took your fathers offer and then came to ask me to marry you what had i shown you of myself that could make you suddenly she sank down kneeling with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of a chair
tears overwhelming her mary mary he cried helplessly oh no you you dont understand i do though she sobbed i do he came and stood beside her you kill me
he said i cant make it plain from the first of your loveliness to me i was all self it was always you that gave and i that took i was the dependent i did nothing but lean on you
you seemed to lean down out of a rosy cloud to be kind to me i never dreamed i could do anything for you i never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody
and to day i heard that that you
anybody with money she sobbed and you thought we were so so desperate you believed that i had no he said quickly i didnt believe youd done one kind thing for me for that no no no
i knew youd never thought of me except generously to give i said i couldnt make it plain he cried despairingly wait she lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously like a child
help me up bibbs then when she was once more upon her feet she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly but reassuringly as if to tell him in that way
that she knew he had not meant to hurt her and that smile of hers so lamentable but so faithfully friendly misted his own eyes for his shamefacedness lowered them no more
let me tell you what you want to tell me she said you cant because you cant put it into words they are too humiliating for me and youre too gentle to say them tell me though isnt it true
you didnt believe that id tried to make you fall in love with me never never for an instant you didnt believe id tried to make you want to marry me no no no i believe it bibbs
you thought that i was fond of you you knew i cared for you but you didnt think i might be in love with you but you thought that i might marry you without being in love with you
because you did believe i had tried to marry your brother and mary i only knew for the first time that you that you were were desperately poor she said you cant even say that bibbs it was true
i did try to make jim want to marry me i did and she sank down into the chair weeping bitterly again bibbs was agonized mary he groaned
i didnt know you could cry listen she said listen till i get through i want you to understand we were poor and we werent fitted to be we never had been and we didnt know what to do
wed been almost rich there was plenty but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town he wanted to be richer but instead well just about the time your father finished building next door
we found we hadnt anything people say that sometimes meaning that they havent anything in comparison with other people of their own kind but we really hadnt anything we hadnt anything at all bibbs
you might wonder why i didnt
and i wonder myself why when a family loses its money people always say the daughters ought to go and be stenographers its curious
no id been raised to be either married comfortably or a well to do old maid if i chose not to marry the poverty came on slowly bibbs but at last it was all there
and i didnt know how to be a stenographer i didnt know how to be anything except a well to do old maid or somebodys wife and i couldnt be a well to do old maid then bibbs i did what id been raised to know how to do
i went out to be fascinating and be married i did it openly at least and with a kind of decent honesty i told your brother i had meant to fascinate him
but i let him think that perhaps i meant to marry him i think i did mean to marry him i had never cared for anybody and i thought it might be there really wasnt anything more than a kind of excited fondness i cant be sure
but i think that though i did mean to marry him i never should have done it because that sort of a marriage is its sacrilege something would have stopped me
she meant no harm but she was horrible and she put what i was doing into such horrible words and they were the truth oh i saw myself she was proposing a miserable compact with me
and i couldnt breathe the air of the same room with her though id so cheapened myself she had a right to assume that i would but i couldnt i left her and i wrote to your brother just a quick scrawl i told him just what id done
i asked his pardon and i said i would not marry him i posted the letter but he never got it that was the afternoon he was killed thats all bibbs now you know what i did and you know
she pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes leaning far forward her head bowed before him bibbs had forgotten himself long ago his heart broke for her couldnt you isnt there
wont you he stammered mary im going with father isnt there some way you could use the money without without she gave a choked little laugh you gave me something to live for he said you kept me alive i think
and ive hurt you like this
oh a thousand times her right hand went out in a faltering gesture and just touched his own for an instant but theres nothing to forgive and you cant you cant
cant what bibbs you couldnt marry you she said for him yes no no no she sprang up facing him
and without knowing what she did she set her hands upon his breast pushing him back from her a little i cant i cant dont you see mary no no and you must go now bibbs i cant bear any more please
mary never never never she cried in a passion of tears you mustnt come any more i cant see you dear never never never somehow in helpless stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture
he got himself to the door
chapter eight the great fight for clean government
as to the government of this city said mister newberry leaning back in a leather armchair at the mausoleum club and lighting a second cigar its rotten thats all
absolutely rotten assented mister dick overend ringing the bell for a second whiskey and soda corrupt said mister newberry between two puffs of his cigar full of graft said mister overend
flicking his ashes into the grate crooked aldermen said mister newberry a bum city solicitor said mister overend and an infernal grafter for treasurer yes assented mister newberry
and then leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the corridors of the club he spoke behind his hand and said and the mayors the biggest grafter of the lot and whats more he added
sinking his voice to a whisper the time has come to speak out about it fearlessly mister overend nodded its a tyranny he said worse than russia rejoined mister newberry
they had been sitting in a quiet corner of the club it was on a sunday evening
not argumentatively or with any heat but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on the decadence of the present day
the rottenness of the federal government didnt anger them it merely grieved them they could remember both of them how different everything was when they were young men just entering on life
when mister newberry and mister dick overend were young men went into congress from pure patriotism there was no such thing as graft or crookedness as they both admitted in those days and as for the united states senate
here their voices were almost hushed in awe why when they were young the united states senate but no neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning they merely repeated
and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda then naturally speaking of the rottenness of the federal government had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature
how different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men not merely different in the matter of graft but different so mister newberry said in the calibre of the men
he recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate he would never forget it giants he said that was what they were in fact the thing was more like a witenagemot
than a legislature he said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didnt recollect speaking on a question he didnt just remember what either for or against
it thrilled him he would never forget it it stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday but as for the present legislature here mister dick overend sadly nodded assent in advance to what he knew was coming
as for the present legislature well mister newberry had had he said occasion to visit the state capital a week before in connection with a railway bill that he was trying to that is that he was anxious to
from speaking of the crookedness of the state government mister newberry and mister dick overend were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government and they both agreed as above that things were worse than in russia what secretly irritated them both most
was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for thirty or forty years and hadnt noticed it they had been too busy the fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas
as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community there had come a moment quite suddenly it seemed when it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten the word is a strong one
but it is the one that was used look at the aldermen they said rotten look at the city solicitor rotten and as for the mayor himself phew the thing came like a wave
everybody felt it at once people wondered how any sane intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the twenty aldermen of the city their names it was said
were simply a byword throughout the united states for rank criminal corruption this was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow
and as a matter of fact at the moment when this wave of feeling struck the city nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway to tell the truth the aldermen had been much the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years some were in the produce business
others were butchers two were grocers and all of them wore blue checkered waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets nobody had ever really thought about them that is to say nobody on plutoria avenue
sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it one said oh i see an alderman and turned to something else whose funeral is that
a man would sometimes ask on plutoria avenue oh just one of the city aldermen
oh i see i beg your pardon i thought it might be somebody important
how and where this movement of indignation had started people said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire united states certainly it was being remarked in almost every section of the country
chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigour and the fresh ideals of the middle west in boston it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old new england spirit in philadelphia
they called it the spirit of william penn in the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north while in the north they recognized it at once
as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south in the west they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west but everywhere they hailed it as a new sign of the glorious
unity of the country if therefore mister newberry and mister overend were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment in fact in the same city hundreds of other citizens
as disinterested as themselves were waking up to the realization of what was going on as soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city they were horrified at what they found it was discovered for example
in a city with a hundred and fifty deaths a week and sometimes even better an undertaker sat on the council a city that was about to expropriate land and to spend four hundred thousand dollars for a new cemetery had an undertaker
on the expropriation committee itself and worse than that alderman undercutt was a butcher in a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week and alderman ohooligan it leaked out was an irishman
imagine it an irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where thirty eight and a half out of every hundred policemen were irish either by birth or parentage the thing was monstrous so
when mister newberry said its worse than russia he meant it every word now just as mister newberry and mister dick overend were finishing their discussion the huge bulky form of mayor mc grath came ponderously past them as they sat
he looked at them sideways out of his eyes he had eyes like plums in a mottled face and being a born politician he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about but
being a politician he merely said good evening gentlemen without a sign of disturbance good evening mister mayor said mister newberry rubbing his hands feebly together and speaking in an
ingratiating tone there is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evil doer good evening mister mayor echoed mister dick overend also rubbing his hands
warm evening is it not the mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself did he hear
whispered mister newberry as the mayor passed out of the club i dont care if he did whispered mister dick overend half an hour later mayor mc grath entered the premises of the thomas jefferson club
which was situated in the rear end of a saloon and pool room far down in the town boys he said to alderman ohooligan and alderman gorfinkel who were playing freeze out poker in a corner behind the pool tables
you want to let the boys know to keep pretty dark and go easy theres a lot of talk i dont like about the elections going round the town let the boys know that just for a while the darker they keep the better whereupon the word was passed
from the thomas jefferson club to the george washington club and thence to the eureka club coloured and to the kossuth club hungarian and to various other centres of civic patriotism in the lower parts of the city
in the centre of west lynne stood two houses adjoining each other one large the other much smaller the large one was the carlyle residence and the small one was devoted to the carlyle offices the name of carlyle bore a lofty standing in the county
the first missus carlyle having been mister davidsons sister she had died and left one child the second missus carlyle died when her son was born archibald and his half sister reared him loved him and ruled him
with an iron hand she liked to rule him now in great things as in small just as she had done in the days of his babyhood and archibald generally submitted for the force of habit is strong she was a woman of strong sense
was left equally divided between cornelia and archibald archibald was no blood relation to him but he loved the open hearted boy better than his niece cornelia of mister carlyles property a small portion only was bequeathed to his daughter
the rest to his son and in this perhaps there was justice since the twenty thousand pounds brought to mister carlyle by his second wife had been chiefly instrumental in the accumulation of his large fortune miss carlyle or as she was called in town miss corny
had never married it was pretty certain she never would people thought that her intense love of her young brother kept her single for it was not likely that the daughter of the rich mister carlyle had wanted for offers other maidens confess to soft and tender impressions
not so miss carlyle all who had approached her with the lovelorn tale she sent quickly to the right about mister carlyle was seated in his own private room in his office the morning after his return from town his confidential clerk and manager stood near him
it was mister dill a little meek looking man with a bald head he was on the rolls had been admitted years and years ago but he had never set up for himself perhaps he deemed the post of head manager in the office of carlyle and davidson
with its substantial salary sufficient for his ambition and manager he had been to them when the present mister carlyle was in long petticoats he was a single man and occupied handsome apartments near
here he saw clients when mister carlyle was out or engaged and here he issued private orders a little window not larger than a pane of glass looked out from the clerks office they called it old dills peep hole and wished it anywhere else
for his spectacles might be discerned at it more frequently than was agreeable the old gentleman had a desk also in their office and there he frequently sat he was sitting there in state this same morning keeping a sharp lookout around him
when the door timidly opened and the pretty face of barbara hare appeared at it rosy with blushes can i see mister carlyle mister dill rose from his seat and shook hands with her she drew him into the passage and he closed the door perhaps he felt surprised
presently miss barbara he is engaged just now the justices are with him the justices uttered barbara in alarm and papa one whatever shall i do he must not see me i would not have him see me here for the world an ominous sound of talking
the justices were evidently coming forth mister dill laid hold of barbara whisked her through the clerks room not daring to take her the other way lest he should encounter them and shut her in his own what the plague brought papa here at this moment thought barbara whose face was crimson
who was not well enough to come herself it is a little private matter that she does not wish papa to know of child answered the manager a lawyer receives visits from many people and it is not the place of those about him to think he opened the door as he spoke
ushered her into the presence of mister carlyle and left her the latter rose in astonishment you must regard me as a client and pardon my intrusion said barbara with a forced laugh to hide her agitation i am here on the part of mamma
mister dill shut me into his room mister carlyle motioned to barbara to seat herself then resumed his own seat beside his table barbara could not help noticing how different his manners were in his office from his evening manners when he was off duty
she broke off with a look of dread it would be it might be death it is quite impossible calmly replied mister carlyle the doors are double doors did you notice that they were nevertheless she left her chair and stood close to mister carlyle
resting her hand upon the table he rose of course richard is here richard repeated mister carlyle at west lynne he appeared at the house last night in disguise and made signs to me from the grove of trees you may imagine my alarm
he has been in london all this while half starving working i feel ashamed to mention it to you in a stable yard and oh archibald he says he is innocent mister carlyle made no reply to this he probably had no faith in the assertion
sit down barbara he said drawing her chair closer barbara sat down again but her manner was hurried and nervous is it quite sure that no stranger will be coming in it would look so peculiar to see me here but mamma was too unwell to come herself
this room is sacred from the intrusion of strangers what of richard he says that he was not in the cottage at the time the murder was committed that the person who really did it was a man of the name of thorn what thorn asked mister carlyle
suppressing all signs of incredulity i dont know a friend of afys he said archibald he swore to it in the most solemn manner and i believe as truly as that i am now repeating it to you that he was speaking the truth
i want you to see richard if possible he is coming to the same place to night if he can tell his own tale to you perhaps you may find out a way by which his innocence may be made manifest you are so clever you can do anything mister carlyle smiled
not quite anything barbara was this the purport of richards visit to say this oh no he thinks it is of no use to say it for nobody would believe him against the evidence he came to ask for a hundred pounds
if he can have that sum mamma has sent me to you she has not the money by her and she dare not ask papa for it as it is for richard she bade me say that if you will kindly oblige her with the money to day she will arrange with you about the repayment
still if he is to be in the grove to night i may as well be there also what disguise is he in a farm laborers the best he could adopt about here with large black whiskers he is stopping about three miles off he said
in some obscure hiding place and now continued barbara i want you to advise me had i better inform mamma that richard is here or not
i should have premised that i have not yet told mamma it is richard himself who is here but that he has sent a messenger to beg for this money would it be advisable to acquaint her why should you not i think you ought to do so then i will
richard also wishes for an interview it is only natural missus hare must be thankful to hear so far that he is safe i never saw anything like it returned barbara the change is akin to magic she says it has put life into her anew and now for the last thing
how can we secure papas absence from home to night it must be accomplished in some way you know his temper were i or mamma to suggest to him to go and see some friend or to go to the club he would immediately stop at home can you devise any plan
you see i appeal to you in all my troubles she added like i and anne used to do when we were children it may be questioned if mister carlyle heard the last remark he had dropped his eyelids in thought have you told me all he asked presently lifting them
contrive to be in the street at four this afternoon stay thats your dinner hour be walking up the street at three three precisely i will meet you he rose shook hands and escorted barbara through the small hall along the passage to the house door
a courtesy probably not yet shown to any client by mister carlyle the house door closed upon her and barbara had taken one step from it when something large loomed down upon her like a ship in full sail
have you been with archibald for barbara hare wishing miss carlyle over in asia stammered out the excuse she had given mister dill your mamma sent you on business i never heard of such a thing twice i have been to see archibald
and twice did dill answer that he was engaged and must not be interrupted i shall make old dill explain his meaning for observing a mystery over it to me there is no mystery answered barbara feeling quite sick lest miss carlyle should proclaim there was
before the clerks or her father mamma wanted mister carlyles opinion upon a little private business and not feeling well enough to come herself she sent me
it is nothing that could interest you a trifling matter relating to a little money its nothing indeed then if its nothing why were you closeted so long with archibald he was asking the particulars replied barbara recovering her equanimity
when dissenting from a problem she was sure there was some mystery astir she turned and walked down the street with barbara
mister carlyle returned to his room deliberated a few moments and then rang his bell a clerk answered it go to the bucks head if mister hare and the other magistrates are there ask them to step over to me the young man did as he was bid
and came back with the noted justices at his heels they obeyed the summons with alacrity for they believed they had got themselves into a judicial scrape and that mister carlyle alone could get them out of it i will not request you to sit down began mister carlyle
for it is barely a moment i shall detain you the more i think about this mans having been put in prison the less i like it and i have been considering that you had better all five come and smoke your pipes at my house this evening when we shall have time to discuss what must be done
come at seven not later and you will find my fathers old jar replenished with the best broadcut and half a dozen churchwarden pipes shall it be so the whole five accepted the invitation eagerly
sure and certain responded the gratified justice fire and water shouldnt keep me away soon after mister carlyle was left alone another clerk entered miss carlyle is asking to see you sir and colonel bethels come again
send in miss carlyle first was the answer what is it cornelia ah you may well ask what saying this morning that you could not dine at six as usual and then marching off and never fixing the hour
i will talk to you at dinner time i have invited a party for to night a party echoed miss carlyle four or five of the justices are coming in to smoke their pipes you must put out your fathers leaden tobacco box and
dropping the point of the contest as to the pipes you are very clever archie but you cant do me i asked barbara what she came here for business for mamma touching money matters was her reply i ask you
to hear your opinion about the scrape the bench have got into is yours now its neither one nor the other and i tell you archibald ill hear what it is i should like to know what you and barbara do with a secret between you mister carlyle knew her and her resolute expression well
and he took his course to tell her the truth she was to borrow the words barbara had used to her brother with regard to him true as steel confide to miss carlyle a secret and she was trustworthy and impervious as he could be
and she would set to work like a ferret and never stop until it was unearthed mister carlyle bent forward and spoke in a whisper i will tell you if you wish cornelia but it is not a pleasant thing to hear richard hare has returned
miss carlyle looked perfectly aghast richard hare is he mad it is not a very sane proceeding he wants money from his mother and missus hare sent barbara to ask me to manage it for her
no wonder poor barbara was flurried and nervous for theres danger on all sides is he at their house how could he be there and his father in it
and will be at the grove to night to receive this money i have invited the justices to get mister hare safe away from his own house
and putting graver considerations aside that would be pleasant for neither you nor for me to have a connection gibbeted for a willful murder would be an ugly blot on the carlyle escutcheon cornelia
now miss corny in so speaking had certainly no thought of present and immediate punishment for the gentleman but it appeared that the mob around had the motion was commented by those stout shouldered laborers
or whether their own feelings alone spurred them on was best known to the men themselves certain it is that the ominous sound of duck him was breathed forth by a voice and it was caught up and echoed around duck him
duck him the pond be close at hand lets give him a taste of his deservings
turn himself up at west lynne for bearding mister carlyle what have he done with lady isabel him put up for others at west lynne west lynnes respectable it dont want him it have got a better man it wont have a villain now lads
his face turned white and he trembled in his shoes worthless men are frequently cowards lady isabel trembled in hers and well she might hearing that one allusion they set upon him twenty pairs of hands at least strong rough determined hands
not to speak of the tagrags help who went in with cuffs and kicks and pokes and taunts and cheers and a demoniac dance they dragged him through a gap in the hedge a gap that no baby could have got through in a cool moment but most of us know the difference between coolness and excitement
was the promise held out in reply to their remonstrances and the lawyer who was short and fat and could not have knocked a man down had it been to save his life backed out of the melee and contented himself with issuing forth confused threatenings of the terrors of the law
miss carlyle stood her ground majestically and looked on with a grim countenance had she interfered for his protection she could not have been heard and if she could have been theres no knowing whether she would have done it on to the brink of the pond
a green dank dark slimy sour stinking pond his coat tails were gone by this time and sundry rents and damages appeared in in another useful garment one pulled him another pushed him a third shook him by the collar
half a dozen buffeted him and all abused him in with him boys mercy mercy shrieked the victim his knees bending and his teeth chattering a little mercy for the love of heaven heaven much he knows of heaven
going down his throat by bucketfuls a hoarse derisive laugh and a hip hip hurrah broke from the actors while the juvenile ragtag in wild delight joined their hands round the pool
they had never had such a play acted for them before out of the pea soup before he was quite dead quite senseless of all drowned rats he looked the worst as he stood there with his white rueful face
his shivery limbs and his dilapidated garments shaking the wet off him the laborers their duty done walked coolly away the tagrag withdrew to a safe distance waiting for what might come next and miss carlyle moved away also
she sailed on with her head up though it was turned occasionally to look at the face of madame vine at the deep distressing blush which this gaze called into her cheeks its very odd thought miss corny the likeness especially in the eyes is
where are you going madame they were passing a spectacle shop and madame vine had halted at the door one foot on its step i must have my glasses to be mended if you please miss carlyle followed her in
she pointed out what she wanted done to the old glasses and said she would buy a pair of new ones to wear while the job was about the man had no blue ones no green plenty of white one ugly old pair of green things he had
with tortoise shell rims left by some stranger ages and ages ago to be mended and never called for again this very pair of ugly old green things was chosen by lady isabel she put them on there and then
miss carlyles eyes searching her face inquisitively all the time why do you wear glasses began miss corny abruptly as soon as they were indoors another deep flush and an imperceptible hesitation my eyes are not strong
they look as strong as eyes can look but why wear colored glasses white ones would answer every purpose i should suppose
miss corny paused what is your christian name madame began she again jane replied madame popping out an unflinching story in her alarm here here whats up whats this
miss corny flew to the window lady isabel in her wake two crowds it may almost be said for from the opposite way the scarlet and purple party as mister carlyles was called in allusion to his colors came in view
quite a collection of gentlemen mister carlyle and lord mount severn heading them what could it mean the mob they were encountering
who or what was that object in advance of it supported between drake and the lawyer and looking like a drowned rat hair hanging legs tottering cheeks shaking and clothes in tatters
while the mob behind had swollen to the length of the street and was keeping up a perpetual fire of derisive shouts groans and hisses the scarlet and purple halted in consternation and lord mount severn whose sight was not as good as it had been twenty years back
stuck his pendent eye glasses astride on the bridge of his nose sir francis levison could it be yes it actually was what on earth had put him into that state
mister carlyles lip curled he continued his way and drew the peer with him what the deuce is a gate now called out the followers of mister carlyle thats levison has he been in a railway smash and got drenched by the engine
he has been ducked grinned the yellows in answer they have been and ducked him in the rush pool on mister justice hares land the soaked and miserable man increased his speed as much as his cold and trembling legs would allow him
he would have borne on without legs at all rather than remain under the enemys gaze the enemy loftily continued their way their heads in the air and scorning further notice all save young lord vane he hovered round the ranks of the unwashed
and looked vastly inclined to enter upon an indian jig on his own account what a thundering ass i was to try it on at west lynne was the enraged comment of the sufferer
miss carlyle laid her hand upon the shrinking arm of her pale companion you see him my brother archibald i see him faltered lady isabel and you see him that pitiful outcast who is too contemptible to live
you may wonder that the submerged gentleman should be walking through the streets on his way to his quarters the raven inn for he had been ejected from the bucks head but he could not help himself as he was dripping and swearing on the brink of the pond
wondering how he should get to the raven an empty fly drove past and mister drake immediately stopped it but when the driver saw that he was expected to convey not only a passenger but a tolerable quantity of water as well and that the passenger moreover was sir francis levison
and that the shortest way would be to hasten to the inn on foot he objected but his jaws were chattering his limbs were quaking so they seized him between them and made off but never bargained for the meeting of mister carlyle and his party
francis levison would have stopped in the pond of his own accord head downward rather than face them miss carlyle went that day to dine at east lynne
lord vane found them out and returned at the same time of course east lynne was the headquarters of himself and his father he was in the seventh heaven and had been ever since the encounter with the yellows
youd have gone into laughing convulsions lucy had you seen the drowned cur id give all my tin for six months to come to have a photograph of him as he looked then lucy laughed in glee
when miss carlyle was in her dressing room taking her things off the room where once had slept richard hare she rang for joyce these two rooms were still kept for miss carlyle for she did sometimes visit them for a few days and were distinguished by her name
miss carlyles rooms a fine row we have had in the town joyce this afternoon i have heard of it maam served him right if they had let him drown bill white squire pinners plowman called in here and told us the news hed have burst with it if he hadnt i expect
i never saw a chap so excited peter cried cried echoed miss carlyle well maam you know he was very fond of lady isabel was peter and somehow his feelings overcame him he said he had not heard anything to please him so much for many a day
and with that he burst out crying and gave bill white half a crown out of his pocket
afy saw it if youll excuse me mentioning her name to you maam
she was coming here with a message from missus latimer to the governess what did she go into hysterics for again snapped miss carlyle it upset her so she said returned joyce it wouldnt have done her harm had they ducked her too was the angry response
joyce was silent to contradict miss corny brought triumph to nobody and she was conscious in her innermost heart that afy merited a little wholesome correction not perhaps to the extent of a ducking
maam repeated joyce in some surprise as it appeared the governess do you mean madame vine do i mean you or do i mean me are we governesses irascibly cried miss corny who should i mean but madame vine
she turned herself round from the looking glass and gazed full in joyces face waiting for the answer joyce lowered her voice as she gave it
and i can tell you joyce that i was confounded at the likeness it is an extraordinary likeness
that evening after dinner miss carlyle and lord mount severn sat side by side on the same sofa coffee cups in hand miss carlyle turned to the earl was it a positively ascertained fact that lady isabel died the earl stared with all his might
he thought it the strangest question that ever was asked him i scarcely understand you miss carlyle died certainly she died when the result of the accident was communicated to you you made inquiry yourself into its truth its details i believe
it was my duty to do so there was no one else to undertake it did you ascertain positively beyond all doubt that she did die
a pause miss carlyle was ruminating but she returned to the charge as if difficult to be convinced you deem that there could be no possibility of an error you are sure that she is dead
i am as sure that she is dead as that we are living decisively replied the earl and he spoke but according to his belief wherefore should you be inquiring this a thought came over me only to day to wonder whether she was really dead
had any error occurred at that time any false report of her death i should soon have found it out by her drawing the annuity i settled upon her it has never been drawn since besides she would have written to me as agreed upon
no poor thing she is gone beyond all doubt and has taken her sins with her convincing proofs and miss carlyle lent her ear to them the following morning while madame vine was at breakfast mister carlyle entered
do you admit intruders here madame vine cried he with his sweet smile and attractive manner she arose her face burning her heart throbbing keep your seat pray i have but a moment to stay said mister carlyle
i have come to ask you how william seems there was no difference she murmured and then she took courage and spoke more openly i understood you to say the other night sir that he should have further advice ay i wish him to go over to lynneborough to doctor martin
the drive i think will do him good replied mister carlyle and i would like you to accompany him if you do not mind the trouble you can have the pony carriage
you can remind doctor martin that the childs constitution is precisely what his mothers was continued mister carlyle a tinge lightening his face it may be a guide to his treatment he said himself it was when he attended him for an illness a year or two ago
yes sir he crossed the hall on his entrance to the breakfast room she tore upstairs to her chamber and sank down in an agony of tears and despair oh to love him as she did now to yearn after his affection with this passionate jealous longing
and to know that they were separated for ever and ever that she was worse to him than nothing
chapter seventeen the abbes chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor
into which the abbes cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees the floor of the abbes cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner
of which dantes had witnessed the completion as he entered the chamber of his friend dantes cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view it is well
said the abbe we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve oclock instinctively dantes turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbe had been able so accurately to specify the hour
look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbe and then observe the lines traced on the wall well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun
than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantes who had always imagined
appeared to him perfectly impossible each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda
which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth
i am anxious to see your treasures the abbe smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth
serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantes
asked the abbe oh your great work on the monarchy of italy
laid one over the other like folds of papyrus these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantes could easily read it
as well as make out the sense it being in italian
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dantes
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look
showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread
and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen dantes examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form ah yes said faria the penknife
one could cut and thrust dantes examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles
as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels as for the ink
i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dantes and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight
night why for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions
i furnished myself with a light
i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp so saying the abbe exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations
and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied dantes laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast
as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place let us shut this one up
they put the stone back in its place the abbe sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle
so that i have been able to finish my work here and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed
i hemmed the edges over again with what with this needle said the abbe as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantes a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it
i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight
however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder
and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantes was in fact busily occupied by the idea
that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbe might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing
what are you thinking of asked the abbe smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder i was reflecting in the first place replied dantes
upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably
in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect compression is needed to explode gunpowder captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus
and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination no replied dantes i know nothing
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbe smiled well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did
as yet but one of them let me hear the other it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven
my father and mercedes come said the abbe closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantes obeyed and commenced what he called his history
but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal
his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercedes and their nuptual feast
his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the chateau dif from this point everything was a blank to dantes he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned
catherine was completely awakened henrys address short as it had been had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done
most bitterly did she cry it was not only with herself that she was sunk but with henry her folly which now seemed even criminal was all exposed to him and he must despise her forever
the liberty which her imagination had dared to take with the character of his father could he ever forgive it the absurdity of her curiosity and her fears could they ever be forgotten
she hated herself more than she could express he had she thought he had once or twice before this fatal morning shown something like affection for her but now
in short she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour went down when the clock struck five with a broken heart and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to eleanors inquiry if she was well
the formidable henry soon followed her into the room and the only difference in his behaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual catherine had never wanted comfort more and he looked as if he was aware of it
the evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity she did not learn either to forget or defend the past
but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther and that it might not cost her henrys entire regard her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done nothing could shortly be clearer
than that it had been all a voluntary self created delusion each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which
long before her quitting bath and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had there indulged
charming as were all missus radcliffes works and charming even as were the works of all her imitators it was not in them perhaps that human nature at least in the midland counties of england was to be looked for
and even of that if hard pressed would have yielded the northern and western extremities but in the central part of england there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved in the laws of the land and the manners of the age
murder was not tolerated servants were not slaves and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured like rhubarb from every druggist among the alps and pyrenees perhaps there were no mixed characters
there such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend but in england it was not so among the english she believed in their hearts and habits
upon this conviction she would not be surprised if even in henry and eleanor tilney some slight imperfection might hereafter appear
and upon this conviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of their father who though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained she did believe
upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable her mind made up on these several points and her resolution formed of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense
she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day henrys astonishing generosity
and nobleness of conduct in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed was of the greatest assistance to her and sooner than she could have supposed it possible in the beginning of her distress her spirits became absolutely comfortable
and capable as heretofore of continual improvement by anything he said there were still some subjects indeed under which she believed they must always tremble the mention of a chest or a cabinet for instance
and she did not love the sight of japan in any shape but even she could allow that an occasional memento of past folly however painful might not be without use
the anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance her desire of hearing from isabella grew every day greater she was quite impatient to know how the bath world went on and how the rooms were attended
and especially was she anxious to be assured of isabellas having matched some fine netting cotton on which she had left her intent and of her continuing on the best terms with james
her only dependence for information of any kind was on isabella james had protested against writing to her till his return to oxford and missus allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back to fullerton
she thanked him as heartily as if he had written it himself tis only from james however as she looked at the direction she opened it it was from oxford and to this purpose dear catherine
though god knows with little inclination for writing i think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between miss thorpe and me i left her and bath yesterday never to see either again
i shall not enter into particulars they would only pain you more you will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame
thank god i am undeceived in time but it is a heavy blow after my fathers consent had been so kindly given but no more of this she has made me miserable forever
let me soon hear from you dear catherine you are my only friend your love i do build upon i wish your visit at northanger may be over before captain tilney makes his engagement known
or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced poor thorpe is in town i dread the sight of him his honest heart would feel so much i have written to him and my father her duplicity hurts me more than all
till the very last if i reasoned with her she declared herself as much attached to me as ever
i am ashamed to think how long i bore with it but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved i was that man i cannot understand even now
what she would be at for there could be no need of my being played off to make her secure of tilney we parted at last by mutual consent happy for me had we never met
dearest catherine beware how you give your heart
and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder declared her to be receiving unpleasant news and henry earnestly watching her through the whole letter saw plainly that it ended no better than it began he was prevented however
from even looking his surprise by his fathers entrance they went to breakfast directly but catherine could hardly eat anything tears filled her eyes and even ran down her cheeks as she sat the letter was one moment in her hand
then in her lap and then in her pocket and she looked as if she knew not what she did the general between his cocoa and his newspaper had luckily no leisure for noticing her but to the other two her distress was equally visible
as soon as she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room but the housemaids were busy in it and she was obliged to come down again she turned into the drawing room for privacy but henry and eleanor had likewise retreated thither
and were at that moment deep in consultation about her she drew back trying to beg their pardon but was with gentle violence forced to return and the others withdrew
after eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her after half an hours free indulgence of grief and reflection catherine felt equal to encountering her friends
such a friend as isabella had been to her and then their own brother so closely concerned in it she believed she must waive the subject altogether henry and eleanor were by themselves in the breakfast room and each as she entered it
looked at her anxiously catherine took her place at the table and after a short silence eleanor said no bad news from fullerton i hope mister and missus morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill
no i thank you sighing as she spoke they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford nothing further was said for a few minutes and then speaking through her tears she added
i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again i am sorry said henry closing the book he had just opened if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister replied henry warmly must be a comfort to him under any distress
i have one favour to beg said catherine shortly afterwards in an agitated manner that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away our brother frederick yes
i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney eleanors work was suspended while she gazed with increasing astonishment
but henry began to suspect the truth and something in which miss thorpes name was included passed his lips how quick you are cried catherine you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath
you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness
and everything that is bad in the world i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mister morlands disappointment
his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mister morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater
will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother no read it yourself cried catherine whose second thoughts were clearer i do not know what i was thinking of blushing again that she had blushed before
james only means to give me good advice he gladly received the letter and having read it through with close attention returned it saying well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it
frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son miss tilney
at catherines invitation now read the letter likewise and having expressed also her concern and surprise began to inquire into miss thorpes connections and fortune her mother is a very good sort of woman was catherines answer
what was her father a lawyer i believe they live at putney are they a wealthy family no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family
would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on fredericks side a girl
inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly
it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid
artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise such a sister in law henry i should delight in said eleanor with a smile
but perhaps observed catherine though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
indeed i am afraid she will replied henry i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is fredericks only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more
i never was so deceived in anyones character in my life before among all the great variety that you have known and studied my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james
i suppose he will hardly ever recover it your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella
you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent
you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel
that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again
what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves
chapter seven the timely rescue it was no pleasant thought to contemplate the presence of a bold
that he was capable of going any lengths if necessary already had been proved and the evidence of his evil genius might come in horrible form at any instant nevertheless
was sufficient to prevent jerry and slim from taking a full eight hours of much needed sleep while lieutenant mackinson joe and three other officers whom the captain had taken into his confidence in the matter followed out every possible clue in pursuit of a solution of the baffling mystery
it was a case of watch everybody take every precaution and be prepared for anything only nine men on the vessel however including the spy himself knew anything about it
refreshed by their sleep jerry and slim arose about four oclock that afternoon joe who had rested easily throughout the later excitement of the preceding night was still in the midst of the investigation and was not then to be found
jerry had some letters to write so slim went to the upper deck alone
and his mind weighted anyway with the menacing mystery of the strange happenings of the night before he sat down on a coil of rope just in the lee of the forward smokestack to think the whole matter over for the twentieth time he was thus absorbed when something at first vague and indefinite then clearer
like the awakening call that comes to a man in a sound sleep
to find someone standing directly over him loudly and insistently calling his name
a crackling merely from the pressure within for a moment slim thought an over wrought imagination was playing tricks upon him but he rose hastily and crossed the short intervening distance
was rapping desperately upon that pipe and in the long and short dashes of the international code that someone was repeating a single word help help help in another instant using the heavy end of his jackknife as a crude transmitter slim was tapping off the reply
who are you and where lieutenant mackinson the message began to come back
cant make self heard can you help this is slim the youth rapped back upon the pipe caught your message on deck am coming with help at once and he dashed down the deck toward the captains quarters almost bowling over the captains aide as he hurtled into the sanctum of the ships commander unannounced
well the captain demanded sternly why all the haste lieutenant mackinson slim blurted out hes locked in a closet down near the engine room locked in a closet the captain repeated incredulously how do you know
he gave a telegraphic call for help on the steam pipe which runs through there and connects with the whistle the lad explained i was on deck and heard it i talked with him over the pipe there is no time to lose then come with me and the captain himself hurriedly led the way down through the lower depths of the ship
for a few steps they felt their way along and then stopped to listen there was nothing but the dull and constant hum of the engines and the almost insufferable heat
they stood silent a moment and then faint and indistinct apparently from somewhere several feet ahead of them they both heard repeated that which had made slim stop
the lad repeated them for the information of the captain
m o t h e r i n g
and he started down the passageway toward a narrow stairs leading to a still lower chamber in the vessel three turns two to the right and one to the left and the captain stopped again to listen seemingly from within the wall right at their elbows there came a feeble knock
the officer whipped out a pocket flashlight they were directly in front of a heavy wooden door it was locked
and slim hastened away to return two minutes later with all three tools
but there was no response from within
two more attempts and the panel fell in strips to the floor thus given something for a grip hold the captain who was a massive man took hold with both hands
brought the entire door from its hinges
the unconscious form of lieutenant mackinson tumbled out upon the floor his face was almost blue from suffocation the captain sounded three short sharp blasts upon a whistle which he had taken from his pocket and two oilers came running to the spot
help us carry this man to fresh air immediately he ordered he has been overcome
he had relapsed again and there was another wait of several minutes but this time the lieutenants mind was clearing somebody shoved me in that closet he gasped and then slammed and locked the door he recognized the captain and the doctor
found him locked in a small compartment down near the auxiliary engine room the commander said briefly
he made his whereabouts known by tapping a message on a steam pipe
nearly suffocated too
his heart action is pretty weak even yet
at that moment jerry came hurrying down the deck he was visibly excited but
and so even as two men carried lieutenant mackinson away he remained standing at salute waiting for the captain to recognize him with a return of the salute and now what asked the captain jerry stepped forward with difficulty repressing his excitement
when i returned i found this lying upon the table he opened his left hand in it lay a piece of light chain both ends broken beside it he continued was this note from his pocket he extracted a piece of paper the edges of which were roughly torn
let this be a warning that no further interference will be of avail the captain looked from the note to the chain
and no signature i believe sir said jerry
the senior officer of the vessel took from his pocket the cross with its two bits of chain still dangling from it he placed the ends to the chain which jerry had found in the wireless room you are right he said simply and there could be no doubt about it
appeared equally anxious a man is discovered at night in the battery room of the wireless department of this ship clearly upon an unfriendly mission said the captain half to himself and half for the benefit of the others summing up the evidence thus far known to them
a few hours later that same night he returns to the battery room and succeeds in recovering the portable instrument to day lieutenant mackinson while pursuing an investigation of the affair
is shoved into a closet and only escapes death from suffocation by making himself heard as he telegraphs for help over a steam pipe it must have been while we were rescuing the lieutenant that the same man again enters the wireless room and leaves there this chain
we are not safe while he is free
chapter eight the death of the spy
the young lieutenant it seemed had been following a trail which he believed was leading him closer and closer to the object of the hunt and it was in forging the links of this chain of circumstantial evidence that the young officer was led into the lower depths of the ship
presumably from the engine or boiler room throw aside something as he hurried along the passageway leading from the wireless room
and you stooped to pick up whatever it was that had been thrown away
evidently also from the boiler or engine room brushed by us he had disappeared when the sailor said to me i think that was the fellow the one that just went by not wanting to arouse his suspicions i ended the conversation with a casual remark and then strolled away until i was out of the sailors sight
i was groping my way along when i thought i heard steps just ahead of me i stopped to listen and when the sound was not repeated i proceeded onward
before i could utter a word i was a prisoner behind a locked door i called several times and
every moment it became more stifling in there and i had no doubt that i had walked directly into a death trap it was then i began signaling on the steam pipe i guess it was a mighty lucky thing for me that slim goodwin strolled out on deck just at the time he did
and that was all that lieutenant mackinson could tell the mysterious stranger remained what he had been from the first a desperate and dangerous and unknown spy
put their heads together to devise a scheme of capture weve got more than one good reason for wanting to get this fellow slim reminded the others with considerable warmth
to which he is an enemy and a traitor but in addition to that there is that knockout that he handed to joe and the midnight scare he gave jerry and me and finally his effort to kill lieutenant mackinson by slow suffocation
well said joe i think ive got a plan that will work but
well whats your suggestion slim demanded that we divide our forces answered joe solemnly lie in wait and try to ambush the foe right cried jerry joe youll be a general before this wars over
along what lines do we disperse our forces general asked slim along what lines would his royal stoutness suggest demanded jerry oh you dont have to keep reminding me that im a trifle heavy slim replied in a peevish tone
a trifle heavy get that will you echoed jerry with a gale of laughter a trifle heavy oh my youll find out if i sit on you slim threatened in a belligerent tone
wont do it slim muttered oh yes you will counseled joe shake hands the two of you slims good nature overcame his feigned reluctance but as jerry grasped his hand he gave jerry a jerk that nearly took him off his feet now were square said slim
and to do that he will have to use the wireless somehow it seems likely that he would make his effort at night
the lieutenant could be in the wireless room and one of us in the battery room while the other two did duty outside
it would be tiresome and monotonous work all right
im willing said jerry but you and i will have to do the outside work
well ill cover the battery room said slim ignoring jerrys remark lets see lieutenant mackinson then suggested joe and they went to find the young officer who was convalescing from his encounter with the spy when he had approved the plan they got the o k of the captain
to the three boys unable to see or talk to each other and joe and jerry scarcely daring to move the minutes lagged like hours
black endless nights dawn came
there were mutual feelings of disappointment but none of weakened determination what luck
i will arrange for another man to stay in the wireless room during to day
the sea is calm and we readily could discern a periscope a long distance away truly it was a beautiful night and it was in this alluring quiet of seemingly absolute peace
the brighton boys and their friend and superior officer the lieutenant had been in their appointed places hardly more than an hour when joe and jerry at the same instant caught the sounds of some sort of scuffle on the deck above
it came nearer and clearer until finally as it reached a point near to the top of the stairway under which joe was concealed the latter could discern the fog horn voice of the first assistant engineer
the first assistant engineer was a mighty mountain of a man but his voice broke off as the commotion started again certainly he must have a rough customer to deal with thought jerry
ye will will ye hissed the voice of the engineer again
ye dirty hound ive a mind to boot ye into the sea
and whin i asked him what he was about
so said the captain in a voice so stern it made joe wince
hes a third class machinist sir the engineer replied
yes and i believe hes worse than that the captain added
there was a strained silence for a moment then
it looks as though wed caught the man the doctor whispered
there was a gasp of astonishment from joe followed by a louder holy smoke from slim do you recognize this man the captain asked in a sharp tone i should say i do sir joe responded
he is the man who was planting ammunition in the waters near the navy yard that night before we sailed the very same one sir slim exclaimed with equal positiveness the ships surgeon who had followed the others upon deck stepped closer for a better inspection of this enemy
at the same instant the prisoner
and thrust the engineer from him before anyone could interfere he was dashing down the deck toward the stern just as he took a wild headlong leap over the rail the captain fired while the captain through a speaking tube was instructing the man in the pilot house to signal below reverse engines
the others rushed to the stern of the ship far behind them in the foamy trail left on the moonlit water by the vessel they saw what seemed to be the head of a man bobbing up and down and then it entirely disappeared the ship was turned
gone said the captain in tones of very evident relief well it was death for him one way or another and he took his choice as the captain and surgeon moved away from the stern rail of the everett
and made me run a mile in nothing flat added jerry and fought me to a knockout finish later mused joe and nearly smothered me to death spoke the lieutenant and was finally corralled by an irish engineer said slim gone concluded jerry
the following morning all of those who had arrived on the transports were established in a concentration camp but it was merely for the purpose of inspection of men and equipment and was not to be for long
it was that same day that the three boys from brighton were for the first time assigned to a regular unit of the signal corps also with a real thrill they learned that they were almost immediately to see war service for american troops were already in the trenches
his three assistants on the trip across were the first ones named the other two were tom rawle a fellow proportioned like their first friend in the service sergeant martin and a wiry energetic quick speaking youth named frank hoskins
we have a long trip before us lieutenant mackinson informed them and we leave here on a special train in two hours in a short time we will be in the thick of it
knowing they have important work to do and feeling capable of doing it well
got here two weeks ago the big fellow answered
did you get within sound of the big guns asked slim excitedly i should say so answered tom rawle and so will you within a few hours isnt that so hoskins yes answered frank
hoskins knows explained rawle for he got nearer than i did only for a short time frank corrected modestly but they called it my baptism of fire i was out one night with an advance party we were nearly ambushed and had to beat a quick retreat
well tell them all about it demanded tom rawle impatient at franks unwillingness to talk much about himself
and it was a surprise party for fair i can tell you
then we all dropped on our stomachs and wriggled our way back into our own lines without any further damage but we did some rapid wriggling you can bet there wasnt any time wasted by any of us and inasmuch as we were apparently outnumbered
say that must be thrilling to be a member of an advance party like that said jerry his enthusiasm as fiery as his hair i wonder if well get any work like that you sure will responded rawle and plenty of it you neednt worry on that score
all ready they answered and the lieutenant led the way to the train
also there was a wire company of the signal corps which was going to join another american unit for the first three or four hours of the trip the lads
and from them they heard many serious and amusing stories many true tales of the attack and retreat of shot and shell and shrapnel and the hand grenade and the poisonous gas bombs thrown by the boches and then one by one the soldiers of uncle sam dropped off into long
and restful slumber slumber that was to fit them for hard and difficult duties ahead this is where we get off finally announced lieutenant mackinson shaking the lads into wakefulness
without the waste of a moment they climbed in lieutenant mackinson our three friends young hoskins and the towering rawle in another instant they were speeding across the country with the break of dawn
where in that country they had seen big concentration camps and
in the eastern part of france they came upon actual war in all its fateful progress with whole towns demolished forests and orchards blotted out stark ruin written over the face of the earth
long strings of powerful motor trucks driving toward the scene of action they came upon towns and villages in that area known as behind the lines where french american belgian and british soldiers were recuperating after hard days and nights in the front line trenches
by this time they were well within sound of the heavy guns and their driver told them that the artillery duel then going on had been in progress for forty eight hours at least
in preparation for a great infantry advance but i understand that this time they expect to go forward before the end of to day which means added lieutenant mackinson
on and on they went and nearer and nearer to the scene of actual battle they came they passed the third line trenches and now in places they seemed to be in a straight line with some of the concealed artillery
that was pounding away at the enemy in terrible detonations that shook and rocked the ground every minute at the second line trenches their orders called for a halt they did not have to be told that there was something doing
was a constantly moving line of motor trucks coming forward with men and shells while out ahead of them tremendous and menacing big tanks
were pursuing their uneven course toward the front in preparation for a new kind of assault they look like miniature battleships on land dont they exclaimed slim
equipped with guns and men that could travel with their own power practically anywhere across shell holes over trenches through barbed wire
await me here he said to the five men under his immediate command
and the latter immediately began a quick examination of his engine and tires which promised another early move we go forward as far as we can by automobile again the lieutenant informed them
and after dark to night we are to establish an outlying communication from the farthest skirmish points to headquarters almost as he finished the sentence they were started
joe remarked upon it in tones of open admiration its nothing the youthful chauffeur replied youll get used to it too as he turned the automobile and started backward slim suddenly remembered that they hadnt even heard his name dont know it said hoskins
they had been directed to the quarters of major jones in charge of the signal corps men in that section and it was with considerable surprise that the boys learned upon arriving there that they were to accompany the lieutenant into the superior officers presence for instructions
he was a man they found about forty years old already grizzled and hardened by his field experience and he knew how to convey orders and transact business without a moments delay you are to follow the red ink lines on this map he told lieutenant mackinson
as they all leaned over his desk to follow the tracing of his pencil with which he showed them the course they were to take
you will seek a suitable location from which to establish communications you will determine whether it can be done by wireless as soon as you can do so report what progress you have made use every caution for you will be in the country occupied by the enemy
you should leave here about seven oclock this evening it is now six fifteen minutes later they had examined their arms and equipped themselves with a full supply of small arms ammunition portable wireless instrument and antennae and three rations each of eating chocolate
and if wounded might otherwise starve to death
and promptly at seven oclock they started upon the dangerous mission with nightfall the big cannonading had noticeably shut down
it was a black night and they proceeded with the greatest caution they did not dare use the flashlights that each of them carried and frequently all of them would have to drop suddenly flat upon the ground as a big rocket went up from either side
in this way they went forward yard by yard until they reached a thick clump of trees there after listening intently for several minutes without hearing a dangerous sound they spread out their coats tent like while lieutenant mackinson with gingerly flashes of his light
examined the map again to make certain of their location
while tom rawle quietly chuckling at the fat lads misfortune aided him to his feet down flat said mackinson again as he discerned several shadows moving across a space a considerable distance to the north of them
for fully ten minutes which seemed like an hour they lay there not daring to move they watched the enemy scouting party get a like scare and then after what seemed to be a whispered consultation turn back to the german lines
what did you fall over the lieutenant finally asked of slim in a scarcely audible tone i just found it replied slim
copper exclaimed the lieutenant hoskins let me have that kit
a very small telegraph instrument the instant it was attached to the wire the receiver began to tick irregularly neither rawle nor hoskins understood german but to the others they were words easy to translate they had accidentally struck an enemy wire and had tapped it
lead enemy to believe whole attack centered from your position
frank hoskins elbow wound healed quickly without any serious results and tom rawle who had been under treatment at the field hospital was able to get about the camp
but on the eighth day a veritable fury launched itself upon that section of the american french front in the shape of seemingly endless brigades of boches that were hurled over the top of their own breastworks across no mans land and upon the first line trenches of the allies
for several days the american and french aviators had been reporting heavy german formations in that region evidently with the design of a terrific assault but the allied commanders had not expected it so soon and in truth they were not fully prepared for it
it was a surprise attack in every sense of the word with all the terrible carnage that such a battle brings
and their hidden artillery to the rear of them this was kept up for about seven hours and the duel of heavy guns shook the earth like a quake and was deafening then just as dawn was breaking the infantry onslaught
including food and ammunition trains
everything moved like clockwork and with the greatest possible speed and throughout it all men on both sides were shooting shouting shrieking
or lifeless before superior numbers
a stationary balloon showed where jerry and an observation officer were doing duty on that fateful day jerry was operating a telephone that ran directly to division headquarters and hardly a moment passed when he was not repeating some observation of the other man in the basket with him
every detail of that tremendous battle jerry knew his own occasional glimpses over the side informed him of the temporary reverses his own army was suffering while the remarks of the officer told him where the germans were meeting their bitterest repulses
where they were drawing up their heaviest forces of reserves what quick changes were being made in their general line of formation and how far back their forces seemed to extend slim goodwin
to make sure that thus far his friend was still safe
the wavering swaying target was watched from time to time and speculations made as to how long it could remain without being punctured by a bullet
it was now well into the afternoon the germans had swept into the places vacated by the americans and french and still the battle raged it was now that slim began to wait anxiously for the new development
the americans and french had retreated to a general line which permitted a quick re mobilization to the best advantage there their front line ranks held firm while the new formation was being effected behind them it was about four oclock in the afternoon when this was complete
and soon in great measure at least hostilities would be suspended for the night their work completed
so you can judge pretty well for yourself guess he had a pretty good birds eye view of the whole thing said joe as they passed on to meet again before mess except for spasmodic outbursts here and there the trench duel had almost entirely subsided
and the heavy roar of the artillery also was punctuated with longer pauses
while each side took account of stock and made necessary repairs or altered their plans to meet the new situation our young friends were busy with wash basin soap and water
taking off the grime in preparation for the evening meal and wondering where jerry was keeping himself all the while when suddenly a very strange thing happened beyond the enemys line
more easily handled aeroplanes and used in great numbers by the germans shot into the air at great speed from behind the boche entrenchments
it simply indicated that those manning the american and french anti aircraft guns
and even this might have been considered a well designed hoax
still going at maximum speed and now on a straight line toward the american side without seeking a further height the taube several times wavered and a moment later almost turned over but the pilot righted her
he pointed her nose downward toward the american lines four american planes sailed off and upward to meet the oncoming german air armada but from the ground it could be seen that the man in the observers place in the taube was making desperate signals
the american planes maneuvered in such a way as to encircle the taube
and the other german planes turned back toward their own lines the taube continued on its wavering crippled downward course toward the allied lines
as the taube came within a hundred yards of the ground and righted herself for a landing
of its own momentum it rolled to within a two minutes run of where the lieutenant and the others had been standing in another instant it was entirely surrounded by a crowd of curious american soldiers
and after descending a little by permitting some of the gas to escape we jumped over the side of the basket and came down on our parachutes
but some other german aviators saw the affair apparently recognized our uniforms and hardly gave us time to make a decent start say jerry concluded they certainly did pebble us with machine gun bullets
opening them the boys could hardly suppress their jubilation stripped of their official verbiage the letters informed the young men that each of them was made a corporal joe for valorous service in saving the lives of three americans entombed in a cave
the winter which preceded the entrance of the united states into the war was socially an extraordinary one it was marked by an almost feverish gayety as though having apparently determined to pursue a policy dictated purely by self interest
mills and factories took on new life labor was scarce and high it was a period of extravagance rather than pleasure people played that they might not think washington convinced that the nation would ultimately be involved
kept its secret well and continued to preach a neutrality it could not enforce war was to most of the nation a great dramatic spectacle presented to them at breakfast and in the afternoon editions
for the red cross and kindred activities but although the war was in the nations mind it was not yet in its soul life went on much as before an abiding faith in the allies was the foundation stone of its complacency
the great six months battle of the somme with its million casualties was resulting favorably on the east the russians had made some gains there were wagers that the germans would be done in the spring
but again washington knew that the british and french losses at the somme had been frightful that the amount of lost territory regained was negligible as against the territory still held that the food problem in the british islands was acute
that the submarine sinkings were colossal our peace was at a fearful cost and on the edge of this volcano america played when graham spencer left the mill that tuesday afternoon it was to visit marion hayden
he was rather bored now at the prospect he would have preferred going to the club to play billiards which was his custom of a late afternoon he drove rather more slowly than was his custom and so missed marions invitation to get there before the crowd
three cars before the house showed that she already had callers and indeed when the parlor maid opened the door a burst of laughter greeted him the hayden house was a general rendezvous there were usually by seven oclock whiskey and soda glasses
and tea cups on most of the furniture and half smoked cigarets on everything that would hold them including the piano marion herself met him in the hall and led him past the drawing room door
i kept the library as long as i could we can sit on the stairs if you like which they proceeded to do quite amiably from various open doors came subdued voices the air was pungent with tobacco smoke
permeated with a faint scent of late afternoon highballs tommy marion called when she had settled herself yes from a distance did you leave your cigaret on the piano
no toots dear but i can easily mother marion explained
well do you remember half the pretty things you told me last night not exactly but i meant them he looked up at her admiringly he was only a year from college and he had been rather arbitrarily limited to the debutantes
since the night before he had been rankling under a sense of youth was i pretty awful last night he asked you were very interesting and i imagine rather indiscreet
about the new war contracts oh business
and i like big figures poor people always do has it really gone through i mean those things do slip up sometimes dont they its gone through all right signed sealed and delivered
encouraged by her interest he elaborated on the new work he even developed an enthusiasm for it to his own surprise and the girl listened intently leaning forward so that her arm brushed his shoulder
her eyes slightly narrowed watched him closely she knew every move of the game she was determining to play marion hayden at twenty five knew already what her little world had not yet realized that such beauty as she had had
was the beauty of youth only and that that was going late hours golf perhaps a little more champagne than was necessary at dinners and the mornings found her almost plain and too
she had the far vision of the calculating mind she knew that if the country entered the war every eligible man she knew would immediately volunteer at twenty five she already noticed a change in the personnel of her followers
were now sending flowers to the debutantes and cutting in on the younger men at balls her house was still a rendezvous but it was for couples like the ones who had preempted the drawing room the library and the music room that afternoon
they met there smoked her cigarets made love in a corner occasionally became engaged but she was of the game no longer in it men still came to see her a growing percentage of them married
they brought or sent her tribute flowers candy and cigarets
but more and more her dinner invitations were from the older crowd like natalie spencers stupid party the night before so she watched graham and listened he was a nice boy and a handsome one
also he promised to be sole heir to a great business if the war only lasted long enough imagine your knowing all those things she said admiringly youre a partner arent you he flushed slightly
not yet but of course i shall be when you really get going i wonder if you will take me round and show me how shells are made im the most ignorant person you ever knew ill be awfully glad to
well go in and stir up some of the lovers she suggested and if tommy hale hasnt burned up the piano we can dance a bit you dance divinely you know it was after seven when he reached home he felt every inch a man
he held himself very straight as he entered the house and the boyish grin with which he customarily greeted the butler had given place to a dignified nod natalie was in her dressing room at his knock she told the maid to admit him
his new found maturity seemed to be slipping from him somehow here at home they always managed to make him feel like a small boy honestly mother id rather go to father and tell him about it
she ignored his protest as she always ignored protests against her own methods of handling matters im accustomed to it was her sole reply but her resigned voice brought her as it always had
the ready tribute of the boys sympathy sit down graham i want to talk to you he sat down still uneasily fingering the roll of bills
when at a sound in claytons room he stuck the money hastily into his pocket have you noticed a change in your father since he came back her tone was so ominous that he started hes not sick is he
she was holding out both hands to him piteously you wouldnt go would you i might have to go he evaded you wouldnt graham youre all i have all i have left to live for you wouldnt need to go its ridiculous youre needed here
your father needs you he needs me the hell of a lot the boy muttered but he went over and stooping down kissed her trembling face dont worry about me he said lightly i dont think weve got spine enough to get into the mix up anyhow
and if we have you wont go promise me you wont go when he hesitated she resorted to her old methods with both clayton and the boy she was doing all she could to make them happy she made no demands none
but when she asked for something that meant more than life to her it was refused of course she had gone through all sorts of humiliation to get him that money and this was the gratitude she received graham listened
she was a really pathetic figure crouched in her low chair and shaken with terror she must have rather a bad time there were so many things she dared not take to his father she brought them to him instead her small grievances
and she had helped him out of a hole just now all right i promise he said at last but youre worrying yourself for nothing mother she was quite content then cheered at once consulted the jewelled watch on her dressing table
the chief street of mowbray called castle street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighbourhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence
the dimensions of castle street were not unworthy of the metropolis it traversed a great portion of the town and was proportionately wide its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity
while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields
in the infancy of mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labours
would be the future eye sore of a flourishing posterity pursuing their course along castle street for about a quarter of a mile gerard and stephen turned down a street which intersected it
and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings
that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of mowbray crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but one of a very different description
to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with sybil this one was populous noisy and lighted it was saturday night the streets were thronged an infinite population kept swarming to and fro
by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps
the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest the bright and lively shops were crowded and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls
still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase and so it is widow said a little pale man wistfully come come its getting late and your wifes ill youre a good soul
or the mayor of mowbray at least wages said the man i wish you may get em those villains shuffle and screw have sarved me with another bate ticket and a pretty figure too
oh the carnal monsters exclaimed the widow if their day dont come the bloody minded knaves and for small cops too small cops be hanged am i the man to send up a bad bottomed cop widow carey
you sent up for snicks i have known you man and boy john hill these twenty summers and never heard a word against you till you got into shuffle and screws mill oh they are a bad yarn john
they do us all widow they pretends to give the same wages as the rest and works it out in fines you cant come and you cant go but theres a fine youre never paid wages but theres a bate ticket
ive heard they keep their whole establishment on factory fines soul alive but those shuffle and screw are rotten snickey bad yarns said mistress carey
weal indeed you look very like a soul as feeds on weal continued missus carey in an under tone as her declining customer moved away well it gets late said the widow
and if you like to take this scrag end home to your wife neighbour hill we can talk of the rest next saturday and whats your will sir said the widow with a stern expression to a youth who now stopped at her stall
he was about sixteen with a lithe figure and a handsome faded impudent face his long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waistcoat but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck
a high crowned dark brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye well you need not be so fierce mother carey said the youth with an affected air of deprecation
dont mother me said the jolly widow with a kindling eye go to your own mother who is dying in a back cellar without a winder while youve got lodgings in a two pair dying shes only drunk said the youth
what makes her drink but toil working from five oclock in the morning to seven oclock at night and for the like of such as you thats a good one said the youth i should like to know what my mother ever did for me but give me treacle and laudanum when i was a babby
to stop my tongue and fill my stomach by the token of which as my gal says she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all mowbray and here the youth drew himself up and thrust his hands in the side pockets of his pea jacket well
i never said missus carey no i never heard a thing like that what not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for veal cutlets mother hold your tongue mister imperence said the widow its very well known youre no christian and wholl believe what you say
its very well known that im a man what pays his way said the boy and dont keep a hucksters stall to sell carrion by star light but live in a two pair if you please and has a wife and family or as good
said a good humoured voice it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped they were gaily dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore coral neck laces and earrings of gold
she added in a lower tone well i have left mister traffords mill said the girl thats a bad job said missus carey for those traffords are kind to their people
so it is said the girl but then it was so dull i cant stand a country life missus carey i must have company well i do love a bit of gossip myself said missus carey with great frankness
and then im no scholar said the girl and never could take to learning and those traffords had so many schools learning is better than house and land said missus carey though im no scholar myself but then in my time things was different
but young persons yes said mick i dont think i could get through the day if it wurno for our institute and whats that asked missus carey with a sneer the shoddy court literary and scientific to be sure said mick
we have got fifty members and take in three london papers one northern star and two moral worlds and where are you now child continued the widow to the girl
if you will take a dish of tea with us to morrow we expect some friends i take it kindly said missus carey and so you keep house together all the children keep house in these days times is changed indeed
and we shall be happy to see you mick and julia if you are not engaged continued the girl and she looked at her friend a pretty demure girl who immediately said but in a somewhat faultering tone oh that we shall
well we had no thoughts but i said to harriet as it is a fine night let us walk about as long as we can and then to morrow we will lie in bed till afternoon
but at this season of the year i must have life the moment i came out i bathed in the river and then went home and dressed he added in a satisfied tone and now i am going to the temple ill tell you what julia has been pricked to day with a shuttle
ill stand treat and take you and your friend to the temple well thats delight said caroline theres no one does the handsome thing like you dandy mick and i always say so oh i love the temple tis so genteel
i was speaking of it to harriet last night
i proposed to go with her but two girls alone you understand me one does not like to be seen in these places as if one kept no company very true said mick and now well be off good night widow
morley paused as he recognised egremont then advancing to gerard followed by his companion he said this is mister hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
perhaps i should rather say of your poor dear father said hatton scanning gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added he was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things
and i venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted
and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to sybil she beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears
and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies
that appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin
detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced
is the privilege of the people of whom i am one said hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate but is your labour their labour said sybil
is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew i was with him more than an hour continued morley at first he recollected nothing
he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on i was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children
this led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest at first he talked of writing to see your father and i offered that gerard should call upon him
he took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the house of lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me
he would propose that i should at once accompany him i thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here
you did well good stephen as you always do said sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you he threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it their eyes had met
hers were kind and calm and this egremont said morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here when we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the
the mystification of which we had been dupes and you did wrong said sybil there is no wisdom like frankness had you told me he would not have been here today he met and addressed me and i only recognised an acquaintance
had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others i might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience
you are right said morley looking at her rather keenly we have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat i should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said sybil
he chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family and for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them
and yet if anything were to happen to morrow said morley rest assured this man has his eye on us he can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move
the factions become united sybil turned and looked at him and then said and what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us do not they know everything do not you meet in their very sight
you pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not what then is there to fear and why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive all is very well at this moment said morley and all may continue well
but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits sybil your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life it does not much suit me i am a man of the closet
morley shrugged his shoulders and then said an easy question questions are always easy the fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine i could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape
lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them
there can be other than one and the same object a thousand said morley we have already as many parties as in saint stephens itself you terrify me said sybil i knew we had fearful odds to combat against
my visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies but i believed that we had on our side god and truth they know neither of them in the national convention said morley
the factions and the failures of our oppressors at this moment gerard and hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of sybil and morley
saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed you understand i have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right i believe on every principle of justice that mowbray castle is as much yours
as the house that is built by the tenant on the lords land but can we prove it we never had the legal evidence you are in error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda
very useful no doubt i hope i shall find them but of no validity if money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting i owe much to the memory of your father my good gerard i would fain serve you and your daughter
ill not tell you what i would do for you my good gerard you would think me foolish but i am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times i really am scarcely fit for business
the seventh chapter
the bridge of apes queen ermintrude had never in her life seen her husband so terrible as he got that night he gnashed his teeth with rage
he called everybody a fool he threw his tooth brush at the palace cat he rushed round in his night shirt and woke up all his army and sent them into the jungle to catch the doctor
then he made all his servants go too his cooks and his gardeners and his barber and prince bumpos tutor even the queen who was tired from dancing in a pair of tight shoes
was packed off to help the soldiers in their search all this time the doctor and his animals were running through the forest towards the land of the monkeys as fast as they could go gub gub
with his short legs soon got tired and the doctor had to carry him which made it pretty hard when they had the trunk and the hand bag with them as well the king of the jolliginki
thought it would be easy for his army to find them because the doctor was in a strange land and would not know his way but he was wrong because the monkey chee chee knew all the paths through the jungle better even than the kings men did
and he led the doctor and his pets to the very thickest part of the forest a place where no man had ever been before and hid them all in a big hollow tree between high rocks
so there they stayed the whole night through they often heard the kings men searching and talking in the jungle round about but they were quite safe for no one knew of that hiding place but chee chee not even the other monkeys
at last when daylight began to come through the thick leaves overhead they heard queen ermintrude saying in a very tired voice that it was no use looking any more that they might as well go back and get some sleep
and they set off for the land of the monkeys it was a long long way and they often got very tired especially gub gub but when he cried they gave him milk out of the cocoanuts
chee chee and polynesia always seemed to be able to get it for them or something like it they even got the doctor some tobacco one day when he had finished what he had brought with him and wanted to smoke
and enjoyed the life of travel very much but they were always glad when the night came and they stopped for their resting time then the doctor used to make a little fire of sticks
they would sit round it in a ring listening to polynesia singing songs about the sea or to chee chee telling stories of the jungle and many of the tales that chee chee told were very interesting
because although the monkeys had no history books of their own before doctor dolittle came to write them for them they remember everything that happens by telling stories to their children
of the days when men dressed in bear skins and lived in holes in the rock and ate their mutton raw because they did not know what cooking was having never seen a fire
and he told them of the great mammoths and lizards as long as a train that wandered over the mountains in those times nibbling from the tree tops and often they got so interested listening
they were still being followed by the kings men if chee chee had known this he would most likely have hidden them again but he didnt know it one day chee chee climbed up a high rock and looked out over the tree tops
these monkeys made a tremendous noise cheering and waving leaves and swinging out of the branches to greet him they wanted to carry his bag and his trunk and everything he had and one of the bigger ones even carried gub gub
had heard the noise of the monkeys cheering and they at last knew where the doctor was and hastened on to catch him the big monkey carrying gub gub was coming along behind slowly
and he saw the captain of the army sneaking through the trees so he hurried after the doctor and told him to run then they all ran harder than they had ever run in their lives and the kings men
coming after them began to run too and the captain ran hardest of all then the doctor tripped over his medicine bag and fell down in the mud and the captain thought he would surely catch him this time
but the captain had very long ears though his hair was very short and as he sprang forward to take hold of the doctor one of his ears caught fast in a tree
by this time the doctor had picked himself up and on they went again running and running and chee chee shouted its all right we havent far to go now
but before they could get into the land of the monkeys they came to a steep cliff with a river flowing below this was the end of the kingdom of jolliginki
and the land of the monkeys was on the other side across the river and jip the dog looked down over the edge of the steep steep cliff and said golly how are we ever going to get across
oh dear said gub gub the kings men are quite close now look at them i am afraid we are going to be taken back to prison again and he began to weep
theyve got the captain loose and hes coming on like a deer get lively
was a bridge all ready for him made of living monkeys for while his back was turned the monkeys quick as a flash had made themselves into a bridge
and the big one shouted to the doctor walk over walk over all of you hurry gub gub was a bit scared walking on such a narrow bridge at that dizzy height
and so did all of them john dolittle was the last to cross and just as he was getting to the other side the kings men came rushing up to the edge of the cliff then they shook their fists and yelled with rage
many great explorers and gray bearded naturalists have lain long weeks hidden in the jungle waiting to see the monkeys do that trick but we never let a white man get a glimpse of it before you are the first to see the famous bridge of apes
public prosecutor and determined jury sat every day their lists went forth every evening
come out and listen to the evening paper you inside there charles evremonde called darnay so at last began the evening paper at la force
charles evremonde called darnay had reason to know the usage he had seen hundreds pass away so
and two had already been guillotined and forgotten the list was read in the vaulted chamber where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival every one of those had perished in the massacre
every human creature he had since cared for and parted with had died on the scaffold there were hurried words of farewell and kindness but the parting was soon over it was the incident of every day
and a little concert for that evening they crowded to the grates and shed tears there but twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled and the time was at best short to the lock up hour
when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night the prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling their ways arose out of the condition of the time similarly
but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind in seasons of pestilence some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease a terrible passing inclination to die of it
and all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts only needing circumstances to evoke them the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark
the night in its vermin haunted cells was long and cold next day fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before charles darnays name was called all the fifteen were condemned
some daggers some ate and drank as they looked on many knitted among these last was one with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked she was in a front row by the side of a man
but what he most noticed in the two figures was that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be they never looked towards him they seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination
and they looked at the jury but at nothing else under the president sat doctor manette in his usual quiet dress as well as the prisoner could see he and mister lorry were the only men there unconnected with the tribunal
who wore their usual clothes and had not assumed the coarse garb
whose life was forfeit to the republic under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of death it was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to france there he was and there was the decree
he had been taken in france and his head was demanded take off his head cried the audience an enemy to the republic the president rang his bell to silence those cries
undoubtedly it was was he not an emigrant then what did he call himself not an emigrant he hoped within the sense and spirit of the law why not the president desired to know
because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him and a station that was distasteful to him and had left his country he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the tribunal was in use
to live by his own industry in england rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france what proof had he of this he handed in the names of two witnesses theophile gabelle and alexandre manette
the president reminded him true but not an english woman a citizeness of france yes by birth her name and family
lucie manette only daughter of doctor manette the good physician who sits there this answer had a happy effect upon the audience cries in exaltation of the well known good physician rent the hall
on these few steps of his dangerous way charles darnay had set his foot according to doctor manettes reiterated instructions the same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him
and had prepared every inch of his road the president asked why had he returned to france when he did and not sooner he had not returned sooner he replied simply because he had no means of living in france save those he had resigned
whereas in england he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature he had returned when he did on the pressing and written entreaty of a french citizen who represented that his life was endangered by his absence
he had come back to save a citizens life and to bear his testimony at whatever personal hazard to the truth was that criminal in the eyes of the republic the populace cried enthusiastically
no and the president rang his bell to quiet them which it did not for they continued to cry no
the president required the name of that citizen the accused explained that the citizen was his first witness he also referred with confidence to the citizens letter which had been taken from him at the barrier
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the president the doctor had taken care that it should be there had assured him that it would be there
that in the pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the republic with which it had to deal he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the abbaye in fact
by the surrender of the citizen evremonde called darnay doctor manette was next questioned his high personal popularity and the clearness of his answers made a great impression
but as he proceeded as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment that the accused had remained in england always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile that
so far from being in favour with the aristocrat government there he had actually been tried for his life by it as the foe of england and friend of the united states as he brought these circumstances into view with the greatest discretion
and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness the jury and the populace became one at last when he appealed by name to monsieur lorry an english gentleman then and there present who like himself
had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his account of it the jury declared that they had heard enough and that they were ready with their votes if the president were content to receive them at every vote
the jurymen voted aloud and individually the populace set up a shout of applause all the voices were in the prisoners favour and the president declared him free
then began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy
or which they regarded as some set off against their swollen account of cruel rage no man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable it is probable to a blending of all the three
with the second predominating no sooner was the acquittal pronounced than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him
that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion none the less because he knew very well that the very same people carried by another current would have rushed at him with the very same intensity
to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets his removal to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried rescued him from these caresses for the moment
five were to be tried together next as enemies of the republic forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed so quick was the tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost
that these five came down to him before he left the place condemned to die within twenty four hours the first of them told him so with the customary prison sign of death a raised finger and they all added in words
long live the republic the five had had it is true no audience to lengthen their proceedings for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate there was a great crowd about it
in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in court except two for which he looked in vain on his coming out the concourse made at him anew weeping embracing and shouting all by turns and all together
until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted seemed to run mad like the people on the shore they put him into a great chair they had among them
in winding and tramping through them as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived her father had gone on before to prepare her
and when her husband stood upon his feet she dropped insensible in his arms as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd
so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen a few of the people fell to dancing
after grasping the doctors hand as he stood victorious and proud before him after grasping the hand of mister lorry
and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who lifted her he took his wife in his arms and carried her up to their rooms lucie my own i am safe o dearest charles
let me thank god for this on my knees as i have prayed to him they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts when she was again in his arms he said to her
no other man in all this france could have done what he has done for me she laid her head upon her fathers breast as she had laid his poor head on her own breast long long ago he was happy in the return he had made her
he was proud of his strength
a few days passed away and catherine though not allowing herself to suspect her friend could not help watching her closely the result of her observations was not agreeable
it might have passed unnoticed a something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her but had nothing worse appeared
that might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest but when catherine saw her in public admitting captain tilneys attentions as readily as they were offered
but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which catherine could not but resent james was the sufferer she saw him grave and uneasy and however careless of his present comfort
and she thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment for in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump room his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of isabellas engagement
she wished by a gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of her situation and make her aware of this double unkindness but for remonstrance either opportunity or comprehension was always against her
if able to suggest a hint isabella could never understand it in this distress the intended departure of the tilney family became her chief consolation their journey into gloucestershire was to take place within a few days
and captain tilneys removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own but captain tilney had at present no intention of removing he was not to be of the party to northanger he was to continue at bath
when catherine knew this her resolution was directly made she spoke to henry tilney on the subject regretting his brothers evident partiality for miss thorpe and entreating him to make known her prior engagement
my brother does know it was henrys answer does he then why does he stay here he made no reply and was beginning to talk of something else but she eagerly continued
the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybodys sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here
henry smiled and said i am sure my brother would not wish to do that then you will persuade him to go away persuasion is not at command but pardon me
i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master no he does not know what he is about cried catherine he does not know the pain he is giving my brother
not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable and are you sure it is my brothers doing yes very sure is it my brothers attentions to miss thorpe
or miss thorpes admission of them that gives the pain
i think mister morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another mans admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment catherine blushed for her friend and said
isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my fathers consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever
you know she must be attached to him i understand
after a short pause catherine resumed with then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother i can have no opinion on that subject but what can your brother mean
if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour you are a very close questioner am i i only ask what i want to be told
yes i think so for you must know your brothers heart my brothers heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at well
well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you
after some moments consideration you may be able to guess at your brothers intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about
sure if your father were to speak to him he would go my dear miss morland said henry in this amiable solicitude for your brothers comfort may you not be a little mistaken
are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpes for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney
is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure
perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave he added though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us
his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance
the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilneys passion for a month catherine would contend no longer against comfort
chapter sixteen shortage of air consequently above below and around the nautilus there were impenetrable frozen walls we were the ice banks prisoners the canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist
conseil kept still i stared at the captain his face had resumed its usual emotionlessness he crossed his arms he pondered the nautilus did not stir the captain then broke into speech gentlemen
he said in a calm voice there are two ways of dying under the conditions in which were placed this inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor working out a problem for his pupils the first way he went on
is death by crushing the second is death by asphyxiation i dont mention the possibility of death by starvation because the nautiluss provisions will certainly last longer than we will
therefore lets concentrate on our chances of being crushed or asphyxiated as for asphyxiation captain i replied that isnt a cause for alarm because the air tanks are full true
but theyll supply air for only two days now then weve been buried beneath the waters for thirty six hours and the nautiluss heavy atmosphere already needs renewing in another forty eight hours our reserve air will be used up
well then captain lets free ourselves within forty eight hours well try to at least by cutting through one of these walls surrounding us which one i asked borings will tell us that
im going to ground the nautilus on the lower shelf then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the thinnest of these ice walls can the panels in the lounge be left open without ill effect were no longer in motion
hissing sounds soon told me that water was being admitted into the ballast tanks the nautilus slowly settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of three hundred fifty meters the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged
my friends i said were in a serious predicament but im counting on your courage and energy sir the canadian replied this is no time to bore you with my complaints
he can use me any way he wants he wont turn down your assistance come along ned i led the canadian to the room where the nautiluss men were putting on their diving suits i informed the captain of neds proposition
which was promptly accepted the canadian got into his underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers
after ned was dressed i reentered the lounge whose windows had been uncovered stationed next to conseil i examined the strata surrounding and supporting the nautilus some moments later we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of ice
before digging into the ice the captain had to obtain borings to insure working in the best direction long bores were driven into the side walls but after fifteen meters the instruments were still impeded by the thickness of those walls
more than four hundred meters high
there we were separated from the sea by a ten meter barrier thats how thick the iceberg was from this point on it was an issue of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the nautiluss waterline this meant detaching about
six thousand five hundred cubic meters to dig a hole through which the ship could descend below this tract of ice work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity instead of digging all around the nautilus which would have entailed even greater difficulties
then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around its circumference soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact matter and huge chunks were loosened from its mass
these chunks weighed less than the water and by an unusual effect of specific gravity each chunk took wing as it were to the roof of the tunnel
but this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner after two hours of energetic work ned land reentered exhausted he and his companions were replaced by new workmen including conseil and me
the nautiluss chief officer supervised us the water struck me as unusually cold but i warmed up promptly while wielding my pick my movements were quite free although they were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres
and the nautiluss atmosphere which was already charged with carbon dioxide the air hadnt been renewed in forty eight hours and its life giving qualities were considerably weakened meanwhile
after twelve hours had gone by we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick hence about six hundred cubic meters assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours
before the nautilus could return to the surface of the waves couldnt we all die of asphyxiation were this ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice it was a dreadful state of affairs but we faced it head on
each one of us determined to do his duty to the end during the night in line with my forecasts a new one meter slice was removed from this immense socket but in the morning wearing my diving suit
when i noted that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other the liquid strata farthest from the trench not warmed by the movements of workmen and tools were showing a tendency to solidify in the face of this imminent new danger
there was no point in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous rescue work but when i returned on board
i know he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook couldnt change its one more danger but i dont know any way of warding it off our sole chance for salvation
is to work faster than the water solidifies weve got to get there first thats all get there first by then i should have been used to this type of talk for several hours that day i wielded my pick doggedly
the work kept me going besides working meant leaving the nautilus which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by our equipment which meant leaving the thin foul air behind
near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench when i returned on board i was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide saturating the air oh if only we had the chemical methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas
there was no lack of oxygen all this water contained a considerable amount
this life giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us i had thought it all out but to no avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship to absorb it we would need to fill containers with potassium hydroxide
and shake them continually but this substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it
without this precaution we wouldnt have awakened the following morning the next day march twenty sixth i returned to my miners trade working to remove the fifth meter the ice banks side walls and underbelly had visibly thickened
obviously they would come together before the nautilus could break free for an instant i was gripped by despair my pick nearly slipped from my hands what was the point of this digging if i was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone
a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages i felt like i was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster jaws irresistibly closing supervising our work
working himself captain nemo passed near me just then i touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our prison the starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four meters from the nautiluss hull
the captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him we returned on board my diving suit removed i went with him to the lounge professor aronnax he told me this calls for heroic measures
or well be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement yes i said but what can we do oh he exclaimed
if only my nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed well i asked not catching the captains meaning dont you understand he went on that the congealing of this water
could come to our rescue dont you see that by solidifying it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us just as its freezing can burst the hardest stones arent you aware that this force could be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction
i know it sir so we cant rely on nature to rescue us only our own efforts we must counteract this solidification we must hold it in check not only are the side walls closing in
but there arent ten feet of water ahead or astern of the nautilus all around us this freeze is gaining fast how long i asked will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to breathe on board the captain looked me straight in the eye
it was now the twenty sixth we had lived off the ships stores for five days and all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen even today as i write these lines my sensations are so intense
that an involuntary terror sweeps over me and my lungs still seem short of air meanwhile
boiling water i exclaimed yes sir were shut up in a relatively confined area if the nautiluss pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into this space wouldnt that raise its temperature and delay its freezing
its worth trying i said resolutely so lets try it professor
captain nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at work supplying drinking water via evaporation the mechanism was loaded with water and the full electric heat of our batteries was thrown into coils awash in liquid
in a few minutes the water reached one hundred degrees centigrade it was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process the heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply going through the mechanism water drawn cold from the sea arrived
boiling hot at the body of the pump the steaming water was injected into the icy water outside and after three hours had passed
that was one degree gained
after i monitored the operations progress double checking it with many inspections i told the captain its working i think so he answered me weve escaped being crushed now we have only asphyxiation to fear
the injections couldnt get it to go a single degree higher
i was finally assured that there was no danger of it solidifying by the next day march twenty seventh six meters of ice had been torn from the socket only four meters were left to be removed that still meant forty eight hours of work
the air couldnt be renewed in the nautiluss interior accordingly that day it kept getting worse an unbearable heaviness weighed me down near three oclock in the afternoon this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree
yawns dislocated my jaws my lungs were gasping in their quest for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing now growing scarcer and scarcer my mind was in a daze i lay outstretched strength gone
nearly unconscious my gallant conseil felt the same symptoms suffered the same sufferings yet never left my side he held my hand he kept encouraging me and i even heard him mutter
to leave more air for master it brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words since conditions inside were universally unbearable
picks rang out on that bed of ice arms grew weary hands were rubbed raw but who cared about exhaustion what difference were wounds life sustaining air reached our lungs we could breathe we could breathe
and yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted him his shift over each man surrendered to a gasping companion the air tank that would revive him
when his time was up he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on board always calm unflinching and uncomplaining that day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy
over the whole surface area only two meters were left to be removed only two meters separated us from the open sea but the ships air tanks were nearly empty the little air that remained had to be saved for the workmen not an
atom for the nautilus when i returned on board i felt half suffocated what a night im unable to depict it such sufferings are indescribable the next day i was short winded
headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me reel like a drunk my companions were experiencing the same symptoms some crewmen were at their last gasp
and he decided to crush this layer the man had kept his energy and composure he had subdued physical pain with moral strength he could still think plan and act at his orders the craft was eased off
in other words it was raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity when it was afloat the crew towed it leading it right above the immense trench outlined to match the ships waterline next the ballast tanks filled with water
the boat sank and was fitted into its socket just then the whole crew returned on board and the double outside door was closed by this point the nautilus was resting on a bed of ice only one meter thick
we listened we forgot our sufferings we hoped once more we had staked our salvation on this one last gamble despite the buzzing in my head i soon could hear vibrations under the nautiluss hull we tilted
the ice cracked with an odd ripping sound like paper tearing and the nautilus began settling downward were going through conseil muttered in my ear i couldnt answer him i clutched his hand
i squeezed it in an involuntary convulsion all at once carried away by its frightful excess load the nautilus sank into the waters like a cannonball in other words dropping as if in a vacuum
our full electric power was then put on the pumps which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks after a few minutes we had checked our fall the pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending movement
brought to full speed the propeller made the sheet iron hull tremble down to its rivets and we sped northward but how long would it take to navigate under the ice bank to the open sea another day i would be dead first
my muscles had no power to contract im unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way but i was aware that my death throes had begun i realized that i was about to die suddenly i regained consciousness
a few whiffs of air had entered my lungs had we risen to the surface of the waves had we cleared the ice bank no ned and conseil my two gallant friends were sacrificing themselves to save me
instead of breathing it themselves they had saved it for me and while they were suffocating they poured life into me drop by drop i tried to push the device away they held my hands and for a few moments i could breathe luxuriously
my eyes flew toward the clock it was eleven in the morning it had to be march twenty eighth the nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of forty miles per hour it was writhing in the waters
had he perished had his companions died with him
separating us from the open air was a mere tract of ice could we break through it
from cape horn to the amazon how i got onto the platform im unable to say perhaps the canadian transferred me there but i could breathe i could inhale the life giving sea air
next to me my two companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles poor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustnt pounce heedlessly on the first food given them we on the other hand didnt have to practice such moderation
we could suck the atoms from the air by the lungful and it was the breeze the breeze itself that poured into us this luxurious intoxication ahhh conseil was putting in
what fine oxygen let master have no fears about breathing theres enough for everyone as for ned land he didnt say a word but his wide open jaws would have scared off a shark
and what powerful inhalations the canadian drew like a furnace going full blast our strength returned promptly and when i looked around i saw that we were alone on the platform no crewmen
those strange seamen on the nautilus were content with the oxygen circulating inside not one of them had come up to enjoy the open air the first words i pronounced were words of appreciation
and gratitude to my two companions ned and conseil had kept me alive during the final hours of our long death throes but no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion
good lord professor ned land answered me dont mention it what did we do thats so praiseworthy not a thing it was a question of simple arithmetic your life is worth more than ours so we had to save it
and you my gallant conseil you suffered a great deal not too much to be candid with master i was lacking a few throatfuls of air but i would have gotten by
it took my breath away in a manner of confounded by this lapse into banality conseil left his sentence hanging my friends i replied very moved
were bound to each other forever and im deeply indebted to you which ill take advantage of the canadian shot back
conseil put in yes ned land went on you can repay your debt by coming with me when i leave this infernal nautilus by the way conseil said are we going in a favorable direction
yes i replied because were going in the direction of the sun and here the sun is due north sure ned land went on but it remains to be seen whether well make for the atlantic or the pacific
but if we returned to the pacific far from every populated shore what would happen to ned lands plans we would soon settle this important point the nautilus traveled swiftly
soon we had cleared the antarctic circle plus the promontory of cape horn
by then all our past sufferings were forgotten the memory of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds we had thoughts only of the future
now then that evening it became obvious much to my satisfaction that we were returning north by the atlantic route i shared the results of my observations with the canadian and conseil
thats good news the canadian replied but wheres the nautilus going im unable to say ned after the south pole
well never regret having known him especially once weve left him ned land shot back the next day
when the nautilus rose to the surface of the waves a few minutes before noon we raised land to the west
the land of fire a name given it by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the natives huts this land of fire forms a huge cluster of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide
its coastline looked flat but high mountains rose in the distance i even thought i glimpsed mt sarmiento
a pyramid shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit which depending on whether its clear or veiled in vapor predicts fair weather or foul as ned land told me a first class barometer my friend
yes sir a natural barometer that didnt let me down when i navigated the narrows of the strait of magellan just then its peak appeared before us standing out distinctly against the background of the skies this forecast fair weather
bulb bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few specimens with their smooth viscous filaments they measured as much as three hundred meters long genuine cables more than an inch thick and very tough
it served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks for crabs and cuttlefish here seals and otters could indulge in a sumptuous meal mixing meat from fish
with vegetables from the sea like the english with their irish stews the nautilus passed over these lush luxuriant depths with tremendous speed
in these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the worlds best mussels
as for fish i specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus especially some gudgeon two decimeters long sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots
i likewise marveled at the numerous medusas including the most beautiful of their breed the compass jellyfish unique to the falkland seas
some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat festoons others looked like
upside down baskets from which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing they swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift
shadows illusions melting and evaporating outside their native element when the last tips of the falkland islands had disappeared below the horizon
between twenty and twenty five meters and went along the south american coast
didnt put in an appearance
keeping to its northerly heading it followed the long windings of south america by then we had fared sixteen thousand leagues since coming on board in the seas of japan
near eleven oclock in the morning we cut the tropic of capricorn on the thirty seventh meridian passing well out from cape frio much to ned lands displeasure
captain nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of brazils populous shores because he shot by with dizzying speed
its late alexey alexandrovitch she said when she had gone through the doorway anna its necessary for me to have a talk with you with me she said wonderingly she came out from behind the door of the dressing room and looked at him
why what is it what about she asked sitting down well lets talk if its so necessary but it would be better to get to sleep anna said what came to her lips and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying
how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy
that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual
she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind
that she did not care to say a word about herself meant a great deal he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were closed against him more than that he saw from her tone
that she was not even perturbed at that but as it were said straight out to him yes its shut up and so it must be and will be in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have returning home and finding his own house locked up
but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexey alexandrovitch i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution
your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis attracted attention he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look
i wasnt dull does that offend you alexey alexandrovitch shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack
anna is this you said alexey alexandrovitch quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his fingers
what do you want of me alexey alexandrovitch paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world
he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them
and i beg you to listen to it i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be influenced by it but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i observed it
but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired i positively dont understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he doesnt care she thought
but other people noticed it and thats what upsets him youre not well alexey alexandrovitch she added and she got up and would have gone towards the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her his face was ugly and forbidding
as anna had never seen him she stopped and bending her head back and on one side began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins well im listening to whats to come she said calmly and ironically and indeed i listen with interest
began alexey alexandrovitch ferreting in ones soul one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience
to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement
i dont understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins anna for gods sake dont speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken
but believe me what i say i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the word love threw her into revolt again she thought
love can he love if he hadnt heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he doesnt even know what love is alexey alexandrovitch really i dont understand she said define what it is you find
that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place
in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them
when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it
but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and had forgotten about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly
she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexey alexandrovitch seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again
with a new tranquil rhythm its late its late she whispered with a smile
why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phrixus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the golden fleeced ram since that time phrixus had married the kings daughter
and had spent their play days in the outskirts of the grove in the center of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father
when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis
every person who might venture within his reach there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princes
i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster
at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece we will none of us turn back cried his nine and forty brave comrades
much good may it do him and orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously
and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way
heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to court
who dethroned his father you are welcome brave jason
pray are you on a pleasure voyage
or what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court great sir replied jason
for chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggars
provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away in spite of himself the kings face twisted itself into an angry frown
for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession
had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure
what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting possession of the golden fleece i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful
true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly good natured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example
which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder
i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose
from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men they are an unruly set of reprobates those sons of the dragons teeth and unless you treat them suitably they will fall upon you sword in hand
and the four footed pedant his schoolmaster into the bargain why what a foolhardy self conceited coxcomb he is well see what my fire breathing bulls will do for him well prince jason he continued aloud and as complaisantly as he could
make yourself comfortable for to day and to morrow morning since you insist upon it you shall try your skill at the plow while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger
this young woman followed him out of the room i am the kings daughter she said to him and my name is medea i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of if you will trust to me
i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sow the dragons teeth and get the golden fleece indeed beautiful princess answered jason if you will do me this service i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long gazing at medea
he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them
yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom if jason had been capable of fearing anything
for beautiful as she now looked
princess he exclaimed you seem indeed very wise and very powerful but how can you help me to do the things of which you speak are you an enchantress yes prince jason answered medea with a smile
it is well for you that i am favorably inclined for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason if i only knew how to manage the brazen footed and fiery lunged bulls
which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched
which it contained and where to meet her at midnight only be brave added she and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself
and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the kings palace
just as they had been pulled out of the monsters jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pasture ground where the two brazen footed bulls were kept it was a starry night
with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky
in that farthest corner of the field it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden fleece
it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder are you sure beautiful medea asked jason
the instant he made a step farther
these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds at the first two or three steps which jason made
the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air he went a little farther
one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals
as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intensely hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself
greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder
just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwed up tail and held them in a gripe like that of an iron vice one with his right hand the other with his left
to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time
when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to gripe him by the tail is pretty much the same thing that is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it
it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow
who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plow at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the greensward and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before him
a large tract of black earth ready to be sown with the dragons teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil with a brush harrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next
must we wait long for harvest time he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragons teeth have been sown
and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field
like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil
tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragons tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clangor with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely
full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense of the boon of their own existence
and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did
clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the red hot thirst for battle then they began to shout show us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die
and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battle field and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight
had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragons teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears
the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft
and instead of running any farther towards jason they began to fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host
hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other
for an offense which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragons teeth were stretched lifeless on the field
the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give a shout of exultation crying victory victory immortal fame
when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren and there was the end of the army that had sprouted from the dragons teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth
let them sleep in the bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity
will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the self conceit of that last fellow
you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your nights work has been well performed
that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled
entering the presence chamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obeisance your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night
and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazen lunged bulls
the field has been plowed the dragons teeth have been sown broadcast and harrowed into the soil
and depart with my nine and forty comrades
and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls
and the dragons teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate
not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instant
to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks jason left the kings presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better
march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for iolchos the success of this scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point
at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps
and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended upon
will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragons teeth
and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis
stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove
lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do
their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished
than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they could manage to crop it
how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath after kindly patting the bulls
jason followed medeas guidance into the grove of mars where the great oak trees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it
medea squeezed jasons hand look yonder she whispered do you see it gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun
what is it asked jason have you come so far to seek it
when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze o how beautiful it looked shining with a marvelous light of its own that
prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazen lunged bulls how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture it
the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jasons memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came
for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach
on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here
upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within arms length of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight
the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the kings palace well jason whispered medea for she was ill natured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble
what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm
far more effectually than your sword the dragon had probably heard the voices for swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached
medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monsters wide open throat immediately with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggle flinging his tail up to the tip top of the tallest tree
and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down again the dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason
so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us begone you have won the golden fleece jason caught the fleece from the tree
with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees
who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynceus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece
although several stone walls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley
held perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice make haste prince jason for your life make haste
the war message concluded with still another defense of the fight for political liberty to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have with the pride of those who know
we were face to face with the question which we had considered at the convention the previous month when war was rumored as to what position we as an organization should take in this situation the atmosphere of that convention had been dramatic in the extreme
most of the delegates assembled had been approached either before going to washington or upon arriving and urged to use their influence to persuade the organization to abandon its work for the freedom of women and turn its activities into war channels
although war was then only rumored the hysterical attitude was already prevalent women were asked to furl their banners and give up their half century struggle for democracy to forget the liberty that was most precious to their hearts
the president will turn this imperialistic war into a crusade for democracy lay aside your own fight and help us crush germany and you will find yourselves rewarded with a vote out of the nations gratitude were some of the appeals made to our women by government officials high and low
and by the rank and file of men and women never in history did a band of women stand together with more sanity and greater solidarity than did these one thousand delegates representing thousands more throughout the states as our official organ the suffragist
pointed out editorially in its issue of april twenty first nineteen seventeen
we were united on no other subject some would offer passive resistance to the war others would become devoted followers of a vigorous military policy between these every shade of opinion was represented each was loyal to the ideas which she held for her country
had nothing to do it was concerned only with the effort to obtain for women the opportunity to give effective expression through political power to their ideals whatever they might be
the thousand delegates present at the convention though differing widely on the duty of the individual in war were unanimous in voting that in the event of war the national womans party as an organization should continue to work for political liberty for women and for that alone
believing as the convention stated in its resolutions that in so doing the organization serves the highest interest of the country
they were also unanimous in the opinion that all service which individuals wished to give to war or peace should be given through groups organized for such purposes
for one purpose only to secure an amendment to the united states constitution enfranchising women we declared officially through our organ that this held as the policy of the womans party whatever turn public events may take
and announced that no subjects would be considered by them unless the president urged them as war measures our task was from that time on to make national suffrage a war measure we at once urged upon the administration the wisdom of accepting this proposed reform as a war measure
and pointed out the difficulty of waging a war for democracy abroad while democracy was denied at home but the government was not willing to profit by the experience of its allies in extending suffrage to women without first offering a terrible and brutal resistance
was most perplexing here were we citizens without power and recognition with the only weapons to which a powerless class which does not take up arms can resort we could not and would not fight with mens weapons
compare the methods women adopted to those men use in the pursuit of democracy
bayonets machine guns poison gas deadly grenades liquid fire bombs armored tanks pistols barbed wire entanglements submarines mines every known scientific device with which to annihilate the enemy
what did we do we continued to fight with our simple peaceful almost quaint device a banner a little more fiery perhaps pertinent to the latest political controversy but still only a banner inscribed with militant truth
just as our political strategy had been to oppose at elections the party in power which had failed to use its power to free women so now our military strategy was based on the military doctrine of concentrating all ones forces on the enemys weakest point
and the denial of democracy at home this was the untenable position of president wilson and the democratic administration from which we must force them to retreat we could force such a retreat when we had exposed to the world this weakest point
just as the bluff of a democratic crusade must be called so must the knight leader of the crusade be exposed to the critical eyes of the world
here was the champion of their democratic aspirations here was a kind of universal moses expected to lead all peoples out of bondage no matter what the bondage no matter of how long standing
it was an advantage to us in that it made our attack more dramatic one supposed to be impeccable was more vulnerable it was a disadvantage to have to overcome this universal trust and world wide popularity
but this conflict of wits and brains against power only enhanced our ingenuity on the day the english mission headed by mister balfour and the french mission headed by m viviani visited the white house we took these inscriptions to the picket line
in our capacity to embarrass mister wilson in his administration lay our only hope of success
we intended to know why if democracy were so precious as to demand the nations blood and treasure for its achievement abroad its execution at home was so undesirable meanwhile
i tell you solemnly ladies and gentlemen we cannot any longer postpone justice in these united states
and if he doesnt listen to my advice i am going to make it as unpleasant as i can president wilson
some rumblings of political action began to be heard the democratic majority had appointed a senate committee on woman suffrage whose members were overwhelmingly for federal action the chairman senator andreas jones of new mexico
promised an early report to the senate there were scores of gains in congress representatives and senators were tumbling over each other to introduce similar suffrage resolutions we actually had difficulty in choosing the man whose name should stamp our measure
in addition to this plank they adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of democracy at home
and instructing the chairman of the convention to request a committee consisting of representatives of all liberal groups
they appointed a committee from the convention to carry these resolutions to the president the committee included mister j a h hopkins of the progressive party as chairman
mister john spargo of the socialist party mister virgil hinshaw chairman of the executive committee of the prohibition party and miss mabel vernon secretary of the national womans party
the president was deeply moved indeed almost to the point of tears when miss mabel vernon said mister president the feelings of many women in this country are best expressed by your own words in your war message to congress
we were not primarily interested in the amplification of congressional machinery unless this amplification was to be followed by the passage of the amendment the president could as easily have written the senate committee on suffrage or the judiciary committee of the house
advising an immediate report on the suffrage resolution as have asked for the creation of another committee to report on the subject he made no mention of his state by state conviction however as he had in previous interviews
and the committee of progressives understood him to have at least tacitly accepted federal action the house judiciary committee continued to refuse to act and the house rules committee steadily refused to create a suffrage committee
hoping to win back to the fold the wandering progressives who had thus demonstrated their allegiance to suffrage and seeing an opportunity to embarrass the administration the republicans began to interest themselves in action on the amendment
the authorization of an expenditure of ten thousand dollars for the erection of a monument to a dead president as a legitimate war measure it was clear from the partisan attitude of those who took part in the debate
that we were advancing to that position where we were as good political material to be contested over by opposing political groups as was a monument to a dead president and if the democrats could defend such an issue as a war measure
the administration was aroused it did not know how far the republicans were prepared to go in their drive for action so on the day of this flurry in the house the snail like rules committee
and by a vote of six to five decided to report favorably on the resolution providing for a woman suffrage committee in the house after all pending war measures have been disposed of before the meeting
the pickets continued their vigil and the motion carried still uncertain as to the purposes of the republicans the democrats were moved to further action
meeting in washington a few days later voted four to nine to officially urge upon the president that he call the two houses of congress together and recommend the immediate submission of the susan b anthony amendment this action which in effect reversed the plank in the democratic platform
evidently aroused protests from powerful quarters also the republicans quickly subsided when they saw the democrats making an advance and so the democratic executive committee began to spread abroad the news that its act was not really official
but merely reflected the personal conviction of the members present it extracted the official flavor and so of course no action followed in congress and so it went like a great game of chess
the fact was that the pickets had moved the democrats a step
behind this matching of political wits by the two parties stood the faithful pickets compelling them both to act simultaneously with these moves and counter moves in political circles the people in all sections of this vast country began to speak their minds
meetings were springing up everywhere at which resolutions were passed backing up the picket line and urging the president and congress to act even the south the administrations stronghold sent fiery telegrams demanding action
alabama south carolina texas maryland mississippi as well as the west middle west new england and the east the stream was endless every time a new piece of legislation was passed the war tax bill
food conservation or what not women from unex pected quarters sent to the government their protest against the passage of measures so vital to women without womens consent coupled with an appeal for the liberation of women
club women college women federations of labor various kinds of organizations sent protests to the administration leaders the picket line approaching its sixth month of duty had aroused the country to an unprecedented interest in suf frage
it had rallied widespread public support to the amend ment as a war measure and had itself become almost univer sally accepted if not universally approved and in the midst of picketing ands in spite of all the prophecies and fears that picketing would set back the cause
within one month michigan nebraska and rhode island granted presidential suffrage to women the leaders were busy marshaling their forces behind the presidents war program which included the controversial conscription and espionage bills then pending
and did not relish having our question so vivid in the public mind
they had to face a possible charge of inconsistency insincerity or bad faith the freedom of ireland for example was not in the program
the manifestations of popular approval of suffrage the constant stream of protests to the administration against its delay nationally and the shame of having women begging at its gates could result in only one of two things
the administration had little choice it must yield to this pressure from the people or it must suppress the agitation which was causing such interest it must pass the amendment or remove the troublesome pickets it decided to remove the pickets
the first arrests the administration chose suppression they resorted to force in an attempt to end picketing it was a policy doomed to failure as certainly as all resorts to force to kill agitation have failed ultimately
this marked the beginning of the adoption by the administration of tactics from which they could never extricate themselves with honor unfortunately for them they were entering upon this policy toward women which savored of czarist practices
at the very moment they were congratulating the russians upon their liberation from the oppression of a czar this fact supplied us with a fresh angle of attack president wilson sent a mission to russia to add americas appeal to that of the other allies to keep that impoverished country in the war
such was our democratic zeal to persuade russia to continue the war and to convince her people of its democratic purposes and of the democratic quality of america
this occasion offered us the opportunity again to expose the administrations weakness in claiming complete political democracy while women were still denied their political freedom
as the car carrying the envoys passed swiftly through the gates of the white house there stood on the picket line two silent sentinels miss lucy burns of new york and missus lawrence lewis of philadelphia both members of the national executive committee
with a great lettered banner which read to the russian envoys president wilson and envoy root are deceiving russia when they say we are a democracy help us win the world war so that democracy may survive we the women of america
twenty million ameri can women are denied the right to vote presi dent wilson is the chief opponent of their na tional enfranchisement help us make this nation really free tell our government it must liberate its people before it can claim free russia as an ally
rumors that the suffragists would make a special demonstration before the russian mission had brought a great crowd to the far gate of the white house a crowd composed almost entirely of men
like all crowds this crowd had its share of hoodlums and roughs who tried to interfere with the womens order of the day there was a flurry of excitement over this defiant message of truth but nothing that could not with the utmost ease have been settled by one policeman
there was the criticism in the press and on the lips of men that we were embarrassing our government before the eyes of foreign visitors in answering the criticism miss paul publicly stated our position thus
can be changed in the twinkling of an eye the responsibility for our protest is therefore with the administration and not with the women of america if the lack of democracy at home weakens the administration
in its fight for democracy three thousand miles away this was too dreadful a flurry at the gates of the chief of the nation at such a time would never do our allies in the crusade for democracy must not know that we had a day by day unrest at home
what a picture common decency told the more humane leaders that this would never do i daresay political wisdom crept into the reasoning of others closing the womans party headquarters was discussed perhaps a raid and all for what
because women were holding banners asking for the precious principle at home that men were supposed to be dying for abroad finally a decision was reached embodying the combined wisdom of all the various conferees
the chief of police major pullman was detailed to request us to stop picketing and to tell us that if we continued to picket we would be arrested we have picketed for six months without interference said miss paul has the law been changed
no was the reply but you must stop it
the following day miss lucy burns and miss katherine morey of boston carried to the white house gates we shall fight for the things we have always held nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority
to have a voice in their own government
news had spread through the city that the pickets were to be arrested a moderately large crowd had gathered to see the fun one has only to come into conflict with prevailing authority whether rightly or wrongly to find friendly hosts vanishing with lightning speed
to know that we were no longer wanted at the gates of the white house and that the police were no longer our friends was enough for the mob mind some members of the crowd made sport of the women others hurled cheap and childish epithets at them small boys were allowed to capture souvenirs
as trophies of the sport thinking they had been mistaken in believing the pickets were to be arrested and having grown weary of their strenuous sport the crowd moved on its way two solitary figures remained standing on the sidewalk flanked by the vast pennsylvania avenue
upon knowing the charge against them major pullman and his entire staff were utterly at a loss to know what to answer the administration had looked ahead only as far as threatening arrest they doubtless thought this was all they would have to do
and never brought to trial the following day june twenty third more arrests were made two women at the white house two at the capitol all carried banners with the same words of the president there was no hesitation this time they were promptly arrested for obstructing the traffic
they too were dismissed and their cases never tried
when however women continued to picket in the face of arrest the administration quickened its advance into the venture of suppression it decided to bring the offenders to trial on june twenty sixth
to pay a fine would be an admission of guilt we are innocent the six women who were privileged to serve the first terms of imprisonment for suffrage in this country were miss katherine morey of massachusetts missus annie arneil
and miss mabel vernon of delaware miss lavinia dock of pennsylvania miss maud
independence day july fourth nineteen seventeen is the occasion for two demonstrations in the name of liberty champ clark late democratic speaker of the house is declaiming to a cheering crowd behind the white house
governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed in front of the white house thirteen silent sentinels with banners bearing the same words are arrested it would have been exceedingly droll if it had not been so tragic
champ clark and his throng were not molested the women with practically a deserted street were arrested and served jail terms for obstructing traffic the trial of this group was delayed to give the jail authorities time to vacate and tidy up
as one prisoner confided to miss joy young it developed that orders had been received at the jail immediately after the arrests and before the trial to make ready for the suffragettes what did it matter that their case had not yet been heard
and was not the chief of police of the district of columbia a direct appointee of these same commissioners and was not the jail warden who made life for the women so unbearable in prison also a direct appointee of the commissioners
it was all a merry little ring and its cavalier attitude toward the law toward justice and above all toward women was of no importance the world was on fire with a grand blaze this tiny flame would scarcely be visible
chairman furnished without charge to all newspapers post offices government officials and agencies of a public character for the dissemination of official news of the united states government washington july third nineteen seventeen
and reporters not to encourage us in our peculiar conduct by printing defies to the president of the united states even when flaunted on a pretty little purple and gold banner and exhorts the public to control its thrills
the official bulletin concludes with it is a fact that there remains in america one man who has known exactly the right attitude to take and maintain toward the pickets
a polite bow and for the rest a complete ignoring of their existence he happens to be the man around whom the little whirlwind
and finally with an admonition that the rest of the country
august riots imprisoning women had met with considerable public disapproval and attendant political embarrassment to the administration that the presidential pardon would end this embarrassment was doubtless the hope of the administration
the pickets however returned to their posts in steadily increasing numbers their presence at the gates was desired by the administration no more now than it had been before the arrests and imprisonments but they had found no way to rid themselves of the pickets
and as another month of picketing drew to an end the administration ventured to try other ways to stop it and with it the consequent embarrassment their methods became physically more brutal and politically more stupid their conduct
became lawless in the extreme meanwhile the president had drafted the young men of america in their millions to die on foreign soil for foreign democracy he had issued a special appeal to women to give their work their treasure and their sons to this enterprise
at the same time his now gigantic figure stood obstinately across the path to our main objective it was our daily task to keep vividly in his mind that objective it was our responsibility to compel decisive action from him
twenty million american women are not self governed take the beam out of your own eye we did not expect public sympathy at this point we knew that not even the members of congress who had occasionally in debate but more frequently in their cloak rooms
president and missus wilson passed through the gates on their way to a military review at fort myer the president saw american women being attacked while the police refused them protection not a move was made by the police to control the growing crowd
such inaction is always a signal for more violence on the part of rowdies as the throng moved to and fro between the white house and our headquarters immediately opposite so many banners were destroyed that finally miss lucy burns miss virginia arnold
and miss elizabeth stuyvesant took those remaining to the second and third floor balconies of our building and hung them out at this point there was not a picket left on the street the crowd was clearly obstructing the traffic but no attempt was made to move them back or to protect the women
climbed up to the second floor balcony mounted the iron railing and tore down all banners and the american flag one sailor administered a severe blow in the face with his clenched fist upon miss georgina sturgis of washington why did you do that she demanded
and still no attempt by the police to quell the riot the climax came when in the late afternoon a bullet was fired through one of the heavy glass windows of the second floor embedding itself in the ceiling the bullet grazed past the head of missus ella morton dean of montana
captain flather of the first precinct with two detectives later examined the holes and declared they had been made by a thirty eight caliber revolver
but the police looked on while all the banners were destroyed a few paces from headquarters more banners went out purple white and gold ones they too were destroyed before they reached the white house
this entire spectacle was enacted on august fourteenth within a stones throw of the white house miss paul summed up the situation when she said the situation now existing in washington exists because president wilson permits it
asking questions making brief testimonials from the floor with almost evangelical fervor improvised collection baskets were piled high with bills women volunteered for picket duty and certain imprisonment
and the following day a delegation left for washington i cite this experience of mine because it was typical every one who went through the country telling the story had similar experiences at this time indignation was swift and hot
our mass meetings everywhere became meetings of protest during the entire campaign and resolutions of protest which always went immediately by wire from such meetings to the president his cabinet and to his leaders in congress of course created increasing
uneasiness in democratic circles on august fifteenth the pickets again attempted to take their posts on the line on this day one lettered banner and fifty purple white and gold flags were destroyed by a mob led by sailors in uniform
by a sailor who took her flag and then darted off into the crowd miss elizabeth stuyvesant was struck by a soldier in uniform and her blouse torn from her body miss maud jamison of virginia was knocked down and dragged along the sidewalk
the flying stars the most beautiful crime i ever committed flambeau would say in his highly moral old age
was also by a singular coincidence my last it was committed at christmas as an artist
i had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which i found myself choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe as if for a statuary group
thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak while jews on the other hand should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless
among the lights and screens of the cafe riche thus in england if i wished to relieve a dean of his riches which is not so easy as you might suppose i wished to frame him
if i make myself clear in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral town similarly in france when i had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant
which is almost impossible it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars and those solemn plains of gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of millet
well my last crime was a christmas crime a cheery cosy english middle class crime a crime of charles dickens
i did it in a good old middle class house near putney a house with a crescent of carriage drive a house with a stable by the side of it a house with the name on the two outer gates
a house with a monkey tree enough you know the species i really think my imitation of dickenss style was dexterous and literary it seems almost a pity
i repented the same evening flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside and even from the inside it was odd seen from the outside
it was perfectly incomprehensible and it is from the outside that the stranger must study it from this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the front doors of the house with the stable
opened on the garden with the monkey tree and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the afternoon of boxing day she had a pretty face with brave brown eyes
but her figure was beyond conjecture for she was so wrapped up in brown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur but for the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear
the winter afternoon was reddening towards evening and already a ruby light was rolled over the bloomless beds filling them as it were with the ghosts of the dead roses
on one side of the house stood the stable on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden behind the young lady having scattered bread for the birds
for the fourth or fifth time that day because the dog ate it passed unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of evergreens behind
here she gave an exclamation of wonder real or ritual and looking up at the high garden wall above her beheld it fantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure
oh dont jump mister crook she called out in some alarm its much too high the individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse
was a tall angular young man with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush intelligent and even distinguished lineaments but a sallow and almost alien complexion
this showed the more plainly because he wore an aggressive red tie the only part of his costume of which he seemed to take any care perhaps it was a symbol
he took no notice of the girls alarmed adjuration but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her where he might very well have broken his legs i think i was meant to be a burglar
he said placidly and i have no doubt i should have been if i hadnt happened to be born in that nice house next door i cant see any harm in it anyhow
how can you say such things she remonstrated well said the young man if youre born on the wrong side of the wall i cant see that its wrong to climb over it
i never know what you will say or do next she said i dont often know myself replied mister crook but then i am on the right side of the wall now
and which is the right side of the wall asked the young lady smiling whichever side you are on said the young man named crook
as they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor horn sounded thrice coming nearer and nearer and a car of splendid speed great elegance
and stood throbbing hullo hullo said the young man with the red tie heres somebody born on the right side anyhow i didnt know miss adams that your santa claus was so modern as this
oh thats my godfather sir leopold fischer he always comes on boxing day then after an innocent pause which unconsciously betrayed some lack of enthusiasm
ruby adams added he is very kind john crook journalist had heard of that eminent city magnate and it was not his fault if the city magnate
had not heard of him for in certain articles in the clarion or the new age sir leopold had been dealt with austerely but he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the motor car
which was rather a long process a large neat chauffeur in green got out from the front and a small neat manservant in grey got out from the back and between them they deposited sir leopold on the doorstep
and began to unpack him like some very carefully protected parcel rugs enough to stock a bazaar furs of all the beasts of the forest and scarves of all the colours of the rainbow
were unwrapped one by one till they revealed something resembling the human form the form of a friendly but foreign looking old gentleman with a grey goat like beard and a beaming smile
who rubbed his big fur gloves together long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch had opened in the middle and colonel adams father of the furry young lady
had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside he was a tall sunburnt and very silent man who wore a red smoking cap like a fez making him look like one of the english sirdars
or pashas in egypt with him was his brother in law lately come from canada a big and rather boisterous young gentleman farmer with a yellow beard by name james blount
with him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighbouring roman church for the colonels late wife had been a catholic and the children as is common in such cases had been trained to follow her
everything seemed undistinguished about the priest even down to his name which was brown yet the colonel had always found something companionable about him and frequently asked him to such family gatherings
in the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for sir leopold and the removal of his wraps porch and vestibule indeed
were unduly large in proportion to the house and formed as it were a big room with the front door at one end and the bottom of the staircase at the other in front of the large hall fire
over which hung the colonels sword the process was completed and the company including the saturnine crook presented to sir leopold fischer that venerable financier however
still seemed struggling with portions of his well lined attire and at length produced from a very interior tail coat pocket a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his christmas present for his god daughter
with an unaffected vain glory that had something disarming about it he held out the case before them all it flew open at a touch and half blinded them
it was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in their eyes in a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them
fischer stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the colonel the wonder of the whole group
i had to be careful of em coming down theyre the three great african diamonds called the flying stars because theyve been stolen so often all the big criminals are on the track
but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them i might have lost them on the road here it was quite possible quite natural i should say
growled the man in the red tie i shouldnt blame em if they had taken em when they ask for bread and you dont even give them a stone i think they might take the stone for themselves
i wont have you talking like that cried the girl who was in a curious glow youve only talked like that since you became a horrid whats his name you know what i mean
a saint said father brown i think said sir leopold with a supercilious smile that ruby means a socialist
a radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes remarked crook with some impatience and a conservative does not mean a man who preserves jam neither i assure you
does a socialist mean a man who desires a social evening with the chimney sweep a socialist means a man who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney sweeps paid for it but who wont allow you
put in the priest in a low voice to own your own soot crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect does one want to own soot he asked one might
with speculation in his eye ive heard that gardeners use it and i once made six children happy at christmas when the conjuror didnt come entirely with soot applied externally
oh splendid cried ruby oh i wish youd do it to this company the boisterous canadian mister blount was lifting his loud voice in applause
and the astonished financier his in some considerable deprecation when a knock sounded at the double front doors the priest opened them and they showed again the front garden of evergreens monkey tree and all
now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset the scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint like a back scene in a play that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the door
he was dusty looking and in a frayed coat evidently a common messenger any of you gentlemen mister blount he asked and held forward a letter doubtfully
mister blount started and stopped in his shout of assent ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it his face clouded a little and then cleared and he turned to his brother in law and host
im sick at being such a nuisance colonel he said with the cheery colonial conventions but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business in point of fact its florian
that famous french acrobat and comic actor i knew him years ago out west he was a french canadian by birth and he seems to have business for me though i hardly guess what
of course of course replied the colonel carelessly my dear chap any friend of yours no doubt he will prove an acquisition
hell black his face if thats what you mean cried blount laughing i dont doubt hed black everyone elses eyes i dont care im not refined
i like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat not on mine please said sir leopold fischer with dignity well well observed crook airily
dont lets quarrel there are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat dislike of the red tied youth born of his predatory opinions and evident intimacy with the pretty godchild
led fischer to say in his most sarcastic magisterial manner no doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat what is it pray
letting a top hat sit on you for instance said the socialist now now now cried the canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence dont lets spoil a jolly evening
what i say is lets do something for the company tonight not blacking faces or sitting on hats if you dont like those but something of the sort why couldnt we have a proper old english pantomime
clown columbine and so on i saw one when i left england at twelve years old and its blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since i came back to the old country only last year
and i find the things extinct nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays i want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages and they give me princesses moralising by moonlight blue birds
or something blue beards more in my line and him i like best when he turned into the pantaloon im all for making a policeman into sausages said john crook
its a better definition of socialism than some recently given but surely the get up would be too big a business not a scrap cried blount quite carried away
a harlequinades the quickest thing we can do for two reasons first one can gag to any degree and second all the objects are household things
tables and towel horses and washing baskets and things like that thats true admitted crook nodding eagerly and walking about but im afraid i cant have my policemans uniform
havent killed a policeman lately blount frowned thoughtfully a space and then smote his thigh yes we can he cried ive got florians address here
and he knows every costumier in london ill phone him to bring a police dress when he comes and he went bounding away to the telephone oh its glorious godfather
almost dancing ill be columbine and you shall be pantaloon the millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity i think my dear he said
you must get someone else for pantaloon i will be pantaloon if you like said colonel adams taking his cigar out of his mouth and speaking for the first and last time
you ought to have a statue cried the canadian as he came back radiant from the telephone there we are all fitted mister crook shall be clown
hes a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes i can be harlequin that only wants long legs and jumping about my friend florian phones hes bringing the police costume hes changing on the way
we can act it in this very hall the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite one row above another these front doors can be the back scene either open or shut shut
you see an english interior open a moonlit garden it all goes by magic and snatching a chance piece of billiard chalk from his pocket he ran it across the hall floor
half way between the front door and the staircase to mark the line of the footlights how even such a banquet of bosh was got ready in the time remained a riddle
but they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry that lives when youth is in a house and youth was in that house that night though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from which it flamed
as always happens the invention grew wilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had to create the columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt
that strangely resembled the large lamp shade in the drawing room the clown and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook and red with rouge from some other domestic who remained
like all true christian benefactors anonymous the harlequin already clad in silver paper out of cigar boxes was with difficulty
prevented from smashing the old victorian lustre chandeliers that he might cover himself with resplendent crystals in fact he would certainly have done so had not ruby unearthed some old pantomime paste jewels
she had worn at a fancy dress party as the queen of diamonds indeed her uncle james blount was getting almost out of hand in his excitement he was like a schoolboy
he put a paper donkeys head unexpectedly on father brown who bore it patiently and even found some private manner of moving his ears he even essayed to put the paper donkeys tail
to the coat tails of sir leopold fischer this however was frowned down uncle is too absurd cried ruby to crook round whose shoulders she had seriously placed a string of sausages
why is he so wild he is harlequin to your columbine said crook i am only the clown who makes the old jokes i wish you were the harlequin
she said and left the string of sausages swinging father brown though he knew every detail done behind the scenes and had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime baby
went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee the spectators were few relations one or two local friends
and now said coronel wed better decide what to do but i dont mind what we do now said hyacinth happily she may have the throne and father and udo and
thats what makes it so jolly we can do what we like and it doesnt matter if it doesnt come off so just for fun lets think of something to pay her out i feel i dont want to hurt anybody to day all right we wont hurt her well humour her
we will be her most humble obedient servants she shall have everything she wants including prince udo smiled hyacinth thats a splendid idea well make her have udo
it will annoy your father but one cant please everybody oh i can see myself enjoying this they got up and wandered back along wiggss path hand in hand im almost afraid to leave the forest said hyacinth
in case something happens what should happen i dont know but all our life together has been in the forest and im just a little afraid of the world
be very close coronel she whispered and then they walked out together if any of the servants at the palace were surprised to see coronel they did not show it after all that was their business
prince coronel will be staying here said the princess prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both and if they discussed those things in the servants halls of those days
no doubt they told each other that the princess hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last
but i get no assistance from roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders i say said coronel as they went up the grand staircase i am not a prince you know dont say i have deceived you
you are my prince said hyacinth proudly my dear i am a king among men to day and you are my queen but thats in our own special country of two if you are so particular said hyacinth with a smile
father will make you a proper prince directly he comes back will he thats what im wondering you see he doesnt know yet about our little present to the countess but it is quite time we got back to belvane we have left her alone too long
it was more than udo did just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with a dragon apparently in its dotage to which belvane was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator
and then said udo i jumped quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later i jumped quickly to my left yes i remember it now it was my left i jumped quickly to my left and whirling my
he stopped suddenly at the expression on belvanes face she was looking over his shoulder at something behind him why whoever is this she said getting to her feet before udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon
the princess and coronel were upon them ah countess i thought we should find you together said hyacinth archly let me present to you my friend the duke coronel
udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered highness on the back arent you udo and i can think of no one more suitable in every way he bowed again and turned back to the prince well udo youre looking splendid
a different thing countess from when i last saw him
ah what a miracle worker true love is i think one of the things which made belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say
meanwhile udo of course blundered along gaily we arent exactly princess i mean what are you doing here coronel i didnt know princess that you
the countess and i were just having a little i was just telling her what you said about how did you get here coronel shall we tell him said coronel with a smile at hyacinth hyacinth nodded
i rode said coronel its a secret he added
explained hyacinth and hearing that there was to be a wedding added coronel belvane made up her mind coronel was evidently a very different man from udo if he stayed in euralia as adviser
more than adviser she guessed to hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt and as for the king it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her
we didnt want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your royal highness she looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lovers hand went on
udo and i here she squeezed the hand and finding it was coronels took udos boldly without any more maidenly nonsense udo and i love each other say something udo
prompted coronel er yes said udo very unwillingly and deciding he would explain it all afterwards whatever his feelings for the countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage oh im so glad
said hyacinth i felt somehow that it must be coming because youve seen so much of each other lately wiggs and i have often talked about it together what has happened to the child thought belvane she isnt a child at all shes grown up
theres no holding udo once he begins volunteered coronel hes the most desperate lover in araby my father will be so excited when he hears said hyacinth
you know of course that his majesty comes back to morrow with all his army she did not swoon or utter a cry she did not plead the vapours or the megrims
she took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life then perhaps i had better see that everything is ready in the palace she said if your royal highness will excuse me
and with a curtsey she was gone coronel exchanged a glance with hyacinth im enjoying this he seemed to say well she announced i must be going in too therell be much to see about
and now said the prince tell me what you are doing here coronel put his arm in udos and walked him up and down the flagged path your approaching marriage
he said is the talk of araby naturally i had to come here to see for myself what she was like my dear udo shes charming i congratulate you dont be a fool coronel i havent the slightest intention of marrying her
there hasnt been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now
yes i think you may take our word for it that its true i havent the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for
oh very well if youre going to drop all your former friends go on then but when im married there will always be a place for understand once and for all said udo angrily that i am not getting married no dont take my arm
we can talk quite well like this i am sorry udo said coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake but you must admit we found you in a very compromising position it wasnt in the least compromising
protested udo indignantly
ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that
once more i am not going to marry her well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story poor innocent girl well lets forget about it and now tell me how do you like euralia
said udo stiffly well perhaps youre right i hope that nothing will happen to you on the way udo who was about to enter the palace turned round with a startled look what do you mean
you never told me your precious countess whom you expect me to marry how very unkind of her a nasty person to annoy he was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully
udo evidently hadnt thought of this he tried to show that he was not in the least frightened she couldnt do anything
yes but of course the chance might come again youd have the thing hanging over you always shes clever you know and i should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy lovely flowers arent they whats the name of this one
udo dropped undecidedly into a seat this wanted thinking out the countess what was wrong with her after all and she evidently adored him of course that was not surprising the question was
was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for after all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman it was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions
of course he ought to have left euralia long ago but he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that and he had certainly neglected the princess a little
after all again why not marry the countess it was absurd to suppose there was anything in coronels nonsense but one never knew not that he was marrying her out of fear no certainly not it was simply a chivalrous whim on his part
the poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed she seems fond of flowers said coronel you ought to make the palace garden look beautiful between you now understand clearly coronel
im not in the least frightened by the countess my dear udo what a speech for a lover of course youre not after all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again
i must ask you not to refer to it if i marry the countess youll be a very lucky man put in coronel i happen to know that the king of euralia however shes chosen you it seems
personally i cant make out what she sees in you what is it i should have thought it was quite obvious said udo with dignity well coronel i think perhaps you are right and that its my duty to marry her
coronel shook him solemnly by the hand i congratulate your royal highness i will announce your decision to the princess she will be much amu much delighted and he turned into the palace
a contemporary poet of the country king merriwig the first rode back from war as many other kings had done before five hundred men behind him were in sight left right left right left right left right left right
so far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius to be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men
henry smallnose a bowman of considerable promise had been left behind in the enemys country the one casualty of war while spying out the land in the early days of the invasion
he had been discovered by the chief armourer of barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks the chief armourer a kindly man
henry having caught a glimpse of the chief armourers daughter had accepted without any false pride and had frequently dropped in to supper thereafter now that the war was over he found that he could not tear himself away
with king merriwigs permission he was settling in barodia and with the chief armourers permission he was starting on his new life as a married man as the towers of the castle came in sight merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness home again
were in his pocket days of honoured leisure were waiting for him he gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country his heart overflowing with thankfulness never again would he leave euralia how good to see hyacinth again
poor little hyacinth left all alone but there she had had the countess belvane a woman of great experience to help her belvane should he risk it how much had she thought of him while he was away
hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon life would be lonely in euralia then unless should he risk it
he must be longing to tell you that oh hell have a hundred things to tell you first but then when he says and whats been happening here while ive been away nothing much i suppose then you can say
then i shall say nothing much only coronel and such a clever oh i have my ideas said coronel well ill be out of the way somewhere i think ill go for a walk in the forest
or shall i stay here in the countesss garden and amuse myself with udo anyhow ill give you an hour alone together first the cavalcade drew up in front of the castle handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls trumpets were blown hounds bayed
down the steps came hyacinth all blue and gold and flung herself into her fathers arms my dear child said merriwig as he patted her soothingly there there its your old father come back again hrm there there
he patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down my little hyacinth my own little girl oh father i am glad to have you back there there my child
he took a step forward and addressed his troops men of euralia cheers we have returned from a long and arduous conflict cheers to the embraces loud cheers
of our mothers and wives and daughters prolonged cheering as the case may be hear hear
in honour of our great victory i decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout euralia terrific cheering
here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye travelled over her shoulder in the direction of belvanes garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame
there was another storm of cheers the battle cry of euralia ho ho merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes hyacinth and merriwig went into the palace
now father said hyacinth later on when merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself youve got to tell me all about it i can hardly believe its really over yes yes its all over
said merriwig heartily we shant have any trouble in that direction again i fancy do tell me did the king of barodia apologise he did better than that he abdicated why
well said merriwig remembering just in time i er killed him oh father how rough of you i dont think it hurt him very much my dear
see i have brought these home for you he produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper oh how exciting whatever can it be merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers
neatly tied up with blue ribbon father he picked out the left one fons et origo if he had known any latin of the war and held it up for hyacinths inspection there you can see the place where henry smallnoses arrow bent it
by the way he added henry is marrying and settling down in barodia it is curious he went on how after a war ones thoughts turn to matrimony he glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this
but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
i cant plant them in the garden i thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in barodia isnt that a little unkind now that the poor mans dead merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers
can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously of course said hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told coronel well then listen
he told her of his secret journey to the king of barodias tent he told her of the king of barodias letter
and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent
to hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings and by and by the moment came of which coronel had spoken and now said merriwig
nothing much i suppose he waited nervously wondering if hyacinth would realise that all was meant to include more particularly belvane hyacinth drew a stool up to her fathers chair and sat down very close to him
father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee i have got some news for you nothing about the coun nothing serious i hope said merriwig in alarm
its rather serious but its rather nice father dear would you mind very much if i got married soon my dear you shall get married as soon as you like let me see there were six or seven princes who came about it only the other day
i sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now i suppose you havent heard anything of them no father said hyacinth with a little smile ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful
no matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately well arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighbouring countries therell be no lack of candidates
let me see theres that seven headed bull hes getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one we might i dont want a suitor said hyacinth softly i have one merriwig leant forward with eagerness
my dear this is indeed news tell me all about it upon what quest did you send him hyacinth had felt this coming
what is his income a man must prove his worth in some way i havent sent him away at all yet she said hes only just come hes been very kind to me and im sure youll love him well well well arrange something for him
by the way who is he he comes from araby and his name is udo of course why didnt i think of him an excellent arrangement my dear it isnt udo im afraid father its coronel
and who might coronel be said the king rather sternly hes hes well hes here he is father she ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door
oh coronel youre just in time do tell father who you are coronel bowed profoundly to the king before i explain myself your majesty he said
may i congratulate your majesty on your wonderful victory over the barodians from the little i have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred but of course i am longing to hear the full story from your majestys own lips
is it a fact that your majesty made his way at dead of night to the king of barodias own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him there was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it
he seemed to be envying the king such an adventure an adventure after his own heart merriwig was in an awkward position he wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room leave us my child
he would say these are matters for men to discuss but hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell coronel the truth of the matter afterwards it really looked as if coronel would have to be let into the secret too
there are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about pardon your majesty i have no wish to but as you know so much you may as well know all
it happened like this once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the kings letter to him but your majesty cried coronel
so you like it said merriwig trying to look modest i love it i knew hed love it put in hyacinth its just the sort of story that coronel would love
tell him about how you fought the king at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how could any father have resisted in a little while hyacinth and coronel were seated eagerly at his feet
and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures well well said the king at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in war time he turned to coronel
and so you i understand wish to marry my daughter does that surprise your majesty well no it doesnt and she i understand wishes to marry you yes please father
that said coronel simply is much more surprising merriwig however was not so sure of that he liked the look of coronel he liked his manner
and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one of course he said youll have to win her anything your majesty sets me to do its as well he added with a disarming smile
that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the king of barodia there is only one man who could have got those truly an excellent young man well well arrange something said merriwig looking pleased
perhaps your prince udo would care to be a competitor too hyacinth and coronel interchanged a smile alas father she said his royal highness is not attracted by my poor charms
wait till he has seen them my dear said merriwig with a chuckle he has seen them father what you invited him here
he came to stay with you and he never his royal highness put in coronel has given his affections to another aha so thats the secret now i wonder if i can guess who she is
what do you say to the princess elvira of tregong i know his father had hopes in that direction hyacinth looked round at coronel as if appealing for his support he took a step towards her
no its not the princess elvira said hyacinth a little nervously the king laughed good humouredly ah well you must tell me he said
hyacinth put out her hand and coronel pressed it encouragingly his royal highness prince udo she said
but by the end of the two weeks she grew tired of waiting and the days were so very long that at length not without some slight compunction she made up her mind to go and pay a guileless visit to miss priscilla gower herself
i am going to see miss gower aunt she ventured to say one morning at the breakfast table
whats that leonora he said going to see the stern vestal are you priscilla eh lady throckmorton shrugged her shoulders in an indifferent sarcasm she was often both sarcastic and indifferent in her manner toward sir dugald
theos in goings and out goings are scarcely our business so long as she enjoys herself she said present my regards to the miss gowers my dear and say i regret that my health does not permit me to accompany you a polite fiction by the way as my lady was looking her best
albeit the fat gray horses and fat gray coachman did occasionally recognize the existence of that remote locality
and in her pleasure at seeing him that young lady forgot both herself and sir dugald and exclaimed aloud oh mister oglethorpe she cried out i am so glad and then stopped in a confusion and trepidation absolutely brilliant
he came to the window and looked in at her are you coming to see priscilla he said lady throckmorton said i might she answered the warmth in her face chilled by his unenthusiastic though kindly tone she did not know what a struggle it cost him to face her thus carelessly all at once
he did not even open the carriage door himself but waited for the footman to do it priscilla will be glad to see you he said quietly i will go into the house again with you the dwarfed sitting room looked very much as it had looked on theos first introduction to it
but on this occasion miss elizabeth was not arrayed in the snuff colored satin and when they entered priscilla was kneeling down upon the hearth rug straightening out an obstreperous fold in it she rose collectedly at once and as her face turned toward them
theo was struck with some fancy of its being a shade paler than it had been the last time she had seen it but her manner was not changed in the least and she welcomed her visitor with grave cordiality poor little snuff colored miss elizabeth was delighted
she was getting very fond of company in her old age and had taken a great fancy to theodora north send the carriage away and stay with us until evening miss theodora she fluttered in wild old maidenly excitement
do stay miss theodora and i will show you how to do the octagon stitch as i promised the last time you were here you remember how you admired it in that antimacassar i was making for priscilla miss elizabeths chief delight and occupation was the making of miraculously gorgeous mysteries for priscilla
and theos modest eulogies of her last piece of work had won her admiration and regard at once consequently under stress of miss elizabeth the carriage was fain to depart much to the abasement of the fat gray coachman who felt himself much dishonored in finding he was compelled
not only to pay majestic calls to broome street but to acknowledge the humiliating fact of friendly visits we must have a fire in the best parlor my dear chirped elizabeth ecstatically when theos hat and jacket were being carried out of the room
she was particularly reminded of it by the ceremonious repairing to the fire in the front parlor where everything was so orderly and even the family portraits had the appearance of family portraits roused from a deep reverie to be surprised at an intrusion
my late lamented parents my dear said miss elizabeth rubbing her spectacles and admiringly regarding an owl like elderly gentleman in an aggressive brown wig and an equally owl like lady in a self announcing false front embarrassingly suggestive of miss elizabeths own
my late lamented parents at the respective ages of fifty and fifty seven my sister anastasia my only brother my sister in law his wife and my dear priscilla at seventeen years theo turned from the others to look at this last with a deeper interest
she had a pale handsome ungirlish face a minerva face steady grave handsome eyes and a fine head unadorned save with a classic knot of black brown hair the picture was not even younger looking than priscilla was now
miss elizabeth regarded it in affectionate admiration of its beauty my dear she said to theodora that is the most beautiful face in london to my old eyes it reminds me of my dear anastasia in her youth i was always glad my brother benjamins daughter was not like his wife
we were not fond of my brother benjamins wife she was a very giddy young person and very fond of gayety she died of lung fever contracted through exposing herself one night at a military ball in direct opposition to my brother benjamins wishes
she insisted upon wearing blue satin slippers and a low necked dress oh dear said theodora secretly conscious of a guilty sympathy for the giddy young person who ran counter to brother benjamins wishes in the matter of military balls and blue satin slippers
yes my love miss elizabeth proceeded and for that reason i was always glad to find that priscilla was not at all like her priscilla and i have been very happy together in our quiet way she has been the best of dear good girls to me
indeed i really dont know what i shall do when i must lose her as of course you know i shall be obliged to when she marries mister denis oglethorpe yes maam answered theo and as she spoke she felt a curious startled glow flash over her
this was the first time an actual approach to the subject had been made in her presence yes my dear said miss elizabeth again i shall feel the separation very deeply but it must be you know they have waited so long for each other that i should be a very wicked selfish old woman to throw any obstacle
eulogizing priscilla and her betrothed affectionately mister denis oglethorpe would be a rich man some of these days and then what a happy life must priscillas be so young so beautiful so beloved not that wealth brings happiness my dear miss theodora
riches are very deceitful you know but there is a great deal of solid comfort in a genteel sufficiency to all of which theo acquiesced modestly inwardly wondering if she was very wrong in wishing that oglethorpe had not left them quite so early
the day passed pleasantly enough however in a quiet way miss elizabeth was very affectionate and communicative and told her a great many stories of anastasia and the late lamented benjamin as they sat by the fire together in the evening and blundered over the octagon stitch
it was an afghan miss elizabeth was making now and when at tea time mister oglethorpe came he found theodora north sitting on the hearth flushed with industrious anxiety and thrown into reflected glow of brilliant berlin wool a beautiful young spider in a gorgeous afghan web
her letters were never careless or behind time and no one was ever neglected in the multiplicity of messages she would be the most truthful and faithful of loving women a few years hence this handsome theodora there was some reserve in her manner toward denis this evening
she attended to miss elizabeths octagon stitch and left him to amuse priscilla he had not seemed very much pleased to see her in the morning and besides priscilla was plainly his business but when the carriage was announced and she returned to the parlor after an absence of a few minutes
drawing on her gloves and buttoning her pretty jacket close up to her beautiful slender dusky throat denis took his hat and accompanied her to the carriage he did not wait for the footman this time but after assisting her to get in closed the door himself
and nothing on earth could prevent it business has unexpectedly called me away from london from england he explained in a strange yet quite steady voice i am obliged to go to belgium at once
and my affairs are in such a condition that i may be compelled to remain across the channel for some time be good enough to say to lady throckmorton that i regret deeply that i could not see her before going but but the news has been sudden and my time is fully occupied
but i will write to her from my first stopping place i will tell her said theodora thank you he replied courteously and then after a short hesitation began again in the tone he used so often the tone that might be jest or earnest
and now there is something else a subject upon which i wish to ask your unbiased opinion my dear theodora before i say good bye when a man finds himself in a danger with which he cannot combat and remain human
in danger where defeat means dishonor do you not agree with me that the safest plan that man can adopt is to run away her quickened heart might almost have been running a life and death race with her leaping pulse but she answered him almost steadily
this morning when you spoke to me through the carriage window you began to say something about being glad were you going to say he broke off here sharply no he exclaimed i will not ask you i was going to say that i was glad to see you theo interrupted gravely
i was glad to see you and now perhaps you had better tell the coachman to drive on i will deliver your message to lady throckmorton and as i shall not see you again unless i am here in july of course you will come back then good bye mister oglethorpe
she gave him her hand through the carriage window and for a moment he held it to all appearance quite calm as he looked down at the lovely face the flare of an adjacent gaslight revealed to him against a background of shadow
mister denis oglethorpe has gone away he will not come back again until july when he is to marry miss gower this was the last entry recorded in the little pink and gold journal and after it came a gap of months
it was midnight after the memorable day spent in broome street that the record was made and having made it theodora north shut the book with a startled feeling that she had shut within its pages an unfinished page of her life it was a strange feeling to have come upon her so suddenly
it was startling it had come upon her without a moments warning it seemed and yet if she had been conscious of it there had been warning enough warning enough for an older woman warning enough for denis oglethorpe
but it had not seemed warning to a girl of scarcely seventeen years but she understood it now she had understood it the moment he told her in that strained steady voice that he was going away she had delivered his message to lady throckmorton
and listened quietly to her wandering comments answering them as best she could she had waited patiently until sir dugalds barbarous eleven oclock supper was over and then she had gone to her room stirred the fire and dropped down upon the hearth rug to think it over
she thought over it for a long time her handsome eyes brooding over the red coals but after about half an hour she spoke out aloud to the silence of the room he loved me she said he loved me me poor priscilla
that she would rather lose him knowing he loved her than win him feeling uncertain the glow in her eyes died away in tears but she was too young to realize despair or anything like it the truth was that the curious enchantment of the day had not been altogether sad
and at seventeen one does not comprehend that fate can be wholly bitter or that some turn in fortune is not in store for the future however hopeless the present may seem in this mood the entry was made in the little journal and having made it theodora north cried a little hoped a little
and wondered guilelessly how matters could end with perfect justice to priscilla gower the household seemed rather quiet after the change mister denis oglethorpe was a man to be missed under any circumstances and theo was not the only one who missed him
lady throckmorton missed him also but she had the solace of her novels and her chocolate which theo had not novels had been delightful at downport when they were read in hourly fear of the tasks that always interfered to prevent any indulgence
but in those days for some reason they were not as satisfactory as they appeared once and so being thrown on her own resources she succumbed to the very natural girlish weakness of feeling a sort of fascination for broome street it was hard to resist broome street
this was a curious consolation the two spent hours together sometimes in the tiny parlor stumbling over berlin wool difficulties and now and then wandering to and fro conversationally from priscilla to the octagon stitch and from the octagon stitch to denis
and she was sure her pale handsome face was paler though of course that was easily to be accounted for by her lovers absence she was a singular girl this priscilla gower the first time theo ever saw her display an interest in anybody or in anything
was when she first heard pamelas love story mentioned she was sitting at work near them when theo chanced to mention arthur brunwalde and to her surprise priscilla looked up from her desk immediately he was your sisters lover was he not she said with an abrupt interest in the subject
yes answered theo but he died you know priscilla nodded the week before their wedding day she said mister oglethorpe told me so theo answered in the affirmative again and poor pam could not forget him she added
no she replied almost timidly pamela is fairer than i am and not so tall we are not alike at all i was not thinking of that said priscilla i was wondering if you were alike in disposition i think i was wondering most whether you would be as faithful as pamela
i remember hearing mister oglethorpe say once you would be theo dropped her ivory crochet needle and bent to pick it up with a blurred vision and nervous fingers i cannot tell she said
you are seventeen said priscilla i knew at seventeen theo recovered the needle and reset it in her work to give herself time and then she looked up and faced her questioner bravely in a sort of desperateness if i knew that i loved any one
if i had ever loved any one as pamela loved mister brunwalde i should be like pamela she said i should never love any one else from that time she fancied that priscilla gower liked her better than she had done before at any rate she took more notice of her though she was never effusive of course
she talked to her oftener and seemed to listen while she talked even though she was busy at the time she said to her once that she would like to know pamela and emboldened by this theo ventured to bring one of pams letters to read to her
and when she had read it told the whole story of her sisters generosity in a little burst of enthusiastic love and gratitude
that fairly melted tender hearted old miss elizabeth to tears and caused her to confide afterward to theo the fact that she herself had felt the influence of the tender passion in consequence of the blandishments of a single gentleman of uncertain age
whose performances upon the flute had been the means of winning her affections but had unhappily resulted in his contracting a fatal cold while serenading on a damp evening he used to play in a cottage near a wood my dear most beautifully said miss elizabeth wild with pathos
though i regret to say that as we did not live in a musical neighborhood the people next door did not appreciate it the gentleman of the house even going so far as to say that he was not sorry when he died as he did a few weeks after the cold settled on his dear weak lungs
he was the only lover i ever had my dear theodora and his name was elderberry a very singular name by the way but he was a very talented man when theo went into the little back bedroom that evening to put on her hat priscilla gower went with her
and as she stood before the dressing table buttoning her sacque she was somewhat puzzled by the expression on her companions face priscilla had taken up her muff and was stroking the white fur her eyes downcast upon her hand as it moved to and fro the ring upon its forefinger shining in the gaslight
i had a letter from mister oglethorpe yesterday priscilla said at last he is in vienna now he asked if you were well to night i shall answer him have you any message to send i said theo it seemed to her so strange a thing for miss priscilla gower to say
that her pronoun was almost an interjection i thought perhaps said priscilla quietly that a message from you would gratify him if you had one to send theo took up her gloves and began to draw them on a sudden feeling of pain or discomfort striking her
it was a feeling scarcely defined enough to allow her to decide whether it was real pain or only discomfort i do not think i have any message to send she replied thank you miss priscilla she took her muff then
and went back to the parlor to kiss miss elizabeth in a strange frame of mind she was beginning to feel more strangely concerning mister denis oglethorpe and it was priscilla gower who had stirred her heart she found lady throckmorton waiting at home for her to her surprise in a new mood
she had that evening received a letter from denis herself and it had suggested an idea to her i have been thinking theo she said that we might take a run over the channel ourselves i have not been in paris for four years and i believe the change would do me good
the last time i visited the spas my health improved greatly it was just like her ladyship to become suddenly possessed of a whim and to follow its lead on the spur of the moment she was a woman of caprices and her caprices always ruled the day as this one did to theos great astonishment
it seemed such a great undertaking to theodora this voyage of a few hours but lady throckmorton regarded it as the lightest of matters to her it was only the giving of a few orders being uncomfortably sea sick for a while and then landing in calais
so when theo broke into exclamations of pleasure and astonishment she did not understand either her enthusiasm or her surprise what she said you like the idea do you
well i think i have made up my mind about it we could go next week and i dare say we could reach vienna before denis oglethorpe goes away theo became suddenly silent she gave vent to no further exclamations she would almost have been willing to give up the pleasure of the journey after that
she was learning that it was best for her not to see denis oglethorpe again and here it seemed that she must see him in spite of herself even though she was conscientious enough to wish to do what was best not so much because it was best for herself as because it was just to priscilla gower
she was actually girlish and sensitive enough to fancy that mister denis oglethorpe might imagine their intention to follow him was some fault of hers and she was uncomfortable and nervous accordingly she hoped he would have left vienna before the letter reached him she hoped he might go away in spite of it
she hoped it might never reach him at all and yet in spite of this she experienced an almost passionately keen sense of disappointment when on the day before their departure lady throckmorton received a letter from him regretting his inability to comply with her request
and announcing his immediate departure for some place whose name he did not mention business had called him away and lady throckmorton of course knew what such business was and how imperative its demands were he might have waited theo said to herself
with an unexpected inconsistent feeling of wretchedness i would have stayed anywhere to have seen him only for a minute he had no need to be so ready to go away
i was burning with impatience to impart my news to him and this fact together with the ghostly proceedings of polton worked me up to a state of nervous tension that rendered either rest or thought equally impossible i looked out of the window at the lamp below glaring redly through the fog
at this moment polton made a silent appearance on the stairs leading from the laboratory giving me quite a start and i was about to retire into the room when my ear caught the tinkle of a hansom approaching from paper buildings
the vehicle drew nearer and at length stopped opposite the house on which polton slid down the stairs with the agility of a harlequin a few moments later i heard his voice ascending from the hall i do hope sir youre not much hurt
though very disreputable to look at just came a cropper in the mud jervis he added as he noted my dismayed expression dinner and a clothes brush are what i chiefly need nevertheless he looked very pale and shaken when he came into the light on the landing
and he sank into his easy chair in the limp manner of a man either very weak or very fatigued how did it happen i asked when polton had crept away on tip toe to make ready for dinner thorndyke looked round to make sure that his henchman had departed and said
a queer affair jervis a very odd affair indeed i was coming up from the borough picking my way mighty carefully across the road on account of the greasy slippery mud and had just reached the foot of london bridge when i heard a heavy lorry coming down the slope a good deal too fast
the horses came stamping and sliding straight on to me and before i could wriggle out of the way the hoof of one of them smashed in my hat that was a new one that i came home in and half stunned me then the near wheel struck my head making a dirty little scalp wound and pinned down my sleeve so that i couldnt pull away my arm
yes i went into dry dock in the o p room and then old langdale insisted on my lying down for an hour or so in case any symptoms of concussion should appear but i was only a trifle shaken and confused still it was a queer affair you mean the man pushing you down in that way
you dont think it was intentional surely i said no of course not he replied but without much conviction as it seemed to me and i was about to pursue the matter when polton reappeared and my friend abruptly changed the subject after dinner i recounted my conversation with walter hornby
watching my colleagues face with some eagerness to see what effect this new information would produce on him the result was on the whole disappointing he was interested keenly interested but showed no symptoms of excitement
so john hornby has been plunging in mines eh he said when i had finished he ought to know better at his age did you learn how long he had been in difficulties no but it can hardly have been quite sudden and unforeseen i should think not thorndyke agreed
in which case the depreciation would not have affected him in the same way it would be interesting to know for certain it might have a considerable bearing on the present case might it not undoubtedly said thorndyke it might bear on the case in more ways than one
that is well considered said my colleague but what is the special bearing on the case supposing it was so on the supposition i replied that mister hornby was in actual pecuniary difficulties at the date of the robbery it seems to me possible to construct a hypothesis
in fact it is almost fantastic never mind that said he a sound thinker gives equal consideration to the probable and the improbable thus encouraged i proceeded to set forth the theory of the crime as it had occurred to me on my way home in the fog
and i was gratified to observe the close attention with which thorndyke listened and his little nods of approval at each point that i made when i had finished he remained silent for some time looking thoughtfully into the fire and evidently considering how my theory and the new facts on which it was based
really adds to the achievement for the dullest mind can perceive the obvious as for instance the importance of a finger print you have really done a great thing and i congratulate you for you have emancipated yourself at least to some extent
from the great finger print obsession which has possessed the legal mind ever since galton published his epoch making monograph in that work i remember he states that a finger print affords evidence requiring no corroboration a most dangerous and misleading statement
which has been fastened upon eagerly by the police who have naturally been delighted at obtaining a sort of magic touchstone by which they are saved the labour of investigation but there is no such thing as a single fact that affords evidence requiring no corroboration
as well might one expect to make a syllogism with a single premise i suppose they would hardly go so far as that i said laughing no he admitted but the kind of syllogism that they do make is this the crime was committed by the person who made this finger print
was the crime committed by the person who made this finger print that is where the corroboration is required that practically leaves the case to be investigated without reference to the finger print which thus becomes of no importance not at all rejoined thorndyke
the finger print is a most valuable clue as long as its evidential value is not exaggerated take our present case for instance without the thumb print the robbery might have been committed by anybody there is no clue whatever
quite replied thorndyke i have entertained it from the first and the new facts that you have gathered increase its probability you remember i said that four hypotheses were possible that the robbery was committed either by reuben by walter by john hornby or by some other person
now putting aside the some other person for consideration only if the first three hypotheses fail we have left reuben walter and john but if we leave the thumb print out of the question the probabilities evidently point to john hornby
since he admittedly had access to the diamonds whereas there is nothing to show that the others had the thumb print however transfers the suspicion to reuben but yet as your theory makes evident it does not completely clear john hornby
as the case stands the balance of probabilities may be stated thus john hornby undoubtedly had access to the diamonds and therefore might have stolen them but if the thumb mark was made after he closed the safe and before he opened it again
but there is no evidence that he had access to them and if he had not he could not have made the thumb mark in the manner and at the time stated but john hornby may have had access to the previously made thumb mark of reuben and may possibly have obtained it in which case he is almost certainly the thief
as to walter hornby he may have had the means of obtaining reubens thumb mark but there is no evidence that he had access either to the diamonds or to mister hornbys memorandum block
the actual points at issue then i said are whether reuben had any means of opening the safe and whether mister hornby ever did actually have the opportunity of obtaining reubens thumb mark in blood on his memorandum block
yes replied thorndyke those are the points with some others and they are likely to remain unsettled reubens rooms have been searched by the police who failed to find any skeleton or duplicate keys but this proves nothing as he would probably have made away with them when he heard of the thumb mark being found
and shiny top boots his long legs enabled him to outstrip the others and in an almost breathless voice he begged uncle john to choose his carriage the besta carrozza ina town we dont want to ride was the answer the cabman implored
certainly they must make the amalfi drive
or at least il deserto the others stood by to listen silently to the discussion yielding first place to the victor in the race uncle john was obdurate all we want to day is to see the town he declared were not going to ride but walk
ah but the amalfi road signore surely you will see that
to morrow signore it is good at what hour to morrow illustrissimo oh dont bother me we may as well drive to amalfi to morrow suggested beth it is the proper thing to do uncle all right well go then you take my carrozza signore
let us see it instantly the crowd scampered back to the square followed more leisurely by uncle john and the girls there the uniformed vetturio stood beside the one modern carriage in the group it was new it was glossy
it had beautiful carefully brushed cushions it was drawn by a pair of splendid looking horses is not bellissima signore asked the man proudly
be ready to start at nine oclock to morrow morning the man promised whereat his confreres lost all interest in the matter and the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption they found out all about the amalfi drive that evening and were glad indeed they had decided to go
they had an early breakfast and were ready at nine oclock but when they came to the gate of the garden they found only a dilapidated carriage standing before it do you know where my rig is
i must not ruin a nice dress when i work answered the man smiling unabashed but the carriage what has become of the fine carriage and the good horses sir ah it is dreadful it is horrible signore
it do not remain good for a long ride so i leave him home for i am kind i do not wish the signorini bella to tire and weep but see the fine vetture you now have is he not easy like feathers an strong
it may be a bird but it dont look it said uncle john doubtfully
hop in my dears they entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and comfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent the driver mounted the box cracked his whip and the lean nags ambled away at a fair pace
it was standing just as it had before and beside it was another man dressed in the splendid uniform his driver had claimed that he had left at home
weve been swindled my dears he said swindled most beautifully but i suppose we may as well make the best of it better agreed patsy
this rig is all right uncle it may not be as pretty as the other but i expect that one is only kept to make engagements with when it comes to actual use we dont get it thats true enough he returned
indeed the sun did come out but only to give a discouraged look at the landscape and retire again
they had sunshine rain hail snow and a tornado and then rain again and more sunshine sunny italy seemed a misnomer that day as indeed it does many days in winter and spring
when the climate is little better than that prevailing in the eastern and central portions of the united states and perhaps one suffers more in italy than in america owing to the general lack of means to keep warm on cold days the italian
for he will permit no reproach to lie on his beloved land but the traveller frequently becomes discouraged and the american contingent especially
exaggerated the conditions by apostrophizing the country as sunny italy and for more than a century uttered such rhapsodies in its praise that the whole world credited them until it acquired personal experience of the matter
italy is beautiful it is charming and delightful but seldom is this true in winter or early spring the horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing they passed through the picturesque lanes of sorrento climbed
the further slope and brought the carriage to the other side of the peninsula where the girls obtained their first view of the gulf of salerno with the lovely isles of the sirens lying just beneath them
and has no duplicate in all the known world
rising straight from the sea which the highway overhangs at an average height of five hundred feet the traveller being protected only by a low stone parapet from the vast gulf that yawns beneath
and on the other side of the road the cliffs continue to ascend a like distance toward the sky
pilgrims when it rained they put up the carriage top which afforded but partial shelter
from that distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere toys then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge or plunge through an arch dividing the solid mountain
when the great adventure of the day overtook them without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great gale which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses reeling against the low parapet
and pushed upon the carriage as if determined to dash it over the precipice as it collided against the stone wall the vehicle tipped dangerously hurling the driver from his seat to dive headforemost into the space beneath
at this critical moment a mounted horseman who unobserved had been following the party dashed to their rescue the rider caught the plunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror at his own eminent peril
while the carriage lay wedged against the wall and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway between sea and sky
weight just above was a slight ledge he could reach it now and then she had him by the arm so that another instant found him clinging to the parapet and drawing himself into a position of safety
the horses as soon as the strain upon their bits was relaxed were easily quieted
the adventure was accomplished the peril was past and all was well again uncle john leaped from the carriage followed by louise and patsy
so opportunely was none other than count ferralti
he was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at beth
by every saint in the calendar that the girl had saved him from a frightful death and he would devote his future life to her service it is wonderful murmured ferralti
she kept her wits while the rest of us were scared to death uncle john had been observing the count one of the young mans hands hung limp and helpless are you hurt sir he asked ferralti smiled and his eyes rested upon louise
wed better get back to sorrento said uncle john abruptly
that is if you permit me to accompany you
as if they had never known a moments fear in their lives so the girls and their uncle climbed into the vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with his usual vigor
the wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed through positano which is four hundred feet high
count ferralti rode at the side of the carriage but did not attempt much conversation
now a hotel much favored by the tourist count ferralti promised to join them later and rode on to the town to find a surgeon to look after his injured hand while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a zigzag fashion up to the old monastery
which was founded in the year twelve twelve from the arbored veranda of this charming retreat is obtained one of the finest views in europe and while the girls sat enjoying it uncle john arranged with a pleasant faced woman
who had once lived in america for their luncheon an hour later and just as they were sitting down to the meal count ferralti rejoined them
in spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon but merely sipped a glass of wine so uncle john alarmed at his pallor insisted that he take a seat in the carriage on the return journey
and beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver
chapter twenty three patsy adopts an uncle uncle john and mister watson did not appear at dinner being closeted in the formers room
being served by the old servants as a mere matter of routine indeed the arrangements of the household had been considerably changed by the death of its mistress and without any real head to direct them the servants were patiently awaiting the advent of a new master or mistress
but there were few tears shed for jane merrick and the new regime could not fail to be an improvement over the last
but being unaware of its import gave it but passing attention the main subject of conversation was aunt janes surprising act in annulling her last will and forcing patricia to accept the inheritance when she did not want it
when alone with the three cousins protested that it would not be right for patsy to give him all the estate but as she was so generous he would accept enough of his uncle toms money to educate him as an artist and provide for himself an humble home
louise and beth having at last full knowledge of their cousins desire to increase their bequests were openly very grateful for her good will although secretly they could not fail to resent patsys choice of the boy as the proper heir of his uncles fortune
the balance of power seemed to be in patricias hands however
to offend her altogether they were all better provided for than they had feared would be the case so the little party spent a pleasant evening and separated early beth and louise to go to their rooms and canvass quietly the events of the day
and then she went to bed and slept peacefully
lawyer watson and uncle john were there looking as grave as the important occasion demanded
and the subsequent finding of the will
was made subsequent to the one under which jane merrick inherited and therefore supercedes it
of the estate during her lifetime
mister bradley having provided for that most fully for this reason the will i read to you yesterday is of no effect and kenneth forbes inherits from his uncle through his mother all of the estate blank looks followed mister watsons statement
good by to my five thousand said uncle john with his chuckling laugh but im much obliged to jane nevertheless dont we get anything at all asked beth with quivering lip no my dear answered the lawyer gently your aunt owned nothing to give you
patsy laughed she felt wonderfully relieved wasnt i the grand lady though with all the fortune i never had she cried merrily but twas really fine to be rich for a day and toss the money around as if i didnt have to dress ten heads of hair in ten hours to earn my bread and butter
louise smiled it was all a great farce she said i shall take the afternoon train to the city what an old fraud our dear aunt jane was and how foolish of me to return her hundred dollar check i used mine said beth bitterly
its all ill ever get it seems and then the thought of the professor and his debts overcame her and she burst into tears the boy sat doubled within his chair so overcome by the extraordinary fortune that had overtaken him that he could not speak
nor think even clearly as yet patsy tried to comfort beth never mind dear said she were no worse off than before we came are we and weve had a nice vacation
im going home today said beth angrily drying her eyes well all go home said patsy cheerfully for my part remarked uncle john in a grave voice i have no home
im wondering that myself said the little man meekly
no replied uncle john the merricks are out of elmhurst now and it returns to its rightful owners you owe me nothing my lad
louise smiled rather scornfully and beth scowled my mother and i live so simply in our little flat said one that we really havent extra room to keep a cat but we shall be glad to assist uncle john as far as we are able
father can hardly support his own family said the other but i will talk to my mother about uncle john when i get home and see what she says oh you dont need to indeed cried patsy in great indignation uncle john is my dear mothers brother and hes to come and live with the major and me as long as he cares to
no no say nothing at all sir come you shall if i have to drag you and if you act naughty ill send for the major to punish you
thank you my dear said he but wheres the money to come from money bah she said doesnt the major earn a heap with his bookkeeping and havent i had a raise lately why well be as snug and contented as pigs in clover can you get ready to come with me today uncle john
and he said he hoped to see all the girls again
the lawyer who had consented to stay at the mansion for a time
that may be answered the boy
chapter twenty four home again the major was at the station to meet them
the girl caught sight of him outside the gates his face red and beaming as a poppy in bloom and his snowy moustache bristling with eagerness at once she dropped her bundles and flew to the majors arms
leaving the little man in her wake to rescue her belongings and follow after he could hardly see patsy at all the major wrapped her in such an ample embrace but bye and bye she escaped to get her breath and then her eyes fell upon the meek form holding her bundles
on which account said the major grasping the little mans hand most cordially ill love uncle john like my own brother and surely he added his voice falling tenderly my dear violets brother must be my own
welcome sir now and always to our little home its modest sir but wherever patsy is the sun is sure to shine i can believe that said uncle john with a nod and smile
and the old fellow rattled away with the eagerness of a boy telling every detail in the most whimsical manner and finding something humorous in every incident oh but it was grand patsy he exclaimed and the colonel wept on my neck when we parted and stained the collar of me best coat
his face grew grave but how about the money patsy dear he asked did you get nothing out of jane merricks estate not a nickle dad twas the best joke you ever knew
i fought with aunt jane like a pirate and it quite won her heart when she died she left me all she had in the world look at that now said the major wonderingly which turned out to be nothing at all continued patsy
for another will was found made by mister thomas bradley which gave the money to his own nephew after aunt jane died did you ever wonderful said the major with a sigh so i was rich for half a day and then poor as ever it didnt hurt you did it
not at all daddy then dont mind it child like as not the money would be the ruination of us all eh sir appealing to uncle john
in your case it wont matter our house is yours and theres plenty and to spare thank you said uncle john his face grave but his eyes merry oh major cried patsy suddenly
theres danny reevess restaurant lets get off and have our dinner now im as hungry as a bear so they stopped the car and descended lugging all the parcels into the little restaurant where they were piled into a chair while the proprietor and the waiters all gathered around patsy to welcome her home
my how her eyes sparkled she fairly danced for joy and ordered the dinner with reckless disregard of the bill ah but its good to be back said the little bohemian gleefully the big house at elmhurst was grand and stately major but there wasnt an ounce of love in the cupboard
danny reeves himself came instead and made a nice little speech saying that patsy had always brought good luck to the place and this dinner was his treat to welcome her home so the major thanked him with gracious dignity and patsy kissed danny on his right cheek
its no palace said patsy entering to throw down the bundles as soon as the major unlocked the door but theres a cricket in the hearth and its your home uncle john as well as ours uncle john looked around curiously
the place was so plain after the comparative luxury of elmhurst and especially of the rose chamber patsy had occupied that the old man could not fail to marvel at the girls ecstatic joy to find herself in the old tenement again
there was one good sized living room with an ancient rag carpet partially covering the floor a sheet iron stove a sofa a table and three or four old fashioned chairs that had probably come from a second hand dealer
opening from this were two closet like rooms containing each a bed and a chair with a wash basin on a bracket shelf on the wails were a few colored prints from the sunday newspapers and one large and fine photograph of a grizzled old soldier
that uncle john at once decided must represent the colonel having noted these details patsys uncle smoothed back his stubby gray hair with a reflective and half puzzled gesture its cozy enough my child and i thank you for my welcome said he
but may i enquire where on earth you expect to stow me in this rather limited establishment where have you no eyes then she asked in astonishment its the finest sofa in the world uncle john and youll sleep there like a top
where indeed ah i see said uncle john and you can wash in my chamber added the major with a grand air and hang your clothes on the spare hooks behind my door i havent many said uncle john looking thoughtfully at his red bundle
the major coughed and turned the lamp a little higher youll find the air fine and the neighborhood respectable he said to turn the subject our modest apartments are cool in summer and warm in winter and remarkably reasonable in price
may i smoke of course but dont spoil the lace curtains dear answered patsy mischievously
but just to keep him out of mischief and busy he cant hang around all day and be happy i suppose ill look around answered the major briskly as if such a job was the easiest thing in the world to procure and meantime
meantime said uncle john smiling at them ill look around myself to be sure agreed the major between the two of us and patsy we ought to have no trouble at all there was a moment of thoughtful silence after this and then patsy said
by the bye added the major if you have any money about you which is just possible sir of course youd better turn it over to patsy to keep and let her make you an allowance thats the way i do its very satisfactory the majors extravagant exclaimed patsy
and if he has money he wants to treat every man he meets uncle john shook his head reproachfully at the major a very bad habit sir he said
but patsy is fast curing me and after all its a wicked city to be carrying a fat pocketbook around in as ive often observed my pocketbook is not exactly fat remarked uncle john but youve money sir for i marked you squandering it on the train said patsy severely
uncle john laughed and drew his chair up to the table then he emptied his trousers pockets upon the cloth and patsy gravely separated the keys and jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money seven dollars and forty two cents she announced any more
uncle john hesitated a moment and then drew from an inner pocket of his coat a thin wallet from this when she had received it from his hand the girl
good gracious she cried delightedly all this wealth and you pleading poverty i never said i was a pauper returned uncle john complacently you couldnt and be truthful sir declared the girl why this will last for ages
he smokes observed the major significantly bah a pipe said patsy and bull durham is only five cents a bag and a bag ought to last a week and every saturday night sir
thank you patsy said uncle john meekly and gathered up his forty two cents youve now a home and a manager sir with money in the bank of patsy and company limited
you ought to be very contented sir
chapter twenty five uncle john acts queerly
to pass the time he turned into a small restaurant and had coffee and a plate of cakes in spite of the fact that patsy had so recently prepared coffee over the sheet iron stove and brought some hot buns from a near by bakery he was not especially hungry but in sipping the coffee and nibbling the cakes
he passed the best part of an hour he smiled when he paid out twenty five cents of his slender store for the refreshment with five cents for car fare he had now but twelve cents left of the forty two patsy had given him
another hour was spent in looking in at the shop windows then suddenly noting the time uncle john started down the street at a swinging pace and presently paused before a building upon which was a sign reading isham
uncle john walked in although the uniformed official at the door eyed him suspiciously mister marvin in he inquired pleasantly not arrived yet said the official who wore a big star upon his breast ill wait announced uncle john and sat down upon a leather covered bench
another hour passed presently uncle john jumped up and approached the official hasnt mister marvin arrived yet he enquired sharply an hour ago was the reply then why didnt you let me know i want to see him
hes busy mornings has to look over the mail he cant see you yet well he will see me and right away tell him john merrick is here your card sir i havent any my name will do
the official hesitated and glanced at the little mans seedy garb and countryfied air but something in the angry glance of the shrewd eye made him fear he had made a mistake he opened a small door and disappeared
in a moment the door burst open to allow egress to a big red bearded man in his shirtsleeves who glanced around briefly and then rushed at uncle john and shook both his hands cordially
a great surprise and pleasure sir thomas im engaged this last was directed at the head of the amazed porter who as the door slammed in his face nodded solemnly and remarked
uncle john had been advised by patsy where to go for a good cheap luncheon but he did not heed her admonition instead he rode in a carriage beside the banker to a splendid club where he was served with the finest dishes the chef could provide on short notice
moreover mister marvin introduced him to several substantial gentlemen as mister john merrick of portland and each one bowed profoundly and declared he was highly honored yet uncle john seemed in no way elated by this reception
he talked with easy familiarity of preferred stocks and amalgamated interests and invested securities and many other queer things that the banker seemed to understand fully and to listen to with respectful deference
but he didnt go away quietly you may be sure mister marvin and mister isham both escorted their famous client to the door
in a moment the great broadway crowd had swallowed up john merrick and five minutes later he was thoughtfully gazing into a shop window again by and bye he bethought himself of the time and took a cab uptown
besides the check book which was carefully hidden away in an inside pocket so the cost of the cab did not worry him
danny reevess restaurant a block away patsy was standing in the doorway anxiously watching for him oh uncle john she cried as he strolled ive been really worried about you its such a big city and you a stranger
im sorry he said humbly but its a long way here from downtown didnt you take a car no my dear why you foolish old uncle come in at once
the major has been terribly excited over you and swore you should not be allowed to wander through the streets without someone to look after you but what could we do im all right declared uncle john cordially shaking hands with patsys father have you had a good day fine said the major
theyd missed me at the office and were glad to have me back
ive got a raise really said uncle john seeing it was expected of him for a fact its patsys doing ive no doubt she wheedled the firm into giving me a vacation and now theyre to pay me twelve a week instead of ten is that enough asked uncle john doubtfully
more than enough sir im getting old and cant earn as much as a younger man but im pretty tough and mean to hold onto that twelve a week as long as possible what pay do you get patsy asked uncle john almost as much as daddy
were dreadfully rich uncle john so you neednt worry if you dont strike a job yourself all at once any luck today sir asked the major tucking a napkin under his chin and beginning on the soup uncle john shook his head of course not said patsy quickly its too early as yet
dont hurry uncle john except that itll keep you busy theres no need for you to work at all youre older than i am suggested the major and that makes it harder to break in but theres no hurry as patsy says uncle john did not seem to be worrying over his idleness
and issued a string of orders in a voice not nearly so meek and mild as it was when he was in patsys presence
exceedingly you must be nearly bankrupt by this time said patsy on tuesday evening its an expensive city to live in sighed uncle john
your expenses are nothing at all declared the major with a wave of his hand but my dinners at danny reeves place must cost a lot protested uncle john
and we sleep till eight oclock dont we patsy asked the major of course and the eggs for breakfast ive bought them already three for a nickle you dont care for more than one do you uncle john no my dear
diana is invited to tea with tragic results october was a beautiful month at green gables
when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths
anne reveled in the world of color about her oh marilla she exclaimed one saturday morning coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs
it would be terrible if we just skipped from september to november wouldnt it look at these maple branches dont they give you a thrill several thrills im going to decorate my room with them messy things said marilla whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed
you clutter up your room entirely too much with out of doors stuff anne bedrooms were made to sleep in oh and dream in too marilla and you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things
im going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table mind you dont drop leaves all over the stairs then im going on a meeting of the aid society at carmody this afternoon anne and i wont likely be home before dark
it was dreadful of me to forget said anne apologetically but that was the afternoon i was trying to think of a name for violet vale
so he didnt find the time long at all it was a beautiful fairy story marilla i forgot the end of it so i made up an end for it myself and matthew said he couldnt tell where the join came in matthew would think it all right anne if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night
but you keep your wits about you this time and i dont really know if im doing right it may make you more addlepated than ever but you can ask diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here oh marilla anne clasped her hands
how perfectly lovely you are able to imagine things after all or else youd never have understood how ive longed for that very thing it will seem so nice and grown uppish no fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when i have company oh marilla
can i use the rosebud spray tea set no indeed the rosebud tea set well what next you know i never use that except for the minister or the aids
youll put down the old brown tea set but you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves its time it was being used anyhow i believe its beginning to work and you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps
i can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea said anne shutting her eyes ecstatically and asking diana if she takes sugar i know she doesnt but of course ill ask her just as if i didnt know
and then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves oh marilla its a wonderful sensation just to think of it can i take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes and then into the parlor to sit no
the sitting room will do for you and your company but theres a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night its on the second shelf of the sitting room closet and you and diana can have it if you like
anne flew down to the hollow past the dryads bubble and up the spruce path to orchard slope to ask diana to tea as a result just after marilla had driven off to carmody diana came over dressed in her second best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea
at other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking but now she knocked primly at the front door and when anne dressed in her second best as primly opened it both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before
how is your mother inquired anne politely just as if she had not seen missus barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits she is very well thank you
yes our potato crop is very good this year i hope your fathers crop is good too it is fairly good thank you have you picked many of your apples yet oh ever so many said anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly
lets go out to the orchard and get some of the red sweetings diana marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree marilla is a very generous woman she said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea
they taste twice as good as any other color the orchard with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it
diana had much to tell anne of what went on in school she had to sit with gertie pye and she hated it
ruby gillis had charmed all her warts away trues you live with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the creek gave her
charlie sloanes name was written up with em whites on the porch wall and em white was awful mad about it sam boulter had sassed mister phillips in class and mister phillips whipped him and sams father came down to the school and dared mister phillips to lay a hand on one of his children again
and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening and lizzie wright didnt speak to mamie wilson because mamie wilsons grown up sister had cut out lizzie wrights grown up sister with her beau
and everybody missed anne so and wished shes come to school again and gilbert blythe but anne didnt want to hear about gilbert blythe
anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there search revealed it away back on the top shelf anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler
now please help yourself diana she said politely i dont believe ill have any just now i dont feel as if i wanted any after all those apples
diana poured herself out a tumblerful looked at its bright red hue admiringly and then sipped it daintily thats awfully nice raspberry cordial anne she said i didnt know raspberry cordial was so nice
there are so many responsibilities on a persons mind when theyre keeping house isnt there
the tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice the nicest i ever drank said diana its ever so much nicer than missus lyndes although she brags of hers so much
it doesnt taste a bit like hers i should think marillas raspberry cordial would probly be much nicer than missus lyndes said anne loyally marilla is a famous cook
i was thinking the loveliest story about you and me diana i thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you but i went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life
and then i took the smallpox and died and i was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears
oh it was such a pathetic tale diana the tears just rained down over my cheeks while i mixed the cake but i forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure flour is so essential to cakes you know marilla was
very cross and i dont wonder im a great trial to her she was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week we had a plum pudding for dinner on tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over
marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it i meant to cover it just as much as could be diana but when i carried it in i was imagining i was a nun of course im a protestant but i imagined i was a catholic
taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion and i forgot all about covering the pudding sauce i thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry diana
fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce i lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then i washed the spoon in three waters
but when she did come in i was imagining that i was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow whichever they wanted to be so i never thought about the pudding sauce again and marilla sent me out to pick apples
you know they are very stylish people especially missus chester ross
i tried to be as polite and dignified as i could be for i wanted missus chester ross to think i was a ladylike little girl even if i wasnt pretty everything went right until i saw marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce warmed up in the other
diana that was a terrible moment i remembered everything and i just stood up in my place and shrieked out marilla you mustnt use that pudding sauce there was a mouse drowned in it i forgot to tell you before
oh diana i shall never forget that awful moment if i live to be a hundred missus chester ross just looked at me and i thought i would sink through the floor with mortification
she is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word then she just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves she even offered me some
but i couldnt swallow a mouthful it was like heaping coals of fire on my head after missus chester ross went away marilla gave me a dreadful scolding why diana what is the matter diana had stood up very unsteadily then she sat down again putting her hands to her head
im im awful sick she said a little thickly i i must go right home oh you mustnt dream of going home without your tea cried anne in distress ill get it right off ill go and put the tea down this very minute
i must go home repeated diana stupidly but determinedly let me get you a lunch anyhow implored anne let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves lie down on the sofa for a little while and youll be better where do you feel bad
i must go home said diana and that was all she would say in vain anne pleaded i never heard of company going home without tea she mourned oh diana do you suppose that its possible youre really taking the smallpox
if you are ill go and nurse you you can depend on that ill never forsake you but i do wish youd stay till after tea where do you feel bad im awful dizzy said diana and indeed she walked very dizzily
got dianas hat and went with her as far as the barry yard fence then she wept all the way back to green gables where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for matthew and jerry with all the zest gone out of the performance
and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk anne did not stir abroad from green gables monday afternoon marilla sent her down to missus lyndes on an errand in a very short space of time anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks
into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony whatever has gone wrong now anne queried marilla in doubt and dismay i do hope you havent gone and been saucy to missus lynde again
no answer from anne save more tears and stormier sobs anne shirley when i ask you a question i want to be answered sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about anne sat up tragedy personified
missus lynde was up to see missus barry today and missus barry was in an awful state she wailed she says that i set diana drunk saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition
and she says i must be a thoroughly bad wicked little girl and shes never never going to let diana play with me again oh marilla im just overcome with woe marilla stared in blank amazement set diana drunk
she said when she found her voice anne are you or missus barry crazy what on earth did you give her not a thing but raspberry cordial sobbed anne
not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as diana did oh it sounds so so like missus thomass husband but i didnt mean to set her drunk drunk fiddlesticks said marilla marching to the sitting room pantry
although certain of the stricter sort missus barry among them disapproved strongly of it and at the same time marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar
she went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand her face was twitching in spite of herself anne you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble you went and gave diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial
didnt you know the difference yourself i never tasted it said anne i thought it was the cordial i meant to be so so hospitable diana got awfully sick and had to go home missus barry told missus lynde she was simply dead drunk
she just laughed silly like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk she had a fearful headache all day yesterday missus barry is so indignant
she will never believe but what i did it on purpose i should think she would better punish diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything said marilla shortly why three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial
well this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine although i havent made any for three years ever since i found out that the minister didnt approve i just kept that bottle for sickness
there there child dont cry i cant see as you were to blame although im sorry it happened so i must cry said anne my heart is broken the stars in their courses fight against me marilla diana and i are parted forever oh marilla
missus barry will think better of it when she finds youre not to blame i suppose she thinks youve done it for a silly joke or something of that sort youd best go up this evening and tell her how it was
my courage fails me at the thought of facing dianas injured mother sighed anne i wish youd go marilla youre so much more dignified than i am likely shed listen to you quicker than to me well i will
said marilla reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course dont cry any more anne it will be all right marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from orchard slope anne was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her
oh marilla i know by your face that its been no use she said sorrowfully missus barry wont forgive me missus barry indeed snapped marilla of all the unreasonable women i ever saw shes the worst
marilla whisked into the kitchen grievously disturbed leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her presently anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk
very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods
missus barry coming to the door in answer to a timid knock found a white lipped eager eyed suppliant on the doorstep her face hardened missus barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes and her anger was of the cold sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome
to do her justice she really believed anne had made diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child what do you want she said stiffly
anne clasped her hands oh missus barry please forgive me i did not mean to to intoxicate diana how could i just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted
and you had just one bosom friend in all the world do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose i thought it was only raspberry cordial i was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial oh please dont say that you wont let diana play with me any more
if you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe this speech which would have softened good missus lyndes heart in a twinkling had no effect on missus barry except to irritate her still more she was suspicious of annes big words and dramatic gestures
and imagined that the child was making fun of her so she said coldly and cruelly i dont think you are a fit little girl for diana to associate with youd better go home and behave yourself annes lips quivered
wont you let me see diana just once to say farewell she implored diana has gone over to carmody with her father said missus barry going in and shutting the door anne went back to green gables calm with despair
my last hope is gone she told marilla i went up and saw missus barry myself and she treated me very insultingly marilla i do not think she is a well bred woman there is nothing more to do except to pray
anne you shouldnt say such things rebuked marilla striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her and indeed when she told the whole story to matthew that night she did laugh heartily over annes tribulations
but when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face poor little soul she murmured
that old nuisance of a rachel lynde was here again today pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room said mister harrison wrathfully i detest that woman more than anybody i know she can put a whole sermon
text comment and application into six words and throw it at you like a brick anne who was perched on the edge of the veranda enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray november twilight
and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden turned her dreamy face over her shoulder the trouble is you and missus lynde dont understand one another she explained that is always what is wrong when people dont like each other
i didnt like missus lynde at first either but as soon as i came to understand her i learned to missus lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks
i said some dreadful things to missus lynde long ago but it was when i had lost my temper i couldnt say them deliberately it was the truth and i believe in telling the truth to everybody
you only tell the disagreeable part of the truth now youve told me a dozen times that my hair was red but youve never once told me that i had a nice nose
i know i have red hair too although its much darker than it used to be so theres no need of telling me that either well well ill try and not mention it again since youre so sensitive
you must excuse me anne ive got a habit of being outspoken and folks mustnt mind it but they cant help minding it and i dont think its any help that its your habit what would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying
excuse me you mustnt mind it its just a habit ive got youd think he was crazy wouldnt you and as for missus lynde being a busybody perhaps she is but did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor
and never said a word when timothy cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife hed bought it from her missus cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and missus lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly
folks are everlasting begging for money here it seems to me hows your project of painting the hall coming on splendidly we had a meeting of the a v i s last friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too
most people gave very liberally mister harrison anne was a sweet souled lass but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required what color are you going to have it we have decided on a very pretty green
mister roger pye is going to get the paint in town today whos got the job mister joshua pye of carmody he has nearly finished the shingling we had to give him the contract for every one of the pyes and there are four families you know
said they wouldnt give a cent unless joshua got it they had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose although some people think we shouldnt have given in to the pyes missus lynde says they try to run everything
the main question is will this joshua do his work well if he does i dont see that it matters whether his name is pye or pudding he has the reputation of being a good workman though they say hes a very peculiar man he hardly ever talks
hes peculiar enough all right then said mister harrison drily
i never was much of a talker till i came to avonlea and then i had to begin in self defense or missus lynde would have said i was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language
i must i have some sewing to do for dora this evening besides davy is probably breaking marillas heart with some new mischief by this time this morning the first thing he said was where does the dark go anne i want to know
the poor bird has been moping ever since those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks everything thats worth having is some trouble said anne secretly resolving to forgive davys next offence whatever it might be since he had avenged her on ginger
began painting the next day he was not disturbed in his task the hall was situated on what was called the lower road in late autumn this road was always muddy and wet and people going to carmody traveled by the longer upper road
the hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it mister joshua pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to carmody
the news flew like wildfire gilbert blythe poring over a text book at home heard it from his fathers hired boy at sunset and rushed breathlessly to green gables joined on the way by fred wright
arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for marilla havent you heard said jane wrathfully well its simply this joshua pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green a deep brilliant blue
the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows and missus lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building especially when combined with a red roof that she ever saw or imagined you could simply have knocked me down with a feather when i heard it
its heartbreaking after all the trouble weve had how on earth could such a mistake have happened wailed diana the blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the pyes the improvers had decided to use morton harris paints
and the morton harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card a purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number
and when mister roger pye sent word to the improvers by his son john andrew that he was going to town and would get their paint for them
and there the matter stands to this day that night there was blank dismay in every avonlea house where an improver lived the gloom at green gables was so intense that it quenched even davy anne wept and would not be comforted
and it sounds the death knell of our society well simply be laughed out of existence in life as in dreams however things often go by contraries the avonlea people did not laugh they were too angry
their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake public indignation centered on the pyes roger pye and john andrew had bungled the matter between them
and as for joshua pye he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint joshua pye when thus animadverted upon retorted that the avonlea taste in colors was no business of his
you cant hold him responsible for the mistake since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead but its a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful
the luckless improvers expected that avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them but instead public sympathy veered around in their favor
had been badly used missus lynde told them to keep on and show the pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them mister major spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense
to tell her that if the sassiety wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they neednt be afraid of her cow for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds even mister harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private
and was all sympathy outwardly never mind anne most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with so its bound to fade prettier and the roof is shingled and painted all right
folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on youve accomplished so much anyhow
teaching is really very interesting work wrote anne to a queens academy chum jane says she thinks it is monotonous but i dont find it so something funny is almost sure to happen every day and the children say such amusing things
it was because jimmy called him saint clair that saint clair pounded him on the way home from school i heard of the pounding but not officially so i dont think ill take any notice of it yesterday i was trying to teach lottie wright to do addition i said
because it would rain the next day its so hard not to laugh stella i have to save up all my amusement until i get home and marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause
did you know that thomas a becket was canonized as a snake rose bell says he was also that william tyndale wrote the new testament claude white says a glacier is a man who puts in window frames
hannah bell wanted to be good without having to take any trouble about it marjory white aged ten wanted to be a widow questioned why she gravely said that if you werent married people called you an old maid and if you were your husband bossed you
but if you were a widow thered be no danger of either the most remarkable wish was sally bells she wanted a honeymoon
because her cousin in montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles another day i asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done i couldnt get the older ones to do so but the third class answered quite freely
eliza bell had set fire to her aunts carded rolls asked if she meant to do it she said not altogether
i wish you could see some of their compositions so much do i wish it that ill send you copies of some written recently last week i told the fourth class i wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited
or some interesting thing or person they had seen they were to write the letters on real note paper seal them in an envelope and address them to me all without any assistance from other people last friday morning i found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening i realized afresh
p e island can birds dear teacher i think i will write you a composition about birds birds is very useful animals my cat catches birds his name is william but pa calls him tom
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter only for that he would be a good looking cat my unkle has adopted a cat it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children that is not right we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children
it is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination dear miss shirley you told us to describe something strange we have seen i will describe the avonlea hall it has two doors an inside one and an outside one
it has six windows and a chimney it has two ends and two sides it is painted blue that is what makes it strange it is built on the lower carmody road it is the third most important building in avonlea the others are the church and the blacksmith shop
and hers are generally as brief as saint clairs annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior but there isnt a shadow of orginality in her here is her letter dearest teacher i think i will write you a letter to tell you how much i love you
i love you with my whole heart and soul and mind with all there is of me to love and i want to serve you for ever it would be my highest privilege that is why i try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns you are so beautiful my teacher
when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it i will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me besides its the year we moved to avonlea from newbridge my love for you has made my life very rich
i owe this all to you my sweetest teacher i shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time i saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair i shall see you like that for ever even when we are both old and gray you will always be young and fair to me dearest teacher
i kiss your hands and face my sweet may god watch over you and protect you from all harm your afecksionate pupil annetta bell this extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little
and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter annetta cried and fessed up freely she said she had never written a letter and she didnt know how to or what to say
i put teacher where he put lady and i put in something of my own when i could think of it and i changed some words i put dress in place of mood
here is barbara shaws letter i cant reproduce the blots of the original dear teacher you said we might write about a visit i never visited but once it was at my aunt marys last winter
my aunt mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper the first night i was there we were at tea i knocked over a jug and broke it aunt mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before
when we got up i stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt the next morning when i got up i hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and i upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast
when i was helping aunt mary with the dinner dishes i dropped a china plate and it smashed that evening i fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week i heard aunt mary tell uncle joseph it was a mercy or id have broken everything in the house
when i got better it was time to go home i dont like visiting very much i like going to school better especially since i came to avonlea yours respectfully barbara shaw willie whites began respected miss
i want to tell you about my very brave aunt she lives in ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard the dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion
but she was very brave emerson gillis says if she thought it was a dog she wasnt any braver than if it really was a dog but emerson is jealous because he hasnt got a brave aunt himself nothing but uncles i have kept the best for the last
you laugh at me because i think paul is a genius but i am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates no real playmates
but i cant help loving paul irving the best of all mine i dont think it does any harm though for everybody loves paul even missus lynde who says she could never have believed shed get so fond of a yankee the other boys in school like him too
there is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies he is very manly and can hold his own in all games he fought saint clair donnell recently because saint clair said the union jack was away ahead of the stars and stripes as a flag
saint clair says he can hit the hardest but paul can hit the oftenest pauls letter my dear teacher you told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew i think the most interesting people i know are my rock people
and i mean to tell you about them i have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but i would like to have you know about them because you understand things there are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them
nora was the first one of them i got acquainted with and so i think i love her the best she lives in andrews cove and she has black hair and black eyes and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies you ought to hear the stories she can tell
then there are the twin sailors they dont live anywhere they sail all the time but they often come ashore to talk to me they are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world and more than what is in the world
a moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea you know teacher well the youngest twin sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon
he had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them then there is the golden lady of the cave one day i found a big cave down on the shore and i went away in and after a while i found the golden lady
she has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive and she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully
but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks ive never told nora about the golden lady i was afraid it might hurt her feelings it even hurt her feelings if i talked too long with the twin sailors i always met the twin sailors at the striped rocks
because id promised grandmother id never associate with anybody that swore he was pretty well scared i can tell you and he said if i would forgive him he would take me to the sunset so the next evening when i was sitting on the striped rocks
the oldest twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and i got in her the boat was all pearly and rainbowy like the inside of the mussel shells and her sail was like moonshine well we sailed right across to the sunset
but the oldest twin says it was only a few minutes you see in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here your loving pupil paul irving
a jonah day it really began the night before with a restless wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache when anne arose in the dull bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat stale and unprofitable
she went to school in no angelic mood her cheek was swollen and her face ached the schoolroom was cold and smoky for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups
anthony pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat mate and then glance at her with a grin never so it seemed to anne had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning
and when barbara shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results the coal rolled to every part of the room her slate was broken into fragments and when she picked herself up her face stained with coal dust sent the boys into roars of laughter
anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing really barbara she said icily if you cannot move without falling over something youd better remain in your seat it is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward
please miss i had to help ma make a pudding for dinner cause were expecting company and clarice almiras sick was saint clairs answer given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates
take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty four of your arithmetic for punishment said anne saint clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate then he stealthily passed a small parcel to joe sloane across the aisle
anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel old missus hiram sloane had lately taken to making and selling nut cakes by way of adding to her scanty income the cakes were specially tempting to small boys
anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated and yet here was saint clair donnell coolly passing a parcel of them wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper missus hiram used under her very eyes
really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which warren sloane had sent to town by saint clair donnells father the day before intending to have a birthday celebration that evening
joe sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and saint clair helpless with laughter rocked to and fro in the aisle prillie rogerson fainted and annetta bell went into hysterics
anne recovering herself sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room then she helped the girls carry the unconscious prillie into the porch
where barbara shaw in an agony of desire to be useful poured a pailful of half frozen water over prillies face and shoulders before anyone could stop her it was a full hour before quiet was restored
everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teachers mental atmosphere nobody except anthony pye dared whisper a word ned clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum caught annes eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up
chester sloane spelling odoriferous with two fs was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it either in this world or that which is to come
but the knowledge only angered her further
he peered across his book at anne his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer scampered over the desk and leaped to the floor
especially as she didnt know just where the mouse had gone but she decided not to who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a teacher so white faced and so blazing eyed standing before one who put that mouse in my desk said anne
her voice was quite low but it made a shiver go up and down paul irvings spine joe sloane caught her eye felt responsible from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet but stuttered out wildly
anne paid no attention to the wretched joseph she looked at anthony pye and anthony pye looked back unabashed and unashamed anthony was it you yes it was said anthony insolently
anne took her pointer from her desk it was a long heavy hardwood pointer come here anthony it was far from being the most severe punishment anthony pye had ever undergone anne
even the stormy souled anne she was at that moment could not have punished any child cruelly but the pointer nipped keenly and finally anthonys bravado failed him he winced and the tears came to his eyes anne conscience stricken dropped the pointer and told anthony to go to his seat
she sat down at her desk feeling ashamed repentant and bitterly mortified her quick anger was gone and she would have given much to have been able to seek relief in tears so all her boasts had come to this she had actually whipped one of her pupils
kept back her tears until she got home that night then she shut herself in the east gable room and wept all her shame and remorse and disappointment into her pillows wept so long that marilla grew alarmed invaded the room and insisted on knowing what the trouble was
the trouble is ive got things the matter with my conscience sobbed anne oh this has been such a jonah day marilla im so ashamed of myself i lost my temper and whipped anthony pye im glad to hear it said marilla with decision
its what you should have done long ago oh no no marilla and i dont see how i can ever look those children in the face again i feel that i have humiliated myself to the very dust you dont know how cross and hateful and horrid i was
oh marilla i have tried so hard to be patient and to win anthonys liking and now it has all gone for nothing marilla passed her hard work worn hand over the girls glossy tumbled hair with a wonderful tenderness
when annes sobs grew quieter she said very gently for her you take things too much to heart anne we all make mistakes but people forget them and jonah days come to everybody as for anthony pye why need you care if he does dislike you
he is the only one i cant help it i want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when anybody doesnt and anthony never will now oh i just made an idiot of myself today marilla ill tell you the whole story
just come downstairs and have your supper youll see if a good cup of tea and those plum puffs i made today wont hearten you up plum puffs wont minister to a mind diseased said anne disconsolately
it had snowed softly and thickly all through the hours of darkness and the beautiful whiteness glittering in the frosty sunshine looked like a mantle of charity cast over all the mistakes and humiliations of the past every morn is a fresh beginning
every morn is the world made new sang anne as she dressed owing to the snow she had to go around by the road to school and she thought it was certainly an impish coincidence that anthony pye should come ploughing along just as she left the green gables lane
anne surrendered her books and wondered if she could possibly be awake anthony walked on in silence to the school but when anne took her books she smiled down at him not the stereotyped kind smile she had so persistently assumed for his benefit
but a sudden outflashing of good comradeship anthony smiled no if the truth must be told anthony grinned back a grin is not generally supposed to be a respectful thing
missus rachel lynde came up the next saturday and confirmed this well anne i guess youve won over anthony pye thats what he says he believes you are some good after all even if you are a girl says that whipping you gave him was just as good as a mans
no but the pyes are an exception to every known rule thats what declared missus rachel with conviction
rather odd commented mister jenks black paper and white ink white ink is easy enough to make stated mister parker
i fancy they wanted it as conspicuous as possible yes agreed tom
together with the antics of the thing in white last night shows that they are aware of our presence here and perhaps know who we are we will have to be on our guard do you think that fellow munson
whom we left in the forest could have gotten here and warned them asked mister damon its possible admitted tom but now lets see if the person who pinned this warning on our tent took any of our things
a hasty examination however showed that nothing had been disturbed
everyone talking during the progress of the meal about the events of the day and the rather weird culmination of it well we havent had a great deal of success so far admitted tom
good idea commented mister jenks well do it and move our camp i only hope those fellows dont find our airship and destroy it well have a hard time getting back to civilization again
if we have to walk all the way this contingency caused tom some uneasiness he did not like to think that the unscrupulous men might damage the red cloud
that had been built only after hard labor but he knew he could accomplish nothing by worrying and he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind
they rather expected to see the thing in white again that night but it did not appear and morning came without anything having disturbed their heavy sleep for they were tired from the days tramp
it took them the greater part of the day to make a circuit of the base of phantom mountain in order to get to a place where a sort of trail led upward its too late to do anything to night
mister parker he asked as he saw the scientist tramping a little way up the side of the mountain i am going to make some observations was the answer and no one paid any more attention to him for some time
supper was nearly ready when mister parker returned his face wore a rather serious air and mister damon noting it asked laughingly well
did you discover any volcanoes that may erupt during the night and scare us to death no replied mister parker calmly but there is every indication that we will soon have a terrific electrical storm
from a high peak i caught a glimpse of one working this way across the mountains then wed better fasten the tent well down called tom we dont want it to blow away
was mister parkers opinion from what then asked mister jenks from the discharges of lightning among these mountain peaks which contain so much iron ore
we will be in grave danger the fact that the scientist had not always made correct predictions was not now considered by his hearers and tom and the two men gazed at mister parker in some alarm
as the iron ore extends for miles we can not get out of the danger zone before the storm will reach us it will be here in less than half an hour then wed better have supper remarked tom practically
and get ready for it perhaps it may not be as bad as mister parker fears it will be bad enough declared the gloomy scientist and he seemed to find pleasure in his announcement
for now low mutterings of thunder could be heard off toward the west black clouds rapidly obscured the heavens and the sound of thunder increased
fitful flashes of lightning could be seen forking across the sky in jagged chains of purple light its going to be a heavy storm tom admitted to himself
i hope lightning doesnt strike around here the storm came on rapidly but there was a curious quietness in the air that was more alarming than if a wind had blown the campfire burned steadily
and there was a certain oppressiveness in the atmosphere it was now quite dark save when the fitful lightning flashes came and they illuminated the scene brilliantly for a few seconds then by contrast
it was blacker than ever suddenly as tom was gazing up toward the peak of phantom mountain he saw something that caused him to cry out in alarm he pointed upward and whispered hoarsely
they must have followed us said mister jenks in a low voice slowly the figure advanced it waved the long white arms as if in warning
at times it would be only dimly visible in the blackness then suddenly it would stand out in bold relief as a great flash of fire split the clouds the thunder meanwhile
had been growing louder and sharper indicating the nearer approach of the storm each lightning flash was followed in a second or two by a terrific clap still there was no wind nor rain
and the campfire burned steadily all at once there was a crash as if the very mountain had split asunder and the adventurers saw a great ball of purple bluish fire shoot down
as if from some cloud and strike against the side of the crag not a hundred feet from where stood the ghostly figure in white that was a bad one cried mister damon
shouting so as to be heard above the echoes of the thunderclap almost as he spoke there came another explosion even louder than the one preceding a great ball of fire pear shaped
leaped for the same spot in the mountain theres a mass of iron ore there yelled mister parker the lightning is attracted to it his voice was swallowed up in the terrific crash that followed
the figure in white could be seen hurrying back up the mountain trail evidently the electrical storm with lightning bolts discharging so close was too much for the ghost
in another instant it looked as if the whole place about where the diamond seekers stood was a mass of fire great forked tongues of lightning leaped from the clouds and seemed to lick the ground
and there was a strong smell of sulphur in the air we are in the midst of the storm cried mister parker we are standing on a mass of iron ore any minute may be our last
but fate had not intended the adventurers for death by lightning almost as suddenly as it had begun the discharge of the tongues of fire ceased in the immediate vicinity of our friends
they stood still awed not knowing what to do then once more came a terrific clap a great mass of fire like some red hot ingot from a foundry
was hurled through the air straight at the face of the mountain and at the spot where the figure in white had stood but a few minutes before instantly the earth trembled as it had at earthquake island
but it was not the same it was over in a few seconds then as the diamond seekers looked they saw in the glare of a score of lightning flashes that followed the one great clap
she durham july something or other at farmer hendrys we left york this morning and arrived in durham about eleven oclock it seems there is some sort of an election going on in the town
and there was not a single fly at the station mister copley looked about in every direction but neither horse nor vehicle was to be had for love or money at last we started to walk to the village
mister copley so laden with our hand luggage that he resembled a pack mule we called first at the three tuns where they still keep up the old custom of giving a wee glass of cherry brandy to each guest on his arrival but alas
they were crowded and we were turned from the hospitable door we then made a tour of the inns but not a single room was to be had not for that night nor for two days ahead on account of that same election hadnt we better go on to edinburgh
i asked as we were resting in the door of the jolly sailor edinburgh never she replied
and write up a record of our entire trip from winchester while the impressions were fresh in my mind
said mister copley that is i hoped to finish off my previous sketches which are in a frightful state of incompletion and spend a good deal of time on the interior of this cathedral which is unusually beautiful
in her opinion the constant consumption of malt liquors prevents a more dangerous indulgence in brandy and whisky she is gathering statistics but as the barmaids can never collect their thoughts while they are drawing ale
for my part said i with mock humility i am a docile person who never has any intentions of her own but who yields herself sweetly to the intentions of other people in her immediate vicinity are you
asked mister copley taking out his pencil yes i said so what are you doing merely taking note of your statement thats all now miss van tyck
i have a plan to propose i was here last summer with a couple of harvard men and we lodged at a farmhouse about a mile distant from the cathedral if you will step into the coffee room for an hour
ill walk up to farmer hendrys and see if they will take us in i think we might be fairly comfortable can aunt celia have apollinaris and black coffee after her morning bath i asked i hope katharine
if mister copley can secure apartments for us i shall be more than grateful so here we are all lodging together in an ideal english farmhouse
and the butter and cream and eggs and mutton are delicious and i never never want to go home any more i want to live here for ever and wave the american flag on washingtons birthday
i am so happy that i feel as if something were going to spoil it all twenty years old to day i wish mamma were alive to wish me many happy returns the cathedral is very beautiful in itself
and its situation is beyond all words of mine to describe i greatly admired the pulpit which is supported by five pillars sunk into the backs of squashed lions but mister copley when i asked him the period said pure brummagem
not jenny wren christopher architecture has had in england especially no legitimate development this is the only cathedral with a bishops throne or a sanctuary knocker he
durham july nineteenth
how did it happen to be election time why did the inns chance to be full
i do not know i only know fate smiles that kitty and i eat our morning bacon and eggs together
and dine with kitty and walk in the gloaming with kitty
and after a day of heaven like this like lorna doones lover ay and like every other lover i suppose i go to sleep and the roof above me swarms with angels having kitty under it she was so beautiful on sunday
and when she looks up i am never ready for her to look down if it had been a secular occasion and she had dropped her handkerchief seven eighths of the students would have started to pick it up but i should have got there first well
for there are facts to be considered delightful warm breathing facts we were coming home from evensong kitty and i i am anticipating for she was still miss schuyler then but never mind
we were walking through the fields while missus benedict and aunt celia were driving as we came across a corner of the bit of meadow land that joins the stable and the garden we heard a muffled roar
and as we looked around we saw a creature with tossing horns and waving tail making for us head down eyes flashing kitty gave a shriek we chanced to be near a pair of low bars i hadnt been a college athlete for nothing
flung herself bodily into my arms crying jack jack save me it was the first time she had called me jack and i needed no second invitation i proceeded to save her in the usual way
by holding her to my heart and kissing her lovely hair reassuringly as i murmured you are safe my darling not a hair of your precious head shall be hurt dont be frightened she shivered like a leaf
i am frightened she said i cant help being frightened he will chase us i know where is he what is he doing now looking up to determine if i need abbreviate this blissful moment
comfortable durham cow that somewhat rare but possible thing a sportive cow is he gone breathed kitty from my waistcoat yes he is gone she is gone darling but dont move
it may come again my first too hasty assurance had calmed kittys fears
i did not facilitate the preparations and a moment of awkward silence ensued might i inquire i asked if the dear little person at present reposing in my arms will stay there with intervals for rest and refreshment
for the rest of her natural life she withdrew entirely now all but her hand and her eyes sought the ground i suppose i shall have to that is if you think at least i suppose you do think
she replied i was frightened within an inch of my life i told you this morning that i was dreadfully afraid of bulls especially mad ones and i told you that my nurse frightened me when i was a child with awful stories about them
and that i never outgrew my childish terror i looked everywhere about the barn was too far the fence too high i saw him coming and there was nothing but you and the open country of course i took you it was very natural im sure
she cried putting her hand over my lips and getting it well kissed in consequence
as we approached the inn at amherst the clockmaker grew uneasy its pretty well on in the evening i guess said he and marm pugwash is as onsartin in her temper as a mornin in april
its all sunshine or all clouds with her and if shes in one of her tantrums shell stretch out her neck and hiss like a goose with a flock of goslins
the old minister had an orchard of most particular good fruit for he was a great hand at buddin graftin and what not and the orchard it was on the south side of the house stretched right up to the road well
there were some trees hung over the fence i never seed such bearers the apples hung in ropes for all the world like strings of onions and the fruit was beautiful nobody touched the ministers apples
so i said to him one day minister said i how on airth do you manage to keep your fruit thats so exposed when no one else cant do it nohow why says he they are dreadfully pretty fruit aint they
that are outward row i grafted myself with the choicest kind i could find and i succeeded they are beautiful but so etarnal sour no human soul can eat them well
the boys think the old ministers graftin has all succeeded about as well as that row
if pugwash had a watery mouth when he married i guess its pretty puckery by this time however if she goes to act ugly
ill give her a dose of soft sawder that will take the frown out of her frontispiece and make her dial plate as smooth as a lick of copal varnish its a pity shes such a kickin devil too for she has good points good eye good foot
neat pastern fine chest a clean set of limbs and carries a good but here we are now youll see what soft sawder will do when we entered the house the travelers room was all in darkness
and on opening the opposite door into the sitting room we found the female part of the family extinguishing the fire for the night missus pugwash had a broom in her hand and was in the act the last act of female housewifery of sweeping the hearth
the strong flickering light of the fire as it fell upon her tall fine figure and beautiful face revealed a creature worthy of the clockmakers comments good evening marm said mister slick how do you do
and hows mister pugwash he said she why hes been abed this hour you dont expect to disturb him this time of night i hope oh no said mister slick certainly not
and i am sorry to have disturbed you but we got detained longer than we expected i am sorry that so am i said she but if mister pugwash will keep an inn when he has no occasion to his family cant expect no rest
here the clockmaker seeing the storm gathering stooped down suddenly and staring intently held out his hand and exclaimed well if that aint a beautiful child come here my little man
and shake hands along with me well i declare if that are little feller aint the finest child i ever seed what not abed yet ah you rogue
well i wish my old mother could see that child it is such a treat in our country said he turning to me the children are all as pale as chalk or as yaller as an orange lord
that are little feller would be a show in our country come to me my man here the soft sawder began to operate missus pugwash said in a milder tone than we had yet heard go my dear to the gentleman
go dear mister slick kissed him asked him if he would go to the states along with him told him all the little girls would fall in love with him for they didnt see such a beautiful face once in a month of sundays black eyes let me see
she ought to be proud of you he continued well if i live to return here i must paint your face and have it put on my clocks and our folks will buy the clocks for the sake of the face did you ever see said he
again addressing me such a likeness between one human and another as between this beautiful little boy and his mother i am sure you have had no supper said missus pugwash to me you must be hungry and weary too
i will get you a cup of tea i am sorry to give you so much trouble said i not the least trouble in the world she replied on the contrary a pleasure we were then shown into the next room
where the fire was now blazing up but mister slick protested he could not proceed without the little boy and lingered behind to ascertain his age and concluded by asking the child if he had any aunts that looked like mama
as the door closed mister slick said its a pity she dont go well in gear the difficulty with those critters is to git them to start arter that there is no trouble with them if you dont check em too short if you do theyll stop again
run back and kick like mad and then old nick himself wouldnt start em pugwash i guess dont understand the natur of the crittur shell never go kind in harness for him when i see a child said the clockmaker
i always feel safe with these women folk for i have always found that the road to a womans heart lies through her child you seem said i to understand the female heart so well i make no doubt you are a general favorite among the fair sex
any man he replied that understands horses has a pretty considerable fair knowledge of women for they are jist alike in temper and require the very identical same treatment encourage the timid ones
and i tell you there aint one in a thousand that knows a grain about either on em you hear folks say oh such a man is an ugly grained critter hell break his wifes heart jist as if a womans heart was as brittle as a pipe stalk
the female heart as far as my experience goes is jist like a new india rubber shoe you may pull and pull at it till it stretches out a yard long
their hearts are made of stout leather i tell you
i never knowed but one case of a broken heart and that was in tother sex one washington banks he was a sneezer he was tall enough to spit down on the heads of your grenadiers and near about high enough to wade across charlestown river
and as strong as a tow boat i guess he was somewhat less than a foot longer than the moral law and catechism too he was a perfect pictur of a man you couldnt fault him in no particular he was so just a made critter
when they all came out together an amazin handsom sight too near about a whole congregation of young gals banks used to say i vow young ladies i wish i had five hundred arms to reciprocate one with each of you
but i reckon i have a heart big enough for you all its a whopper you may depend and every mite and morsel of it at your service well how you do act mister banks half a thousand little clipper clapper tongues would say
all at the same time and their dear little eyes sparklin like so many stars twinklin of a frosty night well when i last seed him he was all skin and bone like a horse turned out to die he was teetotally defleshed
a mere walkin skeleton i am dreadful sorry says i to see you banks lookin so peaked why you look like a sick turkey hen all legs what on airth ails you im dyin says he
no says he shakin his head i hope i have too much clear grit in me to take on so bad for that what under the sun is it then said i why says he i made a bet
the fore part of the summer with leftenant oby knowles that i could shoulder the best bower of the constitution frigate i won my bet but the anchor was so etarnal heavy that it broke my heart
neither at dinner on that evening at manchester square nor after dinner as long as missus roby remained in the house was a word said about lopez by mister wharton he remained longer than usual with his bottle of port wine in the dining room
but as soon as missus roby was gone and missus roby went home round the corner somewhat earlier than usual then mister wharton woke up instantly and made inquiry of his daughter
there had however been a few words spoken on the subject between missus roby and her niece which had served to prepare emily for what was coming lopez has been to your father
if he did not mean you to choose for yourself why didnt he keep a closer look out i havent chosen any one aunt harriet well to speak fairly i thought you had and i have nothing to say against your choice
no doubt your papa will have it out with you just now so you had better make up your mind what you will say to him if you really like the man i dont see why you shouldnt say so and stick to it he has made a regular offer and girls in these days are not expected to be their fathers slaves
missus roby was pleased with little intrigues was addicted to the amusement of fostering love affairs was fond of being thought to be useful in such matters and was not averse to having presents given to her she had married a vulgar man
and though she had not become like the man she had become vulgar she was not an eligible companion for mister whartons daughter a matter as to which the father had not given himself proper opportunities of learning the facts an aunt in his close neighbourhood was so great a comfort to him
so ready and so natural an assistance to him in his difficulties but emily wharton was not in the least like her aunt nor had missus wharton been at all like missus roby no doubt the contact was dangerous
injury had perhaps already been done it may be that some slightest soil had already marred the pure white of the girls natural character but if so the stain was as yet too impalpable to be visible to ordinary eyes
rather exceeding the average proportions as well as height of women her features were regular and handsome and her form was perfect but it was by her manner and her voice that she conquered rather than by her beauty
which strangers did not find on her face but as we do not light up our houses with our brightest lamps for all comers so neither did she emit from her eyes their brightest sparks till special occasion for such shining had arisen
to those who were allowed to love her no woman was more lovable there was innate in her an appreciation of her own position as a woman and with it a principle of self denial as a human being which it was beyond the power of any missus roby to destroy
the young man may become lord chancellor or at any rate earn his bread comfortably as a county court judge but the girl can look forward to little else than the chance of having a good man for her husband a good man
or if her tastes lie in that direction a rich man emily wharton had doubtless thought about these things and she sincerely believed that she had found the good man in ferdinand lopez
when going to mister wharton at his chambers he had not intended to cheat the lawyer into any erroneous idea about his family
and mister wharton had felt himself bound to abstain from allusion to such matters from an assured feeling that he could not in that direction plant an enduring objection in this way lopez had carried his point with mister wharton
and this he had done without ever having asked for her love and he had even taken the trouble to allure dick and had listened to and had talked whole pages out of bells life on his own behalf it must be acknowledged
that he did love the girl as well perhaps as he was capable of loving any one but he had found out many particulars as to mister whartons money before he had allowed himself to love her as soon as missus roby had gathered up her knitting
and declared as she always did on such occasions that she could go round the corner without having any one to look after her
he came to me to day and asked for my permission to address you she sat perfectly quiet still looking at him but she did not say a word of course i did not give him permission why of course papa
because he is a stranger and a foreigner would you have wished me to tell him that he might come yes papa he was sitting on a sofa and shrank back a little from her as she made this free avowal
in that case i could have judged for myself i suppose every girl would like to do that but should you have accepted him i think i should have consulted you before i did that but i should have wished to accept him papa i do love him
i have never said so before to any one i would not say so to you now if he had not spoken to you as he has done emily it must not be why not papa if you say it shall not be so it shall not
i will do as you bid me then he put out his hand and caressed her stroking down her hair but i think you ought to tell me why it must not be
he is a foreigner but is he and why should not a foreigner be as good as an englishman his name is foreign but he talks english and lives as an englishman he has no relatives no family no belongings
he is what we call an adventurer marriage my dear is a most serious thing yes papa i know that one is bound to be very careful how can i give you to a man i know nothing about an adventurer
what would they say in herefordshire i dont know why they should say anything but if they did i shouldnt much care i should my dear i should care very much one is bound to think of ones family suppose it should turn out afterwards that he was
disreputable you may say that of any man papa but when a man has connexions a father and mother or uncles and aunts people that everybody knows about then there is some guarantee of security
did you ever hear this man speak of his father i dont know that i ever did or his mother or his family dont you think that is suspicious
i would not wish that there should be opportunity for such asking if there has been intimacy between you such information should have come naturally as a thing of course you have made him no promise oh no papa
nor spoken to him of your regard for him never not a word nor he to me except in such words as one understands even though they say nothing i wish he had never seen you is he a bad man papa
papa i wish you knew him better than you do i do not want to know him better is not that prejudice papa my dear emily said mister wharton striving to wax into anger
that he might be firm against her i dont think that it becomes you to ask your father such a question as that you ought to believe that it is the chief object of my life to do the best i can for my children i am sure it is
and you ought to feel that as i have had a long experience in the world my judgment about a young man might be trusted that was a statement which miss wharton was not prepared to admit
she had already professed herself willing to submit to her fathers judgment and did not now by any means contemplate rebellion against parental authority but she did feel that on a matter so vital to her
she had a right to plead her cause before judgment should be given and she was not slow to assure herself even as this interview went on that her love for the man was strong enough to entitle her to assure her father that her happiness depended on his reversal of the sentence
already pronounced you know papa that i trust you she said and i have promised you that i will not disobey you
you are a good girl you were always a good girl but i think that you ought to hear me then he stood still with his hands in his trowsers pockets looking at her
he did not want to hear a word but he felt that he would be a tyrant if he refused if you tell me that i am not to see him i shall not see him but i shall be very unhappy i do love him and i shall never love any one else in the same way
if it is only because mister lopez has a foreign name it isnt only that no one knows anything about him or where to inquire even i think you should inquire papa and be quite certain before you pronounce such a sentence against me
it will be a crushing blow he looked at her and saw that there was a fixed purpose in her countenance of which he had never before seen similar signs you claim a right to my obedience and i acknowledge it
i am sure you believe me when i promise not to see him without your permission i do believe you of course i believe you but if i do that for you papa i think that you ought to be very sure on my account
i will of course i will and he began the process of thinking about it immediately before the door was closed behind her but what was there to think about nothing that she had said altered in the least his idea about the man
he was as convinced as ever that unless there was much to conceal there would not be so much concealment but a feeling began to grow upon him already that his daughter had a mode of pleading with him which he would not ultimately be able to resist
he had the power he knew of putting an end to the thing altogether he had only to say resolutely and unchangeably that the thing shouldnt be and it wouldnt be
they were habitually indifferent to self exaltation and allowed themselves to be thrust into this or that unfitting role professing that the queens government and the good of the country were their only considerations
because it was felt on all sides that sir orlando could not join the new composite party without high place and the same grace was shown in regard to lord drummond who remained at the colonies keeping the office to which he had been lately transferred under mister daubeny
for legal offices have a signification differing much from that which attaches itself to places simply political a lord chancellor becomes a peer and on going out of office enjoys a large pension when the woolsack has been reached there comes an end of doubt
and a beginning of ease sir gregory was not a young man and this was a terrible blow but he bore it manfully saying not a word when the duke spoke to him but he became convinced from that moment that no more inefficient lawyer ever sat upon the english bench
or a more presumptuous politician in the british parliament than lord ramsden the real struggle however lay in the appropriate distribution of the rattlers and the robys the fitzgibbons and the macphersons among the subordinate offices of state
mister macpherson and mister roby with a host of others who had belonged to mister daubeny were prepared as they declared from the first to lend their assistance to the duke they had consulted mister daubeny on the subject and mister daubeny told them that their duty lay in that direction
at the first blush of the matter the arrangement took the form of a gracious tender from themselves to a statesman called upon to act in very difficult circumstances and they were thanked accordingly by the duke with something of real cordial gratitude
he was astounded not so much by the pretensions as by the unblushing assertion of these pretensions in reference to places which he had been innocent enough to think were always bestowed at any rate without direct application he had measured himself rightly when he told the older duke
in one of those anxious conversations which had been held before the attempt was made that long as he had been in office himself he did not know what was the way of bestowing office two gentlemen have been here this morning he said one day to the duke of saint bungay
one on the heels of the other each assuring me not only that the whole stability of the enterprise depends on my giving a certain office to him but actually telling me to my face that i had promised it to him the old statesman laughed
to be told within the same half hour by two men that i had made promises to each of them inconsistent with each other who were the two men mister rattler and mister roby i am assured that they are inseparable since the work was begun
they always had a leaning to each other and now i hear they pass their time between the steps of the carlton and reform clubs but what am i to do one must be patronage secretary no doubt theyre both good men in their way you know
but why do they come to me with their mouths open like dogs craving a bone it used not to be so of course men were always anxious for office as they are now well yes weve heard of that before to day i think
but i dont think any man ever ventured to ask mister mildmay time had done much for him in consolidating his authority and perhaps the present world is less reticent in its eagerness than it was in his younger days i doubt however
whether it is more dishonest and whether struggles were not made quite as disgraceful to the strugglers as anything that is done now you cant alter the men and you must use them the younger duke sat down and sighed over the degenerate patriotism of the age
but at last even the rattlers and robys were fixed if not satisfied and a complete list of the ministry appeared in all the newspapers though the thing had been long a doing still it had come suddenly
so that at the first proposition to form a coalition ministry the newspapers had hardly known whether to assist or to oppose the scheme there was no doubt in the minds of all these editors and contributors the teaching of a tradition that coalitions of this kind have been generally feeble
sometimes disastrous and on occasions even disgraceful when a man perhaps through a long political life has bound himself to a certain code of opinions how can he change that code at a moment
and when at the same moment together with the change he secures power patronage and pay how shall the public voice absolve him but then again men who have by the work of their lives grown into a certain position in the country
and have unconsciously but not therefore less actually made themselves indispensable either to this side in politics or to that cannot free themselves altogether from the responsibility of managing them when a period comes such as that now reached
this also the newspapers perceived and having since the commencement of the session been very loud in exposing the disgraceful collapse of government affairs could hardly refuse their support to any attempt at a feasible arrangement
when it was first known that the duke of omnium had consented to make the attempt they had both on one side and the other been loud in his praise going so far as to say that he was the only man in england who could do the work
but when the newspapers told him that he was the only man for the occasion how could he be justified in crediting himself in preference to them the work in parliament began under the new auspices with great tranquillity
and further education questions all men knew who knew anything but for the moment for the month even perhaps for the session there was to be peace with full latitude for the performance of routine duties there was so to say no opposition
and at first it seemed that one special bench in the house of commons would remain unoccupied but after a day or two on one of which mister daubeny had been seen sitting just below the gangway that gentleman returned to the place usually held by the prime ministers rival
saying with a smile that it might be for the convenience of the house that the seat should be utilised mister gresham at this time had with declared purpose asked and obtained the speakers leave of absence and was abroad who should lead the house
that had been a great question caused by the fact that the prime minister was in the house of lords and what office should the leader hold mister monk had consented to take the exchequer
was at last assigned to sir orlando drought it will never do said mister rattler to mister roby i dont mean to say anything against drought who has always been a very useful man to your party but he lacks something of the position
the fact is said roby that weve trusted to two men so long that we dont know how to suppose any one else big enough to fill their places monk wouldnt have done the house doesnt care about monk i always thought it should be wilson
and so i told the duke he had an idea that it should be one of your men i think hes right there said roby there ought to be something like a fair division individuals might be content but the party would be dissatisfied
for myself id have sooner stayed out as an independent member but daubeny said that he thought i was bound to make myself useful i told the duke from the beginning said rattler that i didnt think that i could be of any service to him
of course i would support him but i had been too thoroughly a party man for a new movement of this kind but he said just the same that he considered i was bound to join him i asked gresham and when gresham said so too of course i had no help for it
a meaning to a mans words exactly opposite to that which another tone would convey or if he does lie in doing so he does not know that he lies mister rattler had gone back to his old office at the treasury
and mister roby had been forced to content himself with the secretaryship at the admiralty but as the old duke had said they were close friends and prepared to fight together any battle which might keep them in their present position
many of the cares of office the prime minister did succeed in shuffling off altogether on to the shoulders of his elder friend he would not concern himself with the appointment of ladies about whom he said he knew nothing
and as to whose fitness and claims he professed himself to be as ignorant as the office messenger the offers were of course made in the usual form as though coming direct from the queen through the prime minister but the selections were in truth effected by the old duke in council with
an illustrious personage the matter affected our duke only in so far that he could not get out of his mind that strange application from his own wife that she should have even dreamed of it he would say to himself
the desire for ploughing had come upon the duchess but the duke could not understand it he perceived however in spite of the multiplicity of his official work that his refusal sat heavily on his wifes breast and that though she spoke no further word
she brooded over her injury and his heart was sad within him when he thought that he had vexed her loving her as he did with all his heart but with a heart that was never demonstrative when she was unhappy he was miserable
though he would hardly know the cause of his misery her ridicule and raillery he could bear
or her sullenness if ever she were sullen upset him altogether he was in truth so soft of heart
he had expressly asked her for her sympathy in the business he had on hand thereby going much beyond his usual coldness of manner
had promised that she would slave for him if slavery were necessary then she had made her request had been refused and was now moody the duchess of
is to be mistress of the robes he said to her one day he had gone to her up to her own room before he dressed for dinner having devoted much more time than as prime minister he ought to have done to a resolution that he would make things straight with her and to the best way of doing it
so i am told she ought to know her way about the place as i remember she was at the same work when i was a girl of eleven thats not so very long ago cora silverbridge is older now than i was then
and i think that makes it a very long time ago lord silverbridge was the dukes eldest son but what does it matter if she began her career in the time of george the fourth what is it to you
its a pity she should not remember hers in the way she dresses said the duchess this was marvellous to him that his wife
that it wont come within the compass of my office to effect or even to propose any radical change in her graces apparel but dont you think that you and i can afford to ignore all that i can certainly she may be an antiquated eve for me
i hope cora you are not still disappointed because i did not agree with you when you spoke about the place for yourself not because you did not agree with me but because you did not think me fit to be trusted with any judgment of my own
and free from bonds by which they are cramped and confined of course such a turn of character is subject to certain dangers of its own there is no doubt about the dangers the chances are that when i see her grace i shall tell her what i think about her
you will i am sure say nothing unkind to a lady who is supposed to be in the place she now fills by my authority but do not let us quarrel about an old woman i wont quarrel with you even about a young one
you do not know how constantly i carry you about with me you carry a very unnecessary burden then she said but he could tell at once from the altered tone of her voice and from the light of her eye as he glanced into her face
that her anger about the robes was appeased i have done as you asked about a friend of yours he said this occurred just before the final and perfected list of the new men had appeared in all the newspapers what friend
mister finn is to go to ireland go to ireland how do you mean it is looked upon as being very great promotion indeed i am told that he is considered to be the luckiest man in all the scramble you dont mean as chief secretary
yes i do he certainly couldnt go as lord lieutenant but they said that barrington erle was going to ireland well yes i dont know that youd be interested by all the ins and outs of it
the one man in parliament modest enough not to consider himself to be fit for any place that can be offered to him poor barrington he does not like the idea of crossing the channel so often i quite sympathise with him and so phineas is to be secretary for ireland
not in the cabinet no not in the cabinet it is not by any means usual that he should be that is promotion and i am glad poor phineas i hope they wont murder him or anything of that kind
they do murder people you know sometimes hes an irishman himself thats just the reason why they should he must put up with that of course i wonder whether shell like going theyll be able to spend money which they always like
over there he comes backwards and forwards every week doesnt he not quite that i believe i shall miss her if she has to stay away long i know you dont like her i do like her
she has always behaved well both to me and to my uncle she was an angel to him
this she said with a smile as though not meaning it altogether but yet half meaning it i have asked him to undertake the office said the duke solemnly because i am told that he is fit for it
but i did have some pleasure in proposing it to him because i thought that it would please you it does please me and i wont be cross any more and the duchess of
but she is in truth the only woman in london to whom i can say what i think and it is a comfort you know to have some one in this way the domestic peace of the prime minister was readjusted
and that sympathy and co operation for which he had first asked was accorded to him it may be a question whether on the whole the duchess did not work harder than he did
in regard to magnificence and hospitality she said nothing of any extraordinary expenditure of money but she set herself to work after her own fashion making to him suggestions as to dinners and evening receptions
to which he objected only on the score of time you must eat your dinner somewhere she said and you need only come in just before we sit down and go into your own room if you please without coming upstairs at all i can at any rate do that part of it for you
chapter thirteen somebody runs away school is done now well have fun sung bab and betty
tired teacher had dismissed them for eight whole weeks and gone away to rest the little school house was shut up lessons were over spirits rising fast and vacation had begun the quiet town seemed suddenly inundated with children
all in such a rampant state that busy mothers wondered how they ever should be able to keep their frisky darlings out of mischief thrifty fathers planned how they could bribe the idle hands to pick berries or rake hay and the old folks
while wishing the young folks well secretly blessed the man who invented schools the girls immediately began to talk about picnics and have them too for little hats sprung up in the fields like a new sort of mushroom
every hillside bloomed with gay gowns looking as if the flowers had gone out for a walk and the woods were full of featherless birds chirping away as blithely as the thrushes robins and wrens
the boys took to base ball like ducks to water and the common was the scene of tremendous battles waged with much tumult but little bloodshed to the uninitiated it appeared as if these young men had lost their wits
for no matter how warm it was there they were tearing about in the maddest manner jackets off sleeves rolled up queer caps flung on any way all batting shabby leather balls and catching the same
as if their lives depended on it every one talking in his gruffest tone bawling at the top of his voice squabbling over every point of the game and seeming to enjoy himself immensely in spite of the heat dust uproar
and imminent danger of getting eyes or teeth knocked out thorny was an excellent player but not being strong enough to show his prowess he made ben his proxy and sitting on the fence acted as umpire to his hearts content
ben was a promising pupil and made rapid progress for eye foot and hand had been so well trained that they did him good service now and brown was considered a first rate catcher
and guarding jackets when not needed with the air of one of the old guard on duty at the tomb of napoleon bab also longed to join in the fun which suited her better than stupid picnics or fussing over dolls
but her heroes would not have her at any price and she was obliged to content herself with sitting by thorny and watching with breathless interest the varying fortunes of our side a grand match was planned for the fourth of july but when the club met
unpropitious thorny had gone out of town with his sister to pass the day two of the best players did not appear and the others were somewhat exhausted by the festivities which began at sunrise for them
so they lay about on the grass in the shade of the big elm languidly discussing their various wrongs and disappointments its the meanest fourth i ever saw cant have no crackers because somebodys horse got scared last year
growled sam kitteridge bitterly resenting the stern edict which forbade free born citizens to burn as much gunpowder as they liked on that glorious day last year jimmy got his arm blown off when they fired the old cannon
didnt we have a lively time going for the doctors and getting him home asked another boy looking as if he felt defrauded of the most interesting part of the anniversary because no accident had occurred aint going to be fireworks either unless somebodys
barn burns up dont i just wish there would gloomily responded another youth who had so rashly indulged in pyrotechnics on a former occasion that a neighbors cow had been roasted whole
i wouldnt give two cents for such a slow old place as this why last fourth at this time
all in my best toggery hot as pepper but good fun looking in at the upper windows and hearing the women scream when the old thing waggled round and i made believe i was going to tumble off said ben
and felt some natural regret at descending from so lofty a sphere catch me cuttin away if i had such a chance as that answered sam trying to balance his bat on his chin
and getting a smart rap across the nose as he failed to perform the feat much you know about it old chap its hard work i can tell you and that wouldnt suit such a lazy bones then you are too big to begin
though you might do for a fat boy if smithers wanted one said ben surveying the stout youth with calm contempt lets go in swimming not loaf round here if we cant play
proposed a red and shiny boy panting for a game of leap frog in sandy pond may as well dont see much else to do sighed sam rising like a young elephant the others were about to follow
tearing down the street like a runaway colt waving a long strip of paper as he ran now then whats the matter demanded ben as the other came up grinning and puffing but full of great news
panted billy putting the paper into sams hand and surveying the crowd with a face as beaming as a full moon look out for the big show read sam
new great golden menagerie circus and colosseum will exhibit at berryville july fourth at one and seven precisely admission fifty cents children half price
dont forget day and date h frost manager while sam read the other boys had been gloating over the enticing pictures which covered the bill there was the golden car
filled with noble beings in helmets all playing on immense trumpets the twenty four prancing steeds with manes tails and feathered heads tossing in the breeze the clowns the tumblers the strong men
and the riders flying about in the air as if the laws of gravitation no longer existed but best of all was the grand conglomeration of animals where the giraffe appears to stand on the elephants back
the zebra to be jumping over the seal the hippopotamus to be lunching off a couple of crocodiles and lions and tigers to be raining down in all directions with their mouths wide open and their tails as stiff as that of the famous northumberland house lion
cricky wouldnt i like to see that said little cyrus fay devoutly hoping that the cage in which this pleasing spectacle took place was a very strong one you never would its only a picture
that now is something like and ben who had pricked up his ears at the word circus laid his finger on a smaller cut of a man hanging by the back of his neck with a child in each hand two men suspended from his feet
and the third swinging forward to alight on his head i m going said sam with calm decision for this superb array of unknown pleasures fired his soul and made him forget his weight how will you fix it asked ben
just as he used to feel it when his father caught him up to dash into the ring foot it with billy its only four miles and weve got lots of time so we can take it easy mother wont care if i send word by cy
answered sam producing half a dollar as if such magnificent sums were no strangers to his pocket come on brown youll be a first rate fellow to show us round as you know all the dodges said billy
anxious to get his moneys worth well i dont know began ben longing to go but afraid missus moss would say no if he asked leave hes afraid sneered the red faced boy
who felt bitterly toward all mankind at that instant because he knew there was no hope of his going say that again and ill knock your head off and ben faced round with a gesture which caused the other to skip out of reach precipitately
hasnt got any money more likely observed a shabby youth whose pockets never had any thing in them but a pair of dirty hands ben calmly produced a dollar bill and waved it defiantly before this doubter
observing with dignity ive got money enough to treat the whole crowd if i choose to which i dont then come along and have a jolly time with sam and me we can buy some dinner and get a ride home as like as not
said the amiable billy with a slap on the shoulder and a cordial grin which made it impossible for ben to resist what are you stopping for demanded sam ready to be off that they might take it easy
hell get lost or stolen if i take him and its too far to carry him home if you are in a hurry began ben persuading himself that this was the true reason of his delay let cy take him back hell do it for a cent wont you cy proposed billy
smoothing away all objections for he liked ben and saw that he wanted to go no i wont i dont like him he winks at me and growls when i touch him muttered naughty cy remembering how much reason poor sanch had to distrust his tormentor
there s bab shell do it come here sissy ben wants you called sam beckoning to a small figure just perching on the fence down it jumped and came fluttering up
i want you to take sanch home and tell your mother im going to walk and may be wont be back till sundown miss celia said i might do what i pleased all day you remember now
ben spoke without looking up and affected to be very busy buckling a strap into sanchs collar for the two were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled it was a mistake on bens part for
while his eyes were on his work babs were devouring the bill which sam still held
you just catch hold of this and run along home lock sanch up for an hour and tell your mother im all right answered ben bound to assert his manly supremacy before his mates hes going to the circus
whispered fay hoping to make mischief circus
falling into a state of great excitement at the mere thought of such delight you couldnt walk four miles began ben yes i could as easy as not you havent got any money you have i saw you showing your dollar
and you could pay for me and ma would pay it back cant wait for you to get ready ill go as i am i dont care if it is my old hat and bab jerked it on to her head your mother wouldnt like it she wont like your going either
she isnt my missis now miss celia wouldnt care and im going any way do do take me ben ill be just as good as ever was
dont you bother we dont want any girls tagging after us said sam walking off to escape the annoyance ill bring you a roll of chickerberry lozengers if you wont tease
whispered kind hearted billy with a consoling pat on the crown of the shabby straw hat when the circus comes here you shall go certain sure and betty too said ben feeling mean while he proposed what he knew was a hollow mockery
they never do come to such little towns you said so and i think you are very cross and i wont take care of sanch so now cried bab getting into a passion yet ready to cry she was so disappointed
i suppose it wouldnt do hinted billy with a look from ben to the little girl who stood winking hard to keep the tears back of course it wouldnt id like to see her walking eight miles
girls are such a bother when you want to knock round no bab you cant go travel right home and dont make a fuss come along boys
and we dont want to walk fast ben spoke very decidedly and taking billys arm away they went leaving poor bab and sanch to watch them out of sight one sobbing the other whining dismally
somehow those two figures seemed to go before ben all along the pleasant road and half spoilt his fun for though he laughed and talked cut canes and seemed as merry as a grig
he could not help feeling that he ought to have asked leave to go and been kinder to bab
if id told her id like to show her round and shes been real good to me no use now ill take the girls a lot of candy and make it all right he tried to settle it in that way and trudged gayly off
and planning to do the honors handsomely to the boys it was very warm and just outside of the town they paused by a wayside watering trough to wash their dusty faces
and cool off before plunging into the excitements of the afternoon as they stood refreshing themselves a bakers cart came jingling by and sam proposed a hasty lunch while they rested a supply of gingerbread was soon bought
and climbing the green bank above they lay on the grass under a wild cherry tree munching luxuriously while they feasted their eyes at the same time on the splendors awaiting them for the great tent with all its flags flying
was visible from the hill well cut across those fields
i want to have a good go at every thing especially the lions said sam beginning on his last cookie i heard em roar just now and billy stood up to gaze with big eyes at the flapping canvas
which hid the king of beasts from his longing sight that was a cow mooing dont you be a donkey bill when you hear a real roar youll shake in your boots said ben holding up his handkerchief to dry
i wish youd hurry up sam folks are going in now i see em and billy pranced with impatience for this was his first circus and he firmly believed that he was going to behold all that the pictures promised
hold on a minute while i get one more drink buns are dry fodder said sam rolling over to the edge of the bank and preparing to descend with as little trouble as possible he nearly went down head first however for
as he looked before he leaped he beheld a sight which caused him to stare with all his might for an instant then turn and beckon saying in an eager whisper
and both suppressed an astonished hullo for there stood bab waiting for sancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough such a shabby tired looking couple as they were
bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked with tears shoes white with dust playfrock torn at the gathers something bundled up in her apron and one shoe down at the heel as if it hurt her
sancho lapped eagerly with his eyes shut all his ruffles were gray with dust and his tail hung wearily down the tassel at half mast as if in mourning for the master whom he had come to find
bab still held the strap intent on keeping her charge safe though she lost herself but her courage seemed to be giving out as she looked anxiously up and down the road
seeing no sign of the three familiar figures she had been following as steadily as a little indian on the war trail oh sanch what shall i do if they dont come along we must have gone by them somewhere for i dont see any one that way
and there isnt any other road to the circus seems to me bab spoke as if the dog could understand and answer
and fixing his sharp eyes on the grass above him gave a suspicious bark its only squirrels dont mind but come along and be good for i m so tired i dont know what to do sighed bab
trying to pull him after her as she trudged on bound to see the outside of that wonderful tent even if she never got in but sancho had heard a soft chirrup and with a sudden bound twitched the strap away sprang up the bank
and landed directly on bens back as he lay peeping over a peal of laughter greeted him and having got the better of his master in more ways than one he made the most of the advantage by playfully worrying him as he kept him down
licking his face in spite of his struggles burrowing in his neck with a ticklish nose snapping at his buttons and yelping joyfully as if it was the best joke in the world to play hide and seek for four long miles
before ben could quiet him bab came climbing up the bank with such a funny mixture of fear fatigue determination and relief in her dirty little face
that the boys could not look awful if they tried how dared you come after us miss demanded sam as she looked calmly about her and took a seat before she was asked sanch would come after ben
i couldnt make him go home so i had to hold on till he was safe here else hed be lost and then ben would feel bad the cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely
and sam tried again while ben was getting the dog down and sitting on him now you expect to go to the circus i suppose course i do ben said he didnt mind paying if i could get there without bothering him and i have
and ill go home alone i aint afraid sanch will take care of me if you wont answered bab stoutly what do you suppose your mother will say to you asked ben feeling much reproached by her last words
i guess shell say you led me into mischief and the sharp child nodded as if she defied him to deny the truth of that
advised sam thinking bab great fun
what would you have done if you hadnt found us asked billy forgetting his impatience in his admiration for this plucky young lady id have gone on and seen the circus
was the prompt answer but you havent any money oh id ask somebody to pay for me i m so little it wouldnt be much
i thought of that and planned how id fix it if i didnt find ben id make sanch do his tricks and get a quarter that way so now answered bab undaunted by any obstacle i do believe she would
you are a smart child bab and if i had enough id take you in myself said billy heartily for having sisters of his own he kept a soft place in his heart for girls especially enterprising ones
ill take care of her it was very naughty to come bab but so long as you did you neednt worry about any thing ill see to you and you shall have a real good time said ben accepting his responsibilities without a murmur
and bound to do the handsome thing by his persistent friend i thought you would and bab folded her arms as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself are you hungry asked billy
fishing out several fragments of gingerbread starving and bab ate them with such a relish that sam added a small contribution and ben caught some water for her in his hand where the little spring bubbled up beside a stone now
commanded ben giving sanch a roll on the grass to clean him bab scrubbed her face till it shone and pulling down her apron to wipe it scattered a load of treasures collected in her walk some of the dead flowers
bits of moss and green twigs fell near ben and one attracted his attention a spray of broad smooth leaves with a bunch of whitish berries on it where did you get that he asked poking it with his foot
in a swampy place coming along sanch saw something down there and i went with him cause i thought may be it was a musk rat and youd like one if we could get him
and with intense interest no only a snake and i dont care for snakes i picked some of that it was so green and pretty thorny likes queer leaves and berries you know answered bab spatting down her rough locks
well he wont like that nor you either
and i shouldnt wonder if youd got poisoned bab dont touch it
and ben looked anxiously at bab who felt her chubby face all over and examined her dingy hands with a solemn air asking eagerly will it break out on me fore i get to the circus
not for a day or so i guess but its bad when it does come
a perilous night on shastas summit toward the end of summer after a light open winter one may reach the summit of mount shasta without passing over much snow by keeping on the crest of a long narrow ridge
mostly bare that extends from near the camp ground at the timberline but on my first excursion to the summit the whole mountain down to its low swelling base was smoothly laden with loose fresh snow
presenting a most glorious mass of winter mountain scenery in the midst of which i scrambled and reveled or lay snugly snowbound enjoying the fertile clouds and the snow bloom in all their growing drifting grandeur
the first rains had fallen on the lowlands and the first snows on the mountains and everything was fresh and bracing while an abundance of balmy sunshine filled all the noonday hours
it was the calm afterglow that usually succeeds the first storm of the winter i met many of the birds that had reared their young and spent their summer in the shasta woods and chaparral they were then on their way south to their winter homes
leading their young full fledged and about as large and strong as the parents squirrels dry and elastic after the storms were busy about their stores of pine nuts and the latest goldenrods were still in bloom though it was now past the middle of october
the grand color glow the autumnal jubilee of ripe leaves was past prime but freshened by the rain was still making a fine show along the banks of the river and in the ravines and the dells of the smaller streams
at the salmon hatching establishment on the mc cloud river i halted a week to examine the limestone belt grandly developed there to learn what i could of the inhabitants of the river and its banks
and to give time for the fresh snow that i knew had fallen on the mountain to settle somewhat with a view to making the ascent a pedestrian on these mountain roads especially so late in the year is sure to excite curiosity
and many were the interrogations concerning my ramble when i said that i was simply taking a walk and that icy shasta was my mark i was invariably admonished that i had come on a dangerous quest the time was far too late
the snow was too loose and deep to climb and i should be lost in drifts and slides when i hinted that new snow was beautiful and storms not so bad as they were called my advisers shook their heads in token of superior knowledge
and declared the ascent of shasta butte through loose snow impossible nevertheless before noon of the second of november i was in the frosty azure of the utmost summit when i arrived at sissons everything was quiet
and i was in haste to be off and get myself established somewhere in the midst of it whether the summit was to be attained or not sisson who is a mountaineer speedily fitted me out for storm or calm as only a mountaineer could
and the frosts and the dangers of mountaineering so late in the year therefore i could not ask a guide to go with me even had one been willing all i wanted was to have blankets and provisions deposited as far up in the timber as the snow would permit a pack animal to go
there i could build a storm nest and lie warm and make raids up and around the mountain in accordance with the weather setting out on the afternoon of november first with jerome fay mountaineer and guide in charge of the animals
the snow of course growing steadily deeper and looser so that we had to break a trail the animals began to get discouraged and after night and darkness came on they became entangled in a bed of rough lava
where breaking through four or five feet of mealy snow their feet were caught between angular boulders here they were in danger of being lost but after we had removed packs and saddles and assisted their efforts with ropes
they all escaped to the side of a ridge about a thousand feet below the timberline to go farther was out of the question so we were compelled to camp as best we could a pitch pine fire speedily changed the temperature
and shed a blaze of light on the wild lava slope and the straggling storm bent pines around us melted snow answered for coffee and we had plenty of venison to roast toward midnight i rolled myself in my blankets slept an hour and a half
and indicated the way as well as he could in the darkness he seemed loath to leave me but being reassured that i was at home and required no care he bade me good bye and returned to camp ready to lead his animals down the mountain at daybreak
alone in the solemn silence of the night half the sky was clouded in the other half the stars sparkled icily in the keen frosty air while everywhere the glorious wealth of snow
fell away from the summit of the cone in flowing folds more extensive and continuous than any i had ever seen before when day dawned the clouds were crawling slowly and becoming more massive but gave no intimation of immediate danger
in blank exposure to the deep upper currents of the sky and no labyrinth of peaks and canyons i had ever been in seemed to me so dangerous as these immense slopes bare against the sky
the frost was intense and drifting snow dust made breathing at times rather difficult the snow was as dry as meal and the finer particles drifted freely rising high in the air while the larger portions of the crystals rolled like sand
i frequently sank to my armpits between buried blocks of loose lava but generally only to my knees when tired with walking i still wallowed slowly upward on all fours the steepness of the slope
thirty five degrees in some places made any kind of progress fatiguing while small avalanches were being constantly set in motion in the steepest places but the bracing air and the sublime beauty of the snowy expanse
thrilled every nerve and made absolute exhaustion impossible i seemed to be walking and wallowing in a cloud but holding steadily onward by half past ten oclock i had gained the highest summit
i held my commanding foothold in the sky for two hours gazing on the glorious landscapes spread maplike around the immense horizon and tracing the outlines of the ancient lava streams extending far into the surrounding plains
and the pathways of vanished glaciers of which shasta had been the center but as i had left my coat in camp for the sake of having my limbs free in climbing i soon was cold the wind increased in violence
raising the snow in magnificent drifts that were drawn out in the form of wavering banners blowing in the sun toward the end of my stay a succession of small clouds struck against the summit rocks like drifting icebergs
darkening the air as they passed and producing a chill as definite and sudden as if ice water had been dashed in my face this is the kind of cloud in which snow flowers grow and i turned and fled
i reached camp about an hour before dusk hollowed a strip of loose ground in the lee of a large block of red lava where firewood was abundant rolled myself in my blankets and went to sleep next morning
having slept little the night before the ascent and being weary with climbing after the excitement was over i slept late then awaking suddenly my eyes opened on one of the most beautiful and sublime scenes i ever enjoyed a boundless wilderness of storm clouds
undulating hill and dale smooth purple plains and silvery mountains of cumuli range over range diversified with peak and dome and hollow fully brought out in light and shade i gazed enchanted
but cold gray masses drifting like dust on a wind swept plain began to shut out the light forerunners of the coming storm i had been so anxiously watching i made haste to gather as much wood as possible
the storm side of my blankets was fastened down with stakes to reduce as much as possible the sifting in of drift and the danger of being blown away the precious bread sack was placed safely as a pillow and when at length the first flakes fell
i was exultingly ready to welcome them most of my firewood was more than half rosin and would blaze in the face of the fiercest drifting the winds could not demolish my bed and my bread could be made to last indefinitely
while in case of need i had the means of making snowshoes and could retreat or hold my ground as i pleased presently the storm broke forth into full snowy bloom and the thronging crystals darkened the air
the wind swept past in hissing floods grinding the snow into meal and sweeping down into the hollows in enormous drifts all the heavier particles while the finer dust was sifted through the sky increasing the icy gloom
